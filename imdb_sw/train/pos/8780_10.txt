This is one of the biggest movies made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the most popular games of American history. What makes James J. Corbett's story interesting is that Mr. Corbett developed a boxing style that continues to this day. So James J. Corbett had a real innovation. But returning to the film, all the exhibitions were excellent. Alexis Smith was good. Indeed, he appeared as Nicole Kidman. And although it is a piece of the period, the story faces a test of time; is not off. Ward Bond's statement of John L. Sullivan should be one of the major exhibitions of real-time games in the history of movies and pigs are real, well-organized and effective. That with a great script makes this movie a must.
