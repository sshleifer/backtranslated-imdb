The Indian movie is similar to the two groups of two: they are a form of loyalty or evil. Faithful men always shout on their voices and fight against the system when evil fighters enjoy many places but face the end. <br /> <br /> This movie will at least break this common form and offers the enjoyable views of soldiers and their lives. Trends take a look into the life of a small arrogant soldier who. Music is interesting and editing is the manufacturer of trends far away from Indian movies going. <br /> <br /> Movie becomes slow in time and trouble that Anbu faces when Maya is interrupted sometimes. But I would like to give this only 9/10 because it has first first to credit it.
