*** 1/2 Out of ***** When I am not concerned with the fact that this is English dubbed version as some inspectors have mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to live in many Québécois hearts. However, this was a movie like a child that I did not admirer earnest; keep in mind that it is for the kids, I rate it on the basis of relatives. The story is of children on the winter breaks to create a terrible snow fortress, and pushing back-'n-out for controlling weapons such as snowballs and a mixture of other drugs, like hands without work and free while the same cool breaks lessons . If I had children, this is obviously the film I tried to make them curious, as the luck of snow reduced me when I was young, and I think even children today can agree, although with Pixar and all the animation of the computer, maybe I just outdated and don't realize that. In addition, the movie message is amazing allegorical and one positive for that, for children (and adults alike).
