Oliver! The music is my favorite. Music, characters, stories. It all just seems to be perfect. In this modern modern novel modern revolutionary music, Carol Reed director brings Broadway to hit life on the screen of the movie. <br /> <br /> Transition from music music to music is not easy. You need to have the right sound, the correct set, the correct script, and the correct play. All signals show yes for this play. It almost seems to be written for screens! Our story takes place in an old England where a boy named Oliver can do his job from outside the orphanage. He sends his way through the country to London where he meets a group of young people emerging, led by Dodger, talking to a smart, fast pocket. The leader of this group is called Fagin, an old colleague who sells all stolen goods. But all is not well suited to the city of London when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his girlfriend of love Nancy getting tangled up by Oliver, Fagin and his young soldiers, and the law. What follows is a wonderful story of love, love, and great numbers of music. If you like music or not, listen to one of these sounds and you will always entertain them. Oliver! is a victory over and out of action and is a temporary work time of art.
