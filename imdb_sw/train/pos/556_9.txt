Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan are taking their animals from Seattle to Alaska and toward Canada to claim. Once there, they have to deal with business woman Ruth Roman and a cold-cold, happy and fortunate woman James McIntire. John Wayne can talk more, but his good palwn Stewart did some of the west, very hard, and some director general Anthony Mann. In fact, I'd like to take this, and the order of strong action with beautiful melodrama, on North to Alaska any day! The Far Country has a breathing environment and a movie that must definitely have been hit on the widescreen. Also, there is good support with the most reliable Brennan, Roman (who is the chief), Corrine Calvet very good, and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guys, a kind that doesn't take too much. This can make two big bills with the other Mann / Stewart proposed very northwest, Bend Of The River.
