I had a good time to look at this picture, and I was very surprised at its great features. First, the film is not available for cheap cards, small settings, and innovative scientific devices. The work of the officials from the very poor (two attackers), non-professional (Herb Evers as a leading person), overstatement gothic (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant to the first level with Virginia Leith in the position of title as a victim of a live head against His will for the benefit of science and the desire of his fiance. However scripting is very good and talk is wonderful for this film ilk. Issues are full about the role of science and medicine in our lives and what their limits should be. This film is a film to think in many ways. However, you must not be deceitful with his real intent. It is a bad story about a man who struggles with his medical science who wants to wrap his feminine female body and perfect body, thus making a perfect woman for a man with the ability of the body and spirit. Another bright feature of the film is a sax music that breaks the power every time the doctor drives the city with the beauty of the female.
