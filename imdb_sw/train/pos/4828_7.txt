Rupert's friend gives performance, like Prince Albert, who raises "Young Victoria" with unexpected standards. He is very good. As we know, Queen Victoria fell in the dark, deep after the death of Prince Albert and looking at the eyes of the Ruper Friend I understood. The film does not take us to his death but to an event that can be costly for his life. The act of love. I believed, or I must say, he. I believed what he felt was true. No one or anyone gets anywhere near the love and delivery of the characteristics of Friendly Character. Emily Blunt is good but I didn't believe for a minute she was Victoria. No real meaning of the period. It may not be his fault but his head deserved crown.
