Frontier Siri has been reported and reported by several news agencies for long-term commitment to create the best stories of Star Trek and give an example of the partnership that was Gene Roddenberry's message. Their attitude towards homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different communities is higher or higher than the other series and movies. The value of production started as small and small but for more than 7 seasonal production productions has changed, the story is more complex, and visual images have found smooth and more interesting. In the 6th season of 1, the Revolution, there is one of the greatest wars in the history of Trek. Ships are delivered well and space war is amazing and exciting. A real attempt to Frontier is not a ship or nature, but it is people with cooperation and growth of characters. There is also a feeling for another series of Trek and movies and places and characters we know. I recommend a fan of Trek track breach and you will have obstacles!
