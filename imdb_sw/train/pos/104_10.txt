The film was shocked, the bed had no listings but the participants in the film did a good job. I am glad to have a b-class movies like this, the story is the primary and the most basic of the actors and they do, they do not need a million dollars budget to make the film just a mixture of b and the most common characters and the basic plot. I would like the way they had a road to themselves and that nobody else was around and what I was though it was interesting was that they didn't shut down the caf√© to put gear and that they did all from the police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job in demonstrating roles in hostage. This was a good film and I hope to see more as soon.
