Well, I think I emotionally attached to this film since it was the first one I went to see more than 10 times in the movies ... help me through my master's thesis, or rather put me from the work of it! <Br /> <br /> But after looking at it a few years (and many movies) later - it's a very beautiful stone that is! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in the most influential performance, and Jeremy Northam is perfect Mr Knightley - where does someone meet that person ??? <<< sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's side as Mrs. Bates is virtuoso acting better (oh, napkin, pole!) and others cast no disappointment either - Tone Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her harriet, and ewan McGregor is convincing a charm - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are perfect "impossible" couple <br /> <br /> Of course sets and dress, with a good soundtrack to contribute a lot of feelgood, almost Hobbiton-like! The atmosphere of the movie - although far from movies and art decorations go, is almost the case of overload watches. Very good, but a little more difficult may have shown the best condition of the period. But the good thing is, the film is not very suitable, and there is much fun - and some good layout layout - which puts it from the Sakramoni hole of Merry Old England. <br /> <br /> especially if it's more than a football scene - some good acting and leading here, and ending dance summary relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just beauty. Mercy that last proposal area goes for just a little too long - cut two shots (I can't imagine exactly what it is!) And it would be more in keeping with the rest of the movie <br /> <br. Gosh, I just realize (by reading the imdb list) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even being aware that he was - he seems to have much more to go to him, as an actor, than just to be gentle English moyothrob! Hmm, I think I need to pay my visit to a video shop ... <br /> <br /> Good movie. My favorite order by Jane Austen to date - though maybe Ang Lee's Sense and Attention is, actually say, the best movie, this is close to my heart - and I certainly appear more often! Watch as you can - and don't be too hard on his little imperfection. <br /> <br />
