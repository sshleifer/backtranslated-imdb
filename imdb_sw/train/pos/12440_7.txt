Recap: It's a business as usual in the Louche casino in Tanger. Casino is close to install and prepares for major activities the next day. The Louche owner and other employees leave at night, leaving the Glory. Suddenly a group of armed groups beat the casino, shoot wildly. Unknown to humility, they have already murdered Louche, and are now after the money hidden in the park. But no one is present, and still alive, in the casino knows the principle of opening the vault. The items themselves are a big booby that was hit by bombs so that the attackers can't hit the door as planned. Suddenly the humility looks at the eye and leader of the port groups in Miklos in the roulette game and their lives at risk. <br /> <br /> Feedback: This is a written review without connectivity that has had other media published about the simplicity of Blaise, if I haven't seen or read any of it. The first tip I like to do is that this is installed a little bit. Priority I thought this was exciting and war wits between Humility and Miklos as the main plot. Indeed, there are some breakdowns but not the most important or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As explained already the main plot and the main location of the charge, is the game between Humility and Miklos. It is an innovative and amazing way of revealing the history of the character, and by doing so a lot of stories are held out of the casino at the beginning. Someone said that it is close to a series of TV series, and the feeling is that it can actually serve as such. But, I felt the best way to establish behavior than many others did. I had no desire in the absence of action, rather than I enjoyed this game, the history of more than just movie action. <br /> <br /> I think two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden mainly reflects very gentle, and actually carries this characteristic of talent and talent. <br /> <br /> 7/10
