I would like to say this is one of the best animations I have ever seen. I liked the first time but in fact I accepted the second opinion, a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel conducts similar business in the box office. It seems, many people liked this film. The color of the best color (person, this looks good) and many good people (but clean) plays to be a great winner. The opening of 3-4 minutes and "Scat," is better as it followed later. "Sid" sloth (shown by John Leguizano), however, provides great humor in the movie. He usually has something interesting to say during all the movies. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the sound of the mammoth, the great character of the film, in fact, when Denis Leary is the worst-turned-off tiger sabotothi <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and beautiful but a good story, the feeling of how a little child eliminates a few characters. This does not consist of many songs, either: just one short one and nothing wrong, the language of wisdom. Like most animation movies, I would like more.
