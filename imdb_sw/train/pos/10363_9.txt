Spoilers Track: I took the book "Evil Angels" when the first came out without knowing anything of that case. Just to give journalists and the Australian people a break here, I was too far before I started questioning Chamberlain's innocence. In fact, the author gave the reader to understand why the public emerged from the conclusion they had made. John Bryson told the story as it was presented to jurors (and adapted to the media) of the pharmacy, the actelone plate (??), the point of Dr. James Cameron that the collar was cut off with scissors, that the child could not be taken entirely from his clothes and continued bonds, blood magazine blood, etc. all proven. After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying for no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was absolutely correct was not at all. It was also technical evidence, difficult for a member to understand. At the moment, beyond the testimony of hearing in the experiment, hardly anyone has ever heard of dingo attacking man; The people did not believe it was possible. All people were worried about the Seventh Day Adventists, whose origin made them as a cult, and all wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. It was not for volunteer lawyers who did not work who worked to investigate and deal with the testimony of the case, finding Azaria clothes later there would not be enough to get Lindy out of jail. The book accused me of this, and I refused to reach the conclusion of anyone's guilt since (except JO of course). I was glad that the film will be made on the case and I don't think it would be done well. I've always loved Sam all the time, which I could really recognize, and Meryl was perfect as always. The beauty of photography, disgusting music. I think it's not just good, but it's very important, the movie. The worst did not receive more broadcast when it was given.
