Modern modern stories about stress that work to unlock and finally unbind marriage promises. The main purpose of the story comes from the 'homily' used by the country priest after the wedding ceremony of the white young couple from Milan. In it, the future course of marriage is written, which is little for the destruction of modern life problems. 'The ethics' of this story in the story is that in order for marriage to work, both now, and in the past, has been important for that relationship to be concerned with family and friends. This film was a relative barrier to local Italian standards. It is a terrible shame that this film is not available for DVD or VHS either.
