When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stood violently on the edge of the balcony on the city, apparently with hypnotized and close to his death stage, he immediately reminded me of the same scene in another film held nine years later, "Woman in Green" where Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is similar to isolating himself in space while feeling. For joy, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes live these experiments for the murder of ignorant criminals. An exciting movie of all these events. What? What will they learn that you cannot erase the minds of false spies?
