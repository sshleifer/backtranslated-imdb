Ok, this film was cool. I don't think it's the best movie made but it was certainly fun. My brother and I are still making events at once, and we will always open the movie out of the cup, lose dust and get in. Enjoys all the way to the end, but the main concept. This is a film that a person forgot about forgetting and just enjoying it. Judgment is the victory of Robot Jox.
