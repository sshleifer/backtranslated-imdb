For all suicides out there, this movie was beautiful! Every single character on the show made it appear on the film. It helped solve certain issues (but not all) from the series. Unfortunately, unless you were actually watching the series, the more fun would be lost, if the film made a lot of memory for the season of the show. This would be appropriate as a finale of the opposite series to be a different film, but we should take what we can find. I hope to make more films, and continue to include the killers of the killings on the Law and Procedures.
