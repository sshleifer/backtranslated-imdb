That has long been one of my favorite change of Austen novel. Although it is obviously not in the same category as "Interesting and Destructive" of interest, "Emma" is an honest and reliable television version of Austen's novel - especially based on its short height. Major changes between the novel and the movie are good, as the unwanted evil that Austen shows at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by someone more than Emma's character in another book. I thought the characters chosen to show the responsibilities were taken well. Kate Beckinsale walks a narrow line between the cunning and the snob of social and a completely lost grace in the edition of Gwyneth Paltrow. Samantha Morton's merchants tie his suit and his character as a co-operative with his role in the original attributes are replaced by Harriet we know from the book. The role of Mr. Knightly is done very well in my opinion; The weight and tenderness that the hero has built and in the novels are here in this very, very interesting film.
