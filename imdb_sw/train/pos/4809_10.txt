With all recent films, dealing with the Kingdom of England, is it another time? Answer: ANSWER! Young Victoria is another contribution to the wave of movies from the UK dealing with the Royal family. In this case, it deals with the early life of Princess Victoria, and the events generated by the Coronation of being the British Queen, with its romance & final wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the powerful life of the Queen & Prince of England, all of the other events that continue (political shock, etc.). Emily Blunt has a famous Victoria during her youth, when a Friend of Rupert is her dear friend & best, Prince Albert. All others have been beaten and pleasing to Miranda Richardson, like the Dutchess of Kent, and always welcome to the screens, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as cast to others who shine on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Love of Loser), leads from the winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Fair Exception, Gosford Park, Lies Differences). I left the top of my head on looking for film films (and movies of Hagen Bogdansker movies), who gave each film a look for color (with the help of a producer, Patrice Vermette), with some editing (for Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I liked also in Fellowes's lesson is the use of Chess game, as an example of the political motivation of the film (characters in the film rotating as pieces on the chess board). This is a smart, well-written, led, made, planned & entertainment (and lighting) that makes the evening well available on the movie. It was tested for PG and MPAA for a few careful observations, low violence (a bit of blood, although nothing else), inappropriate language, and others in cigarettes
