Dog Day is one of the most appropriate films I've seen to describe life in modern cities. It's very hard and cruel at some point and sadly it is very close to the truth. Separation, despair, emotional emotional, problematic, misleading, difficult, spiritual. All the objects that exist in today's major cities. It lets you reconsider the kind of compassion that people are leading the community. The worst part of life in the city has never been shown on the screen correctly. I just loved it. Unfortunately, it isn't. So ... 10/10.
