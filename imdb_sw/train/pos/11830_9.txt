This is an amazing movie seen with one thing made in only six or seven colors. When it happened over 15 years ago, it surprised the audience with its color scheme, to be completely different from anything else put on the film. These colors, for me at least, do this amazing film. There are literally thousands of events that I wished could freeze and somehow turn them into a painting of their drawings. <br /> <br /> The characters and stories are not the same as the size of photography, but all over-top, especially criminals. The most popular players who have played them here should be very happy when playing "Flatop," "Pruneface," "Lips," "Mumbles," etc. etc. Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are as good as Dick Tracey and Tess partner Truehart, and he is sweet and soft as his name. Another beautiful addition is Charlie Korsmo as a young boy of Dick and Tess who take under their wing. Other color characters play with Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but it's too much to list here. Check out the full credits on the main page and marvel. Only numbers obtained are Pacino's voice that gives you a short time, the voice of Madonna's voice and the fact that the film would have been better to load 10 minutes. In general, this is an enjoyable movie .... The cartoon of life-living cartoon in a wonderful way .... like something you have ever seen.
