In fact, it was cheesy and nonsensical and sometimes corny, but at least the film developers did not try. Although many television sets have reached the edge of the mediocrity, this film has certain features of redemption. The movie was good for TV film, and Viggo Mortensen shows Aragorn's shadows in the film about someone who played with his own rules. Much of the flashback series were kind of cheesy, but the area with the mountain lion was sharp. I was angry with Jason Priestly role in the film as a shock-jock-jock, but again, it's a MOVIE TV! Despite all the good things, the sound of the sound was angry. However, it was good to see Tucson, Arizona looked clear in the film.
