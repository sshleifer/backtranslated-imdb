Go to this film with a beautiful picture of Andy Goldsworthy, and prepare yourself for the opening and relaxing experience. Music fully completes the image, but never builds the attention itself. Other publishers said snippets of interviews with the artist are a weak spot, but consider this: why can you expand on this film, if you can read Andy's lessons for a long time in his books, or attend one of his best teaching? This is more useful to show the ephemeral condition of the artist's work, and is used in this way.
