Yes, it is wrong - especially if you have Hollywood movies that require a lot of harm, entertainment or fantasy or plot, and you can't really think. <br /> <br /> Roeg movies are for film-goer of mind, and Key is a perfect example. The identity is brilliant, the story is good, but, like all of Nic Roeg's films - you think of each level about the facts that will never come before. His films make you think, and self, I love it in the film. So don't try to come off and watch this movie and hear all the fun, because it is possible you will be able to crave. <br /> <br /> But I think it's best.
