I loved this movie. It is rare to find pictures of Vietnam, and this movie would fight off exciting bombs and guns-made it. I did not know that I would be greatly affected by that. It's amazing how you look for how Vets guest feel. It was hard to see, quite realistic. We all understand the battle with Apocalypse Now kind of drama, but this is very different. What happens when they return and try to live life? Can't. It made me very aware of a large group of men around and lost in the United States. I can't explain, can't sleep, can't have love things, can't cope with "normal society". They feel quite well. This is a great tragedy, and one that didn't think enough. Yes, we have changed our attitude towards Vietnam attractions, we love them now, but why? It does not seem that you have made any difference. Delayed? So it was a great film, but I cried a lot. I have no other complaints.
