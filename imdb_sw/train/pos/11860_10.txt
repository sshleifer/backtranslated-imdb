This movie has all. It is a typical example of events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino), is just one of thousands to get the opportunity to choose his destiny in America. This film's very straightforward and very realistic video of the Miamis Drugs is amazing. Brian DePalma is doing an amazing job that depicts this picture, so much so that the viewer cooperates with the whole story, with every character in cast. Since Tony's players are widely believed by the powerful, Brian DePalma giving the raw talent revealed by Steven Bauer (Manny, Best Friend Tony), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Dada Tony), Robert Loggia (Frank, Boss Tony) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed every minute watching this film, and still looking at each week. In this year, the 20th Feast of this tribal crime, I believe a faithful believer that over the next 20 years people will still watch this film in amazing numbers. Along with other crimes of crime, it is a shock to the system.
