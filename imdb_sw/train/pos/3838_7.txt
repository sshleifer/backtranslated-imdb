The fourth person (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983) <br /> <br /> The film derived from the novel by Gerard Reve, which makes it more effective as excited. That is quite surprising, based on the richest Reve requires one hundred pages of minor event and tension is the last thing in my mind when reading his work. <br /> "Fourth Man" is over-heavy on signals. Paul Verhoeven is generally concerned with confirming something to many hostile critics and I don't know what he is trying to prove. They usually despise his audience and tell him his story in such an unusual way, they quickly go from a natural idea or story, and almost seem to forget what is needed to see on the screen and what is needed left. In the "Fourth Man" he is not as clear about the details of the plot as he is with sex and deception (which there is a lot) but, as in his many films, it seems frightened viewers without getting to home hammer stories and more advanced signals and the illusion of horror and sex events. There is a difficult area without sex or complete deception, many of them very suddenly freeous and in your face, is undermining otherwise good news. However, when you are able to deal with the open Verhoeven clear approach, it is a recreational enjoyment of regular entertainment and a decrease of conspiracy and good performances, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© in particular. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
