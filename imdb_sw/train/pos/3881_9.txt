This movie has locked me with a series of amazing opening that has misled me in full view of the view, so I was scared at the head. The theme of this film is that everyone works, trying to introduce themselves, but not in such a difficult way as Identity or Ordinary characters, but in a way that we all try to make any banal life we ​​get for a little more interesting. Events in chicken warehouses are amazing. At one time Jorgen (who owns a chicken farm) attends a seminar with a laugh, where he is the worst student. Her discomfort in this lets you see the depth of her desire to change herself. The movie has made me wonder about the secret secret which is behind the face of most people I see every day. There are not many conspiracy here. Thinking the secret of an old man is very simple, but fantastic is a lie in trying to think all other characters will take what they see when they see it. This movie called me the same way that Sideways did, although the characters could not be more distinct.
