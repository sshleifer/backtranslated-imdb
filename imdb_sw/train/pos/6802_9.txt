You're good to see this section from the beginning, because if you start looking at it again, you will be frustrated as it happens to Clark's life. However, that's a perversion; Clark is stuck in reality. Lana is dedicated to him. Lex lost his many legs and he is in the wheel from the bridge crash when he missed the Clark in a series of trials. Martha is married to Lionel. About only once his faithful friend Chloe, who still believes who he is. And, oh, they don't have any authority. He is in a mental institution to put himself in a fantasy world where he has authority, and laughs to believe it. In addition to Chloe, there is a wonderful man who believes Clark: a black man who in reality is also hosting an institution, who believes he is from Mars. Clark should be true for everything he believes is the real reality, and not to get the brain of the brain and the institutional physician, who is actually the fourth escape of the Phantom area. This time is quite awesome and awesome. More, it provides a fresh twist from the most common type of "Smallville" episode.
