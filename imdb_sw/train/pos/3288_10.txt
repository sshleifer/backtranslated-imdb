This is a cool way of fantasy movie. One of my faves, in fact it's very cool. The director is Bernard Rose who continued to lead Candyman, started with the film. It is a picture of a girl named Anna who suffers from an epidemic of glandular birth. Every next dream is changed by the presence of anything he adds to the picture. In his third dream he meets the boy he thinks he has created what is called Mark. He has a friendship and their relationship becomes stronger as dreams become black and ugly. Charlotte Burke who plays Anna is a bright actor and it is so wonderful that, just one film, she should disappear and never be anything again. In fact it provides great performance in this film. Hans Zimmer's score is also an ace. Such as a broken arrow, music is ghostly and wonderful. It is a real shame that the sound of the voice is not available on CD again. The DVD is available only for R2.
