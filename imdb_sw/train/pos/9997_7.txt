The Stinks of Life (1991) was a step under another production of Mel Brooks. He becomes a star like a rich man who pays for his madness and his "friends". Brooks says he can live as a homeless person for a month. His worried friends are concerned with this unusual wager. During the "stay" in him in Bowery, he meets a group of homeless people, one of them finds his concept (Lesley-Ann Warren). They develop friendships as he teaches many of the techniques he learned while living on the street. Would Mr. Brooks live alone without the luxury of being so rich? Will he win this wrong salary? Who are his true friends? Get a look at the LIFE TRAINING to find out! This video is locked correctly. Certainly not as classic as its original films but it's still enjoyable. I loved how Mel Brooks honored Charles Chaplin in this film. If you have watched the original movie of the Chaplin then you will find humor too. It is recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
