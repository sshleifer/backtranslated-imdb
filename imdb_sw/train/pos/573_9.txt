I have been enjoying films that show life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily end up happy. "The river you use through" is the full name of this film (and Norman Maclean novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and has bad spots, but it's a wonderful journey. Robert Redford brings much to the film. His story has a friendly feeling of perfect image. As a director, he is restrained by calm, and finds the most beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt works amazing as well. I don't know how to describe Tom Skerritt's exhibitions and Brenda Blethyn, unless they really feel. "The river you use through" is a good film. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
