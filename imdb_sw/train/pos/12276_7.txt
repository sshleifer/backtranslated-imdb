What? Such natural production has failed its primary purpose, which had to change Allende's novel? Obviously yes. Bille August has been able to make an unknown film, an unknown film where the core elements of South America's ideas are presented only as side events, resulting in a total amount. I can't believe there is a whole team of producers that could not understand the book! There is certainly a technical quality in this film and I think participants did well with what they had in their hands, but something was wrong. And this was the most important part.
