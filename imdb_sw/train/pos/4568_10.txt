To a large extent, you can imagine the spread of the talent in one film without a great budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their prize: but it would certainly be sure they saw O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally Award: that is true here: they don't have responsibilities, they stay in them. Day-Lewis's performance is a powerful tour - a change that is terrible, but it was actually a mental scope of the Academy that with this performance, also honored the good work of preventing Brenda Fricker, still and of heart. like Christie's mother. By the way, if you haven't seen a very good actor in "Swann", that's another film worth looking out of her contribution (with Miranda Richardson good).
