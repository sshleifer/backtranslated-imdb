Well when watching this late film one night I was easily surprised by its greatness. Wonderful script, good acting, dress and special effects, and twists twists, wow! Certainly if you see the end coming you should be the author yourself. Great, I would like to recommend this film to anyone, especially if I don't know; t like them very much. <br /> <br /> Horror
