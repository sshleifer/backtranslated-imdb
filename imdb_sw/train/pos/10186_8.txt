Okay, I know this project of do'nt India for a good light. But all the themes of the movie are not India, it is Shakti. Power of the fighter, and the strength of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and her baby swallowed them in their heat. Then things go badly. The combination between Nandini and his father - the power of their unemployed relationship - and the changed life is the power of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to have come only as far as Karisma Kapoor's despair. It is easy to find on love, abuse and liberation of life in this film, and fun standing of forgiveness and sadness at the peak. The music interludes is powerful, believed and done well.
