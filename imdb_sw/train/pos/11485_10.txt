Zero day leads you to reflect, even to think about why two boys / young people would do what they did - commit suicide by killing their pupils. It takes what is supposed to be more than a strange way to that of two men who have decided to withdraw from ordinary citizenship to define their own / collective world through mutual destruction. It is not a full movie but was given money / how much time films and actors were - it's a wonderful product. By describing the purpose and actions of two suicides / murderers are better than 'Elephant' - since the film that gets under our 'rationalist' skirt is a far more film than anything possible to see. It is different but honest with dishonest honesty.
