HOLES are not your ordinary Disney things - it's very fun, even for adults who are busy with an interesting group, a "family entertainment" group that Uncle Walt's Studio goes through as a live point. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film is to his loyalty to the original book, which is a little darker than the kid's common items. The stage begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to the boys' camp, where all the prisoners are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a refreshing manner. But as the story goes on, Stanley's story deals with that of the legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes more fun ten times than any Disney movie about all prison camps has any right to be. Jon Voight is very beautiful and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is good, as always.
