"The myth of the century" was a half-hour series and appeared in the first time during the '54 -'55 'television period. It was also the first series of a winning Emmy TV award. Former West western player Dav Davis as a railway tracker Matt Clark, the series set up Clark and his rail track partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season with Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" during half The second) against the western historic disruption of various periods from the mid-1860s to early 1900s. The series was very satisfactory, easy to look, and indeed indeed due to the simple charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He seemed like a western character. Remember another. When Matt Clark would arrive in the city after a long journey he really looked like he was on a horse rider as he would be covered in dust. <br /> <br /> Very good early in the west.
