... but I enjoyed this show however. I have been reading some of the preliminary commentators had to say about this show, and having a very difficult time to overcome all the opposition in my head (except one: that show was stale; this program was nothing but stale). Many people talk about this show about money: engaging; forced; destruction; craving for caution; independently; speech to present forever. But you know what? I liked it very much. It was different, it was original, in fact, beaten; and that's designed for all minuses. The show was bright, verbal, quick, witty, interesting, fun to look ... you know, it was once a week, I could take once a week and expect it and enjoy it. I will mourn her passing. But I think no one will bring this life.
