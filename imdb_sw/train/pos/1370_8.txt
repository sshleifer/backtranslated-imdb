I remember seeing these years ago when it came out first and I was hit by the performance of Parker Posey. And the movie was good too. For anyone who spent too little time at night / after hours, this film will have a special charm for you. Not worse, more exciting, and Parker Posey definitely ignores his talented way through this indie gem. I really liked Diaz's behavior (he reminded me of every known DJ. And many other movies can be taken from this film about how to preach the beauty of responsibility without being boring and bland on it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> Babaganoosh!
