Damn, it was a lot of intervention. I was a huge amount that happened. It was very good, though I would say the editorial had a lot to do with it. I can't believe this man stayed with good words and many of them (Anton exactly) to get this whole picture without any beef .... Dandy came together, the middle children who used their benefits (and the same!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which probably wasn't what many other people felt. A large piece of film making is a good choice of subject. I recommend this to a music fan / film. You will probably learn something about film making.
