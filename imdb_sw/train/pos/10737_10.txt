If I didn't have a better understanding, it almost looked like it was done, but it wasn't. Founded fully, and how they got all the pictures are amazing! The bad events of September 11, 2001 are put together well in this documentary text and the classic which they got made this is a classic fortune. The only history in the footage alone should do so it must be seen by any American or someone touched by the tragedy of September 11.
