I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did amazing work! It's not just wonderful, but it's wonderful and wonderful body! He did a great job on the delivery of his lines, as well as being changed to George better than Fraser made. Good performance for its first great roll! This movie is full of hilarious events which each child will love. My children have watched this film many times since we bought a DVD on a day out. In addition to the film, extra on DVD is like hilarious. Two pieces on this! I strongly recommend everyone!
