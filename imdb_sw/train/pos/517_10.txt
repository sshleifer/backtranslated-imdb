Movieburger and Powell movie much more. David Niven runs a RAF striker who loses his own death but has been given a second chance in life when heaven realizes that he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The area where young soldiers, men and women, black and white, were all killed in practice, they come to heaven so that the use of eternal life is a bad one. See also Roger Livesey, a well-known player, and Kim Hunter as a love interest (later, of course, Zira in the Apes Planet). Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg struck an actor who played the archangel (Kathleen Byron) as an old wife of a private pastor in the Save Private Ryan years later, an act that speaks loudly for reading and learning movies.
