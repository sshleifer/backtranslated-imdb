An amazing and effective study of the "first killer" of the SSR in the US. Putting on this day of perestroika this great piece is brought to the full life and the show of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. This Cicatillo inquiry as a killer is rounded and by hinting some of his behavior while out of show others there is a trick that you push without having too many pictures. It is not for those who are weak of heart but if this is exciting but it is important for the full development of the main participants in this basic story. HBO has given us an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congrats to the director and editor of this large piece. It's in Top Top 10 You must see the list.
