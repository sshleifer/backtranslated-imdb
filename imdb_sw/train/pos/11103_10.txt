The "Godfather" of the television, but apart from the features and characters of the group, these two are not the same. Tony Soprano is forced to go to the psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. Her psychiatrist learns that Tony is part of two families - in one family he is a loving father yet not a perfect man, and in another family he is wise. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems come from his mother, Livia, who is suspected of having a border-man disease. Gandolfini is characterized as a great character; yet Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as recognized by their exhibition similar to talent as psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are worthy of their good responsibilities. Van Zandt (from E-Street Port) plays his first and exclusive role as Tony's best friend, and is very persuasive to prevent. Chianese, the only actor who had been seen on God's film, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed the characters organized by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "the same" but unknown (except the extraordinary performance of the Iler in the third period to the end, "Coming to Second"); Sirico and Schirripa are unacceptable and over-top, but the show has a very strong effect on them. Even if the show continues for more than six seasons, it is about to have a wrong or predictable time. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
