I just saw "Valentine" and I must say that it was the best movie that I have seen in years. Unlike the most recent trend of the frantic 90's, this film is more concerned and more powerful than self-denial. For those outside who hate them "Cry out," there is no record of "awesome rules" in this film (although the old slasher films are used here). This is a perfect mix of 80 and 90 screens. You get fashion, movies, and good actors of 90 films and a slasher flick of 80's. The kind of movies they wanted. This is certainly a move in the right direction. Denise Richards stands here as a happy character. You can tell him he loved his role, and that makes him stand. I loved him in this film.
