I had an abstract idea of ​​who Bettie Page was, partly because of her appearance in many days of Playboy (apparently, when she got a picture of her and Santa's hat, so, she didn't know what weeds were). The movie, written and directed by Mary Harron's American Psycho, eliminates important parts of her life enough. Belle south of the church goer has a bad experience and leave them behind to find the best time in New York City, where she gets modeling, and from there much more. Recently, he becomes a subordinate feeling, and a clear bondage (and "bad reputation" of the name) attributed to him. Gretchen Moll shows him, and finds the woman's spirit as well as he can, which is really a successful film. He is not a simple character, even if sometimes his moral sense is of course (“well, Adam and Eve were naked, isn't it?” He says several times). Apparently, the authors of the film leave the life of the future and leave him with a kind of redemption period, leaving behind the pictures of Jesus. All of them, Bettie's page doesn't have much more than a typical bio-pic type presented by HBO films, although this time with the power of the film release. The best features Harron takes are a page in its "interrogated" positions, getting its images in the top and top and films worn-out screens and leather uniforms. This adds comic aid needed for the original nature of the film. It is not that the story behind him was not interesting, which involves the government's investigation into the 'smut' that came out of those pictures and underground newspapers. But there is not much time available to explore more than just what is known, and the Page and its problems or relationships or sex with fifty. All have been presented with a black and white look and white and sometimes it seemed as Harron had been developing some black and white pictures so that it had more color as it went. It's a view to watch if you don't have too much knowledge of Bette Page, and maybe for fans too.
