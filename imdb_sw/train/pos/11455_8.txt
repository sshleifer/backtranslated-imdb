This German letter, in English, refers to the Scottish landscape artist Andy Goldsworthy. He does art from the things he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film we see him taking part of the icicles and "touch" with a little moisture in the shape of a snake that appears to repeat through the vertical rock. In fact, the icicles rotate, but that walk is part of many of Goldsworthy jobs. He goes to the site and gets a feeling for him, deciding intuitively what to do on that day. He talks to have "talk" with stones and other materials that he uses and try to try * and * rather than resist. It can be stones, or flowers, or leaves, or sticks. Sculpture can last for a minute or years, or it may even last long enough to complete and photograph. The task seems to be more process than intended. <br /> <br /> Movies, and work, are good, stimulating, and stimulating. It goes slowly, which fits the material, but you should be sure to go when you fall asleep at night. But go if you have a chance. Find web site for other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about its internal sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available for pictures of his images. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Skip to read this section if you want to find what this film means to you personally. I remember several thoughts that happened to me as I watched the film that I thought I would share with those who are still reading. First, the short-term nature of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded the work of nature and the flow of human life. We are born, live, and finally die. That's normal, and that's also part of Goldsworthy's art. Another view would be surprising in the way that Goldsworthy has been able to connect his passion to his work in his life. Most of us have a work that is well tolerated, a life that we cannot recognize alive, and what we mean to spend more time, if we remember what it is. Andy Goldsworthy has been able to create all of these aspects of his life that seems to be working very well, and it is well suited for him and those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Appear on 8/28/2002.
