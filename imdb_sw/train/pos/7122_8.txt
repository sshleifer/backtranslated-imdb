In the second post-World War II, a voice in Hollywood attempted to withdraw from an unconscious banner that is a natural link to the war effort. "The Best Years of Our Life" and even the "Gentleman Agreement" passed through the Americans who watched themselves after the war, but Delmer Daves "" Pride of Marines "beat them. <br /> <br /> Movies are about Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield who goes to war as the sea and after evening night, with Japanese soldiers crying for him and his friends "Mariiines, tonight will die!" blind and hand-grenade, and sing his partner at home instead of relying on her after returning home. Delmer Daves is the opposite of its manifestation on these people who have the courage, as it was, almost unfortunately they were there, in the shade, and when they were shot, they witnessed. For a lot of courage, but they get that job and then come and sympathy, darkness, a bad feeling of humor.Garfield is in rejecting the anger of his blindness and the film is not recommended excuse, "There is no free candy for anyone in this world", as his friend tells him. sitting, a Jew, played with Dane Clark, reminds him, "In war man finds, and you are. Everyone has trouble! When I come back, some boys don't hire me, because my name is Diamond". Great films are made by these guts, and if the first half of 'Marini' attraction fails to increase in the event completely, since then it is becoming a true work of art. you ask and you have hope for hope. <br /> <br />
