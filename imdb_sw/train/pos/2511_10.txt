I went to search for this film in the brutal fan of a common fan. I just liked to look out. I didn't expect anything. After all, the musician, actress and screen writer? It is impossible for many talents to live in one person. ?? Do not! Forget aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The story line and the characters are not lost for the most commonly affected effects of Hollywood. Story breaks your feelings and draws you. As a link linked to, you realize that you are closed to the end. Sometimes, acting seems slightly up. I, however, believe that it has been done with the comedic intentions and very suitable for character. Otherwise, I could not expect the level of attendance. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing or waiting unexpectedly about something I have missed or I forgot about the first or two times around. I really recommend this film. Feel free to get in with your concerns, but I'm sure it will find a place on your shelf.
