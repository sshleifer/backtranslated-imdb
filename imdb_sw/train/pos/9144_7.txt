Ok, so it can be a movie "movie of the year" (except a brilliant sound that I think it won a small prize), but it's a very good film about 'Kid' (Prince / O (make your pick) and surrounding events. Minneapolis, playing his music. Music is very good, in my opinion you should own this sound of sound, it's realistic and approaching the voice of eight and feel in good style. And the movie itself creates a good plot, it is important to see regularly again, basically if you would like Prince / O (which I am).
