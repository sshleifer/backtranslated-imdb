I think this movie was a good reason. It is amazing that the twins of Olsen are now 13 and both sons and all. I was very happy when they were little children in the Full House. However, the cast was good and the movie was sad. I have had a mix of all areas of switch and their names. It's just the kind of old version of the Next Line.
