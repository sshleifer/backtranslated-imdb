The British aircraft, George Taylor (who showed strong and Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by robbers after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with blood and little Dr Emy Wong (good and beautiful performance of Tea Tea). George returns his health and returns to work. Emy fails to hear from George for a long time, he loses despair and become a prostitute. While the director / co-author Bitto Albertini actually provides a reasonable amount of expected dirt and natural rainfall, this film is nothing but your normal lobby routine. Rather it's amazing surprising, touching and sad story story between two well-drawn and very interesting characters (Tea as Emy Wong is particularly radiant and pleasant). The picture begins out of sound and fun, but the tone swaps for the worst and worst form of two-thirds of the way. The birth of Emy in the opposite after assuming that the lie that George had left him is bright and upsetting; He said a sad and surprising surprise to finish. In fact, the story is true, but it is never very good. Additionally, sex events are delicious and even realistic. The famous Italian star Ilona Staller has a good part to complement part as George's envious and unacceptable secretary Helen Miller. The Guido Mancori Style of Polished offers many wonderful shots of foreign sites. Fidenco's Nico Fidenco's funky, throbbing blows the groovy spot. It should look for those looking for something different.
