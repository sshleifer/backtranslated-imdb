You have always acknowledged that Representation of Fear was greatly affected by the part of Kolchak. They have been, they, will be, if this makes it a deficit or reverence is a more controversial stage. As a great fan of all the series I join the last belief, although less charitable can not do. James Whitmore had the courage to take on the task of leading the difficult part, the invisible elephant and gorilla suits look like a catastrophe, but he removes it in a fashion, teaser being a gem. Lance Guest is doing a good job to make reliable behavior from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader risky as Ed Meecham. Forget the origin of an Awesome Creature and enjoy it as a simple X file.
