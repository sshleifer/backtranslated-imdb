Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans (more than all the Boomers' children who were at the end of the 50 and 60 years), three actors / adult actors seemed when they did for the show again, in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly later. As enjoyable as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe, and Pepino together, it was very strange about the absolute absence of any of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? It is my understanding that little Luke was dead in 1999, but I don't know how. There is no news about Hassie on the Internet, that I can find. Very curious why not even named? It was very clear, their absence from the Reunion show, that I think that Michael and Lydia's family (if still alive), 1) asked to leave out of the discussion and therefore their desire was given, or 2) TNN could not get any information of Michael or Lydia (as we others), seemed to be lost. Therefore, it would be a more secure policy to leave them out of all conversations. Otherwise, the result of Walter Brennen was made strange. They did not make skeletons on it ... is a Mrs. who made the show to be successful. I remember, as a child, trying to walk to Gogo and my parents laughing (if I'm sure other million children did at that time). One failure that bothered me a bit, was the behavior of Richard Crenna to control the discussion ... sometimes to stop Tony and Kathleen to do something. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed to be able to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to talk and speak too much during the Reunion show. Of course, since I wanted to hear from all three, right. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I have watched it on a DVD several times and I have always enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
