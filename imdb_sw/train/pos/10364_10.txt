Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have accepted only a little girl, Azaria. As the Seventh-day Adventists, they live their faith every day and soon Azaria dedicated to God their church, and their two older boys are watching. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to lead on Rock Ayer, one of the most tourist advertising in Australia. Not being rich, family camps near the site. After the first wonderful day, Lindy puts the baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tent. Suddenly, he hears Azaria crying. If Lindy rushed to the tent, the dingo dog is only leaving, shaking her head. The child has gone and soon, so it's dingo. Although the whole camp appears to the child, it is not available. Concluding his death and that the dingo is made by their beloved child, Chamberlains are struggling to accept God's decision and continue their lives. But, unfortunately, the story finds an animation coverage in the media and the story is recently broadcast that Lindy was killed by the child. He finally was arrested and sentenced. How can this happen? This is a great example of the real events that show how "rule of the people" is not the idea of ​​thought. The whole country returns to Chamberlains, partly because it looks strange. Streep offers its best performance as Lindy complex, whose powerful conduct works against him every step of the way. Neill, likewise, does a good job as a surprise and frustration Michael. Sent is one of the largest, and pictures of people around the world find their digs in Lindy's case. Clothing, landscape, script, leadership and production are all over the line. If you have never seen or heard this film, the compensation immediately. It is not a great cry from the fact that this "cry" should be seen by all concerned about the film and about the improper pressures of the media.
