Manning Man is not a great movie, in fact it's kinda silly. But it offers what you want on the movie Arnie and that's the action and entertainment. I don't see how anyone who can't enjoy this picture, it's so quiet and up, that almost enjoys itself. By the way, this is probably one of the most popular movies of Arnie out there.
