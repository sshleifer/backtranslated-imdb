I have seen this small children's entertainment movie that is actually considered more by adults with a lot of joke and humor that they could understand. Few things do not benefit children, but only a few. Of course, "Grinch" (Jim Carrey) breaks down many jokes that you can't keep with them all, from sex to culture into Hollywood to color. <br /> <br /> The movie is a color color and seems to be popular on DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is very nice and the hair of the young people here is happy to see. Anthony Hopkins's voice is also interesting, so with this description it raises more movies. Her bodies are happy to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the theater, though it was "right," but on DVD, it was better. I have seen three times and it was always better.
