Good movies! Decreases: Yes. <br /> <br /> ... but first, bright, dark and awesome, SURREAL completely (feels like a dream) <br /> <br /> I would like to compare with David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style perhaps with a mix with a bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (insects!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add another night to the world, Angel Heart and a bit of birth, Pi, (it would be okay to mention Tetsuo?) James's taste, Barker's Forbidden and Salome - which should form together at least the concept of the dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you have gone for avantegard / surrealistic movies (if I am) you are like this. If you are expecting anything else like a full act of action and a certain plot - try your luck and something else. The last words: the plot is very strange and unusual and maybe it's # 1 the reason why most people who do not appreciate this film are interested in it.
