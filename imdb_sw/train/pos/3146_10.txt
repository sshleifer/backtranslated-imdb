If the television was a baseball league, this show would have a full record! With a good cast, and a full plot, this show provided 8 awesome seasons and great fun for TV after dinner. With the constant change of relationships and finding whom the real father of Hyde is, this show was hit when it started on August 98, although it was founded in 1976. And hanging out of the Basement of Foremans was something to do at that time, and is still today, with circles.This gave a great laughter in premieres, and still makes it time to run again. If you watch a few events of this show, you will find everything and want to get more. Now this only shows one of the best, created and intelligent.
