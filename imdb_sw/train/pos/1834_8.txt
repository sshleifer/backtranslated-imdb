This is a very touching movie. I don't care what people say about this film, this is a very good movie. Amitabh Bachchan's role and father has a dead father is great, because he wants to teach his son how to deal with life if something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was in his position as Aditya Thakur was destroyed. The responsibility of helping Shefali Shetty who played the role of Sumitra Thakur was very great. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as a brain-dead slave and Boman Irani as father-in-law has a very good relationship with the comedy song they had hilarious. The direction is very good.
