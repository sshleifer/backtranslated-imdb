Don't listen to duddy critics on this, this is gem! Rich young man Joan and his brother find themselves dead after their father died - and now they should work for survival! He, usually, becomes a writer, and he, as usual, a group driver! For the events of wild cooperation their work meets the head, thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. At the same time there is an opportunity to undergo a swimmer to swim to a group of good things and to Joan make two numbers of dangerous dances (for all the steam of the steam scarf). But nothing should be taken seriously - it's all good fun from those wonderful days before the code, when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan seems to be good, and she shows a lot of many emotional emotions that can give her work for a long time (thank God for stopping playing!). Gable is fantastic as a slimy gangster - was not a star yet and so did not become a hero. Great to see him playing something different. And William Bakewell is as good as a poor confused brother. And there are some good plans and tracking shots for director Harry Beaumont, who stimulates a piece at the speed of the skin - and constantly wink to the audience! Great fun!
