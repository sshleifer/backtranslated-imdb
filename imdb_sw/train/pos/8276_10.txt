Now this is what I'm talking about. Ultimately, the threat of a small budget that uses its use for its benefit. WENDIGO, sometimes by mistake, is a victory of thought. In fact, it is heavier on the EVIL DEAD camera measures, but it still looks better than 99% direct to video output. The story is very simple: the family takes a vacation on a rural cabin and is threatened by one unfortunate hunter. But director Larry Fessenden knows how to create excitement and add enough layers to renew through the use of historic Wendigo. What? It's true? Is it all in the boy's mind? What is the externalization of the emotional state of the child? Others have insisted that the film is not suitable because it is left to you to decide. Do not be removed by small nonsense. The film that makes you think is not one of avoiding. It's one to enjoy.
