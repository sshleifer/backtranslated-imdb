One of the most exotic films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The little girl is amazing talent. Stellar and its exhibition (Doggie), an old man (king of masks), and Liang (Boddhisatva Hai). (SPOILER) Poor treatment of children, especially women are concerned. <Br /> <br /> Liked music. The Chinese negotiations initially increase the emotional power of the exhibition and story. This is a SHURI - A happy family, though not very young children. It would have been rated to release the DVD even if the voice sound was transferred to the DVD and the transfer included a regular version.
