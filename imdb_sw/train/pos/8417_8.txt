When this film style is not as understated and true as voice sounds perhaps would, this is still a very good film. In fact, it was seen as the best film in its day, as selected by the Best Picture Oscar First (losing for WINGS). I still feel that WINGS have an excellent film, but this is better despite a bit of frustration and leading, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is the largest Russian Russian who lives in the last days to make a few bucks in the 1920s to be an extra Hollywood. His fortune seems to have changed if he gets a phone - he is playing the Russian war in general against the Communists during the revolution. Usually this is not a lot of prudent spread, but it also finds an old man to think about the past and the revolution. Exactly what happens next will leave them, but it's a good film - especially the end. By the way, see William Powell as the Russian director. Despite being made in 1928, the shapes will not seem to be much smaller than they did in many future films.
