This was hit in the South West and South West Festival (SXSW) in Austin yesterday, and it included a fine led by the Gloria Reuben of E.R., and John Glover's view. Although beaten on a small budget in NYC, the film looks and looks amazing, and it takes us back to the scream whirl through the exercises and mounting of call operators "The Scottish Play," as a reference to the word "Macbeth" is to think of bringing in the old curse. play. The acting company shows all the feelings of playing itself, passion, envy, anger, doubts, and some fun as well. Games begin when the accomplished actor changes (in the role of the lead) and the “good face” known from the TV soap surfaces to draw a large crowd. Monster of green eyes takes from there, and this game opens well. Good sound, and beautiful performances around. The DVD includes the definition of director and other deleted events as well.
