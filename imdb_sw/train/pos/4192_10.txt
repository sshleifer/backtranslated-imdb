In what is probably found in my list of the best Fuller movies (ie, once I see more than just a shock diagram), Pickup on South Street is a film album where a woman fatale, along with a male, not stereotypical that kind. Like most of his other works, Fuller tries his own experience and the sense of New York style which is often not on the night of Hollywood. In a small budget - at least for Darryl F. Zanuck- Fuller and its actors create people who seem to be even in such a dark condition. Good men are those who will not be violent to you even if they are looking for an extra buck. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all strong in leading areas. Widmark is just a few players I can think of who could really pull this habit. He is a bit like Bugs Bunny, for he can be a wise ass who is a little slick. On the other hand, Skip McCoy's character has a set of values ​​in his life. He does not go into other people's affairs, and does not try and care about a lot of the world of work outside his little shadow on the river, after being sent for three years. He stands, unknowingly, when he cuts the woman (Peters) on the train, and raises something under the Government's eye. It may have some secrets that can make him a lot of money. But at what cost is the film center, since it involves Stoolie Moe (Ritter is one of the most excellent artists, and most trusted, characters from that period), former woman (Kiley bright), and police department. br>> <br /> Apart from ethical issues, which are told in a very good way, the journalistic style (as it was Fuller's position, as well as striker), the discussion is clean and engaging. There is a preference in a lot of camera action Fuller. And the third act. This is a lean, thin film that is suitable to watch even if you don't know with Fuller (it's more wonderful than some of its future work).
