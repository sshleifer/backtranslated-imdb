I saw this in Detroit in what was running earlier. I joined the playground. It was funny. I haven't seen it since, but I would like. Where do you get a copy? Anyone saying anything about it being dated or overdone is, for my money, just a group of poseurs. Each skit is either evil, heavy or wrong. Every one! Not even a weak one included. The opening of the opening, for example, which takes place in 2001, has a gorilla go-go and a pendulous breast. Felinni would have shown that he was a bad guy ... If you come to this film with an open mind and bltly sneering, you will have a pencil on your best list.
