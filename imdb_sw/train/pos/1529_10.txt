Diagnosis Kill is one of the only programs I look at on TV now. The way all actors have something to do in each case makes it different from presentations where they consider 1 or 2 people per section and everyone is beaten on the side. The brain function is also obvious that you do not know exactly what he thinks, and if you think you are doing, you are missing. The diagnosis of the killings has included various topics, not just in case but in each other's personal life. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. Is it for people of the past? Nina 24 !! I don't think I can be old yet. I just want to know when they will be opening all the DVDs (not NTSC) so that I will look at them all in order. They seem to be doing so with many other plans from the same time so they can accelerate!
