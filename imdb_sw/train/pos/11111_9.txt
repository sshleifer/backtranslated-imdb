Sopranos is perhaps a series of opening mind that you might want to watch. It's smart, it's amazing, it's funny - and carries a variety of mafia well that many people can't resist the look. The best feature of this show is the great effectiveness of the characters, placed in the lower world of New York crime families. Often, you don't know whether wise people will hit someone back, or buy lunch. More to add the actual way of the characters in this show is the depth of their self - these are dangerous people, most of them are killers, but with God if you don't like them too. I have cut their desires, broken when they came out of the judgment, and were afraid of a massive crime crime. The township of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this show's subtext - people are not always as they seem, and the absolute difference between humdrum and action taken by these criminals seem to be small until even the odds. If you have never, you certainly should.
