The Five Venly Venoms is a great movie of kung-fu action locked in the mystery of whodunnit. There are all common flick of kung-fu fits: big voting, bad pictures, "different styles" fighting, and different types of fighting, often feel human feelings. However the plot is better than average. It is interesting and focuses on all your ideas in the fighting stations. It is often the ability to ignite the audience, such as the behavior of the X receives the unpleasant effects. Something else that I like about Venoms Five Death is a good humility of the moral and the film's theme. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. Fear, greed, and corruption loses. The wicked, used by selfish desires, are eventually destroyed by their own lies and behind them. Good men use team work, planning, and completeness to overcome the bad situation and come out. <br /> <br /> Evil family descent!
