"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best music at all, but it's great fun, and available to many viewers. The original film would be amazing, and Dick Van Dyke signed Broadway's role, but instead interacted with the plot, so the film is not suitable. This has renewed, which has been revealed in the ABC in 1995, is widely believed in the original script, and includes the original songs that were used on a national tour that this film removed which Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking were captured by stars (who chose this film). Jason Alexander is a very different kind from Dick Van Dyke, but he is beaten well as Albert, (before his "Seinfeld" days, began in the theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. They are also a good job from Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (the role he played in a national tour). This video is not a problem yet. The biggest responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, however, is fascinating, looks just and seems to be a very old boy Kim. And George Wendt is bland as his father, giving a number of "children" away (the original member of Paul Paul Paul's stolen a show and.) But for all, this is a beautiful, well-made film which material was deserved.
