Spirit trains are a treat for those who enjoy the 1940s. Askey, playing the role of Tommy Gander, is the one that focuses on the stories in which they can be shown as stimulating or "entertaining". <br /> <br /> The story of the haunted station is actually spoon even to the present day rates. It is unique and how the characters communicate with each other is wonderful to keep secret which is the Train of the Spirit. Gander is essentially for all other members when others meet properly. He is always a cautious center and can be called as "being angry" but that's for those who do not enjoy the 1940 humor. If it was not for Askey / Gander, than this film would be short, practical and results would not be effective in my opinion.
