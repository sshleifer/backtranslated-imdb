A hot offender is murdered by a suspect of murder and then covers a crime, but he must have a guilty conscience while trying to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney have been reunited with the Preminger director in the film film that fits as "Laura," their original cooperation. Andrews is fully beaten as a good soldier, a good man who has had a bad situation. Acting is good round, including Malden as a tough captain of the police and Tully as the father of Tierney's immunity. Screenplay and Hecht, a good and bright writer, is taut and suspenseful, and Preminger builds a beautiful atmosphere.
