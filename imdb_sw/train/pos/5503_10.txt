The material in this document is so powerful that it brought me tears. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of the number of commonly used people should encourage all of us to stand up for our rights, to do better for the community and to stop making excuses for not being a challenge. Chavez represents those who are weak and lucky in the same way. Bush is the face of non-profit organizations and humanity ran away from the amok. In fact, South America is taken again and the vast majority of lost people finally have a voice in over five centuries. Although, in Mexico's case, the election was changed by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, away from it. He tries to change the constitution to allow him to judge forever. That cannot be tolerated. It is enough for politics to return to the film; Steps are breathing taking time, and a deep philosophy to others. It shows Chavez as a famous hero not afraid of the challenge of the hegemony of the United States and the management of world resources. If you think the author is interested in Chavez, nothing stops you from doing your homework. One important film message is to ask the sources of information, as clearly indicated by the tragedy of the snippers for shy deception to Chavez supporters. Venezuela puts US democracy claims to be shy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
