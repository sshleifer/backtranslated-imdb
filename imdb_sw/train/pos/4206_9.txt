Skip McCoy is a three-fold pocket of refusal, can not prevent its nature behind the road, taking the candy bag on the subway. What he does not know is that Candy has a small secret microfilm, microfilm which is of great interest to many many organizations. Director Samuel Fuller has made a unique game set among the seeds under the New York City. Communist sponsors and alliance of shady governments combine together to make Pickup On South Street look riveting from the first minute to the end. According to the story of Dwight Taylor, Blaze Of Glory, Fuller was attracted to this change with a strong political agenda, something most people have felt, but only considering its anti-communist protection is a great freedom. <Br /> <br /> Dig a little more and get the characters as amazing as any that Fuller spells, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, crook and inferior human, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they is born out of his stubborn streak. It is a great achievement that Fuller has made one of the best 50-year-old heroes, and I am sure he was very grateful for the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all kind of cold and cool winter, and cooperating with him with Jean Peters as wonderful as Pipi , and it's the heart of the film. However, it is Osl elected Thelma Ritter who takes the prestigious position, his Moe is as strong and as a seed as the closest actors, but there is a fatigue for Ritter which shows a great deal. It is a B movie in texture but the film in action, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertainment film which is the best of its most attractive director. 9/10
