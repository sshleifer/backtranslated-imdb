This film was quite brilliant. It really makes me think. During the entire movie I was confused as hell. I liked everything about it ... it was just so confused and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love it. Both characters were phenominal, and no one could do a good job ... This is one of my favorite year ... it deserves ocar.
