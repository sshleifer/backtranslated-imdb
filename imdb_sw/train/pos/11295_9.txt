This movie has always been my favorite since the first sight as a child of 12 years in 1962 when it was shown in the "Los Angeles show" television station. The characters are very concerned with the beginning of the image, and it is so bad that the film has not been given to the video tape, nor has it been shown on television (apparently because of restrictions on Moss Hart House, player / producer / director who wrote the story and first put it on at New York stage during WWII - the reason for refusing to show it is difficult to understand over 50 years after it was made). I never saw the film for more than 30 years, when a person who was actually a great member of the movie got me a copy of "bootlegged" on VHS (a limited video quality, but good sound). My memory was correct: it was still a lively and interesting movie. The amazing feature of this film is how many of its stars, just started in their work during 1944), continued to be the biggest stars of motion photos or at least known and famous actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain , Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy, and Gary Merrill). The exhibition and the B-24's are the most awesome, especially the nearby shots where the giant notes (at the time) 4-engine bomb (then 18,000+ manufactured, now almost close) can be seen. A good understanding of the different levels of training that the experimental debate went through its given way to bombers (of course, the gender VERY as was the trend of the day: Only men appeared pilots, women only helped them in their roles - unacceptable in the world of today). I hope one day will be released on the video for a new generation of enjoyment.
