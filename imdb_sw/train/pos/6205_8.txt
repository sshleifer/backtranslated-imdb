Facing, anger and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to stay but Parker Posey is the only actor who can take this story and run it. He touches once, likes, is cunning. Supporting staff do the same. I even try to tell you a plot. It involves characters from Henry Fool's Hartley and tries to tell the story of international wind. The film works best if you go with it - understand it. for, quite worried. It becomes more and more ridiculous if you plod together. (I denied the attempt to turn off the DVD twice). Fay Grim requires a film attraction that emerges to deal with something that is not a cookie basket. At the end, it provides something that does not contain information.
