I believe Sarafina is a great effort to Whoopi Goldberg. In addition to him, no other stars in the film and his role is smaller than the title of the title, Sarafina. Since I work in secondary school and urban children, I think this is an important film to show South Africa's history of racism. Sarafina is a movie about education and the teacher's relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for anything on the videostore. I looked at it and soon I used music numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and students to understand. Now when I do not know other actors and actors of the film, I think they are well-known in South Africa and I am happy to have played with South African delegates and staff except Goldberg for a small role but if it makes people see this film, rather than Whoopi gets to appeal worldwide.
