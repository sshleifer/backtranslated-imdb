Little by little boundaries of bad taste; but mind enough to deserve a look. Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is linked to a reluctant guardian, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist that daylight running for humans. He builds a plane in his garage and hopes to fly. He wants to raise his troubled life by caring for Jane, who has trouble with neurological disorders that all stand up with very little motor skills. Decay-wheel and filled with spirit, its end die want is to open its daughter. He gives himself to Richard, who cannot help him directly; but it is ready to steal the bank to pay gigolo to act. I have seen this powerful and interesting flick. Even in this position, Carter has a certain charisma and beauty.
