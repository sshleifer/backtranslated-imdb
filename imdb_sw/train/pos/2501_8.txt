I am a fan of all participants / singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer, I think this is just stupid. In the long after waiting, I looked last and here is my opinion ... I find that everyone knows the story of the story and not mentioning it, instead of blowing my first hand takes action, usually Japanese films are not brilliant and they make it. with its positive changes, I would like many wonderful and interesting pictures, such as the HYDE section, its acting is good but deliberately sits in history as an actor, respectively as its character makes, in all movies. I did not have some lighting lights and other lights but because of a small budget, it still has a good time, but the real film of the film is a story. The touch sometimes, on the other hand the story of a world of cruelty which none of those pointing to some amazing life scenes shows this theme for the picture. (not a good, beautiful) of America's movies, in fact the Child of the Moon somehow might seem like a brother and Interwiew, but it was originally his own. I was doing this but not changing the MoonChild has bad events or characters. All in all, this movie is very good and emotional sometimes, like for waig duo / duo singers I hope to see their other movies in the future, and I recommend this to everyone who likes film-fiction and romance 8/10 movies
