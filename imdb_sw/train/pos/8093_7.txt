My friend had the idea of ​​looking at the LOTR animated after seeing Peter Jackson's King's return. So I finally bought it on the e-bay, thinking that since the beginning it was drinking. True, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for its time, they used a special way to combine live action and animation to affect some interesting effects, and the person who made a sound to Frodo sounded as much as Elijah Wood. It's not a big change of book, but you believe me, I have seen a lot more. It jumps over many items, since all the Partnership and the two Towers are emphasized in one movie two hours. Definatley worth an hour, children can love, but still, absoutley does not match the trilogy of Peter Jackson.
