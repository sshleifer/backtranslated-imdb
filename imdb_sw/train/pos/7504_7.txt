Hey guys I'm in this film! I didn't even know that on this site until I watched a few years ago and I was surprised! I played Pete, son characters. It was a great experience and I loved her every minute. During the movies they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my sister twin as a double body! The finger that triggers the radio button in the car is not mine. I still do and do some TV, but not so much. Olo and want proof my name is the first on the book. Review: I thought the movie was the same but if I didn't, it can't be one of my favorites. I thought the acting was very good, but the story line was just that.
