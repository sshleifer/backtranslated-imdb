Awesome, spiritual revival on the restoration of the Gospel. Far better than any film, or film made on restoration until now. If you haven't seen it, send a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You can't regret it! In fact you have the meaning of what the first saints had to fight through, putting full faith and confidence in the Prophet Joseph Smith. You will eventually find a kind of understanding of things that the prophet had to fight and through the suffering he and his people faced. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our beginnings of humility just look at this film, it will make a full and complete feeling later.
