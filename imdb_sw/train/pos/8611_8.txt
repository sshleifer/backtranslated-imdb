I was very happy to see this film. I have set it in the watch so I can look at it later. I really enjoyed seeing two more since I was able to get more of a clever conversation between Natalie and Adam, 2 main characters. I thought how this story was altered was very stimulating thinking. I was so interested in how Natalie would communicate with her daughters' friends, at first it seemed to be worthy of a lot of hatred but as soon as she began to interact with more joy I had to see how this journey happened. I had no desire. Step by step stages that Sara kept from her mother began to reveal a young woman who was not perfect, as many of us who wanted her independence from an authoritative mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately she had to learn a very painful way that sometimes really loves someone gives them their freedom. The viewers who held this film to the end saw the most touching performance from Diane Keaton (who is always extraordinary, even in some of her well-thought movies and Towns). Diane Keaton's fast-moving section was worth waiting, revealing that anyone who loves another person needs to learn that we should live our own lives, we love others but not ourselves and ultimately we should let go. It's a hard lesson but it's good to contemplate now and then.Thank CBS for these ads, it was worth waiting for a long time.
