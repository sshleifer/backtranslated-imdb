Therefore, that gave the Law the opportunity to drive Curveberg Curve and its Plymouth cruiser. For example, the beginning of the film, two pilgrims during departure are trying to return to the base when they are moved away from their deaths, if I remember correctly. Then one day, the visitor drove the city. It is probably the most cool of the fire in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, as in McKord gaskets. In the possibility of the end of the fire. Black fire burning '34 Ford coupe. The color of death, evil and hell fire. He takes the speed of the sheriff for the purpose. He seeks out of the ground. She is a brother of one of the victims of the sheriff. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government fits for the sheriff. There is only one way to get justice for the murder of his brother and fix these things "this will never happen again to anyone": restoring the expulsion and solving the fire-rodder style contest for death. He goes to the curve and practices. Sheriff knows McCord knows. Race begins ... This is a movie that must be remembered by anyone who has tried to drive maneuvers in a certain way.
