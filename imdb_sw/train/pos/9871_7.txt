The return of the lost world was held back and returned to the 1992 edition of the world lost. In this regard, the same five people, led by Challenger to return to the ice where the group has started digging for oil that threatens to damage the land. Gomez has something to do with this. They can defeat monitors and dishes are safe, very happy for the locals. Like in the lost world, how many dinosaurs will we have made with the ball and these include T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner controls their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three other actors also return. Even with many negative views of this and those of the cheapest football dinosaurs, I enjoyed returning to the lost world. Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
