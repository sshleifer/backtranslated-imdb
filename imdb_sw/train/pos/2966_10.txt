BASEketball is awesome! It's a hilarious and so damned funny that you wet your pants laughing. I have seen many times I have stopped counting. But every time it gets funnier. <br /> <br /> I believe on this one ... BASEketball is a real hitfire and I loved it and will continue to love it. I hope one day there will be a special edition of DVD released !!! !!! Thumbs Ten Up !!!
