I bought this film on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night. I have been a fan of Tolkien's work for 4 years now, since I was in school. I didn't grow in this film ... maybe my mother put me away. It's definitely not for kids. It is not that it is bad in the sense of the model, but the theme will go well on the age of 10 years. I thought the story would follow this book well enough. But I am disappointed that Bashki did not add another 40 minutes or so to deal with parts of the King's Return. That would have made it the last film. I was worried by the sudden end, and then I heard the return of King Return, I had more trouble. Not bad was not one film animation. It may have received lots of votes from me. 7. I can only hope that Jackson Jackson will make the right books and a new live LOTR.
