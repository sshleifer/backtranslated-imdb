I was able to watch this film in general and be transferred to detail with it. I did not know whether it was a comedy or a real drama - it had both elements. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked amazing - our photo of 60-year-old women has been changed since Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only restrictions on this film are that it did not mention exactly the other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows since the 1970s. and her sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would come, thinking she was still in the Big Apple. It is my hope that ABC will do this in a row and return to the appearance of visitors to all the exhibitions of the past. By the way, what was caused by CBS to make this reconciliation, or the last series? Isn't that the web carrier "MTM" and "Rhoda" shows?
