I see what my father saw in Bette Davis's boy. He is a princess in this close-madcap political comedy which actually star Warren Williams as a political corporation always back on his alimony. Vivienne Osborne is as brilliant as his former, and I found myself a root for him. Williams's character is not completely sympathetic, and he doesn't even have good. Guy Kibbee is one of the best in what he does. As a candidate motivated out of sleep in the political story and was elected head of government to prevent the contestant candidate from nomination, so all this confusion comes from the political struggle of internecine in the so-called "Development Association." If you are politically motivated, you will probably see another party except what you are doing with the “Development Association” of Williams and Kibbee. I could be the same, but we're not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those who love these old comedies. If you have ever looked at any old Wheeler & Woolsey names (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, RAINMAKERS), you will find Frank McHugh, like the right hand of Williams, watching and doing a lot like Bert Wheeler. He reminded me. Yes, my wife and I recommend this.
