I remember seeing this film when it happened first in 1982 and then loved it. About 4 years later I had the opportunity to see Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York (in Tosca) to see the end of this film reminds me of that great night. Why not love about this film? Music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was very good and still looks good. The story is very true in the area and the area of ​​'fighting food' is still one of the funniest I have ever seen. A hot airplane climbing up the Napa basin was beautiful and so the song sang "If we were in love" (one of the rare Pavarotti sang in English). And hear the duet of Santa Lucia good. To find real people, this was a film about an opera singer named Georgio Fini who just came to play with Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were the best in their support tasks. I am so happy that I still have this VHS close to this movie but I would like this to be given on the DVD now that Pavarotti is no longer available to us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma she played with on the film today!
