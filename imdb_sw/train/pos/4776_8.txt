I was watching this film at the same time, which is really late at night. Usually if the film is not suitable for me, I will begin to sleep and speed up the refrigerator to remain. At first I thought it was what I had to do since pacing this film began slowly, with the fact that its shots continued to stay with a long character. But after a little, I started to get more in the movie, as more revealed on the main character through his story to tell. At the end, you feel like you know all your life. The movie put my interest so much that I did not even know the sun had risen. <br /> <br /> Not much of Lynch's style of bizzare, but there is enough for quirky characters to make an exciting film.
