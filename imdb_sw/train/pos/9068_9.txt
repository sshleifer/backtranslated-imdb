I thought children in the movie were great. I deal with children in this age group, and I think their behavior was very trustworthy. I had a problem mentioning the private parts made by the age of 5. I think Luke Benward is up and coming to the star. I would like to see him more on the big screen. I enjoyed its effect on the situations he found. Children in this group often do things without thinking through the results. Almost all actors did so in all the film. I also think the bullying message needs to be further searched for movies and this age group. It is a great problem in today's schools. <br /> <br /> Last not expected. Billy's comments about whether he won or did not win the bet was very surprising. How he used the situation was better. Often children today do not give up. Actors in this film showed that harmony is an important part of life.
