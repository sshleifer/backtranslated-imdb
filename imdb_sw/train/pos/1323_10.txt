A well-known book on honor of the death of a man in Jordan is given by his preachers after the charges have been made; associated with other former claims of the author as the wife of the wife. A few years later, he wakes up, acknowledging that he took a certain amount of big license but was willing to cooperate with the filmmaker to prove his substance. What follows is a fascinating understanding of the pathological nature, a person whose behavior does not make sense but what he is saying is true, but who seems to be unable to say anything that is not surprising but is not well established and often, for false lies. It's hard to imagine what Mrs. Khouri expected to get to be seen in this film: confirmation? celebrity? - all that he is doing is to carry out a certain image of himself as a very spoiled person, and even that cannot be taken for the value of the face. Director Anna Broinowski looks increasingly on the camera as his film continues, and is increasingly stimulating boot; but finally he was given a wonderful reward, though scary and horrible, and one of those films that remind us of the world we live in.
