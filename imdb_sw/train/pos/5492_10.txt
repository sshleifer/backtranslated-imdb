I was impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for some time now, but I have never seen the film at Amsterdam's international film that I realized what she got. The film describes the story of fighting with the elite of Venezuelans, oil companies and western governments of the corrupt government, removing the Chavez president of democracy, and returning to Venezuela behind the brutal dictatorship. This film is a must for anyone who believes freedom and justice, and is also a lesson for the whole world! I thank the people of Venezuela for taking the matter in their own hands, and saving their country from the love of the Halliburton government and Bush.
