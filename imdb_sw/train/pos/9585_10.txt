In amazingly put together. I wish there were to follow this document to follow with some lives and celebrate the lives of the other lost ... there must be two parts ... one real. It was good. The film wasn't enough. I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow !! this is important for the community. If this is read please consider making another kind of document ... I am too tired to hear from the authors of ignorance how AIDS and Men go when they don't know; in fact it is a hetero of that we need to look at the ... this film has not bothered even mentioning HIV or AIDS and I was very happy with it. Thank you very much for allowing this film to exist.
