this is my first review on the IMD, I didn't want to write one but because there is only 2 of this current film right now, I feel compelled to add my opinion ... and no, not associated with filmmakers in any way (that's how many times you are here before ;-)) I am at the end of my 20s / 1 <br /> 1 of all I must admit I love animation movies, because what you see is only limited to creative ideas and were good to think about this. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and unusual style. The characters look good but far from the real and it works well for the film, after all being the fairytale world. But nature and the world are generally filled with amazing pictures that my jaw dropped several times during this look. Blue, as a mini-dragon steals the show and easily some of the funniest moments of the movie, he is already a classic instant, as Scrat from Ice Age. Story is not surprising (a group of combat fighters should go out and kill a big dragon you can think of) but he cares about whether the movie looks and seems to be good ;-) 1 thing I must tell, the movie is not suitable for very young children because it has bad experiences in it and perhaps awesome for children under 6-8 I can say, these are just a few scenes but mention value imo. However I had a good time to look at this and I can't wait to hit the shops in a high def to watch it regularly only for its beauty. <br /> <br /> 8,5 for me
