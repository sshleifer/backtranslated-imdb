This is a wonderful film, brain, surreal, esoteric. If there is such a thing as "fear of mind" movies, this film is. I began to be afraid and I would like to have someone else looking at me, and it's very difficult! I will need to see this film many times before I feel understandable. If you are the kind of person who likes "Food Food and Andre" and the film by Godard, or if you are doing so much to change the mind, maybe you like to enjoy this film. Wow.
