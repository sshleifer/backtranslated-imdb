This movie should not be compared to "Sting", or other film caper / heist / con. What makes it a great experience of film is what it says about relationships, deception and dishonesty. It is also a definition of refusal of the mind, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who can be easily deceived and then does it in the first way in the finale. Did Mr Mamet have an unfortunate experience in treatment? In particular, it was highly recommended!
