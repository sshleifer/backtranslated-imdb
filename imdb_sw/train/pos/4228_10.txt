The top piece of Columbo from beginning to end. I especially like the interaction between Columbo and killer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As a bright Columbo fan, I cannot recall another that does not end the last killer if he does in other periods. In this, trying to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the "message" that the nephew lost back, eventually comes upon it. <br /> <br /> Music in this section is also very good, as in many other things.
