I read somewhere (for sure verification) that this is something of the anime life, and I think they're on the right lines. I watched this film for the first time when I was very young and died again, and I finally made all the records come back. I don't think this is taken very seriously - it's just the fun of the 80-year-old fun of TV (installed against the back of the future of the dark future, although this point has not stressed too much). I liked so much about this film that the discussion did not have a common voice - no clich√©s, no possible lines - all with just good fun! Maybe when you have never been a virtue to this small movie, but I can still get thanks for me. It doesn't mean a whole, but it's fun and it doesn't try to be anything else. Let nerds and boys of comic-worry about technology - caring? See yourself and make your own decision. No one else's views.
