I thought this really was not bad. Not a good work of art but Dermot M was a very powerful actress. Patricia Arquette was losing a lot of time. He was playing the cello which was so amazing, and his lines have never been forced. Besides, he is a very good Man. Really sexy. Add it to the talent, and whatever she has could be more acceptable. He gives each one even though some of the projects that he has been involved had no high score. It is not an actor's fault in many cases. Unfortunately he has had some amazing films that he had no success at the box office. Always with the executives of A list but not always "hit". But he is "worth every penny" of any DVD rented or purchased. See Wedding Day and Debra Messing - one of her best films. HOW TO PENNY ALL! ; ) (if you haven't seen yet, do, then you will understand that quote!)
