I went to see this film twice in a week and could only make it in one word (which is not normally used a little): Wonderful! In my view, the best movie is made. Who is eligible for Oscars and other awards if not Swedish employees who have created the fullness of movies in the last film, while everything that is said (and supported) in the story is shared together? As Daniel Dareus's character expresses a lot of emotions and feelings that have been overthrown for a long time in the people around him, the film is like his audience: You are walking with your head of reply and your heart full. Great things! Sometimes when you ask yourself “what is the meaning of life”, perhaps think about how you feel after a great experience as in heaven: happiness, content, fulfilled. Talk to Virginia Woolf's Dalloway: "At that time is enough".
