I have read a little about Che before watching this film and want to know something, he was a real hero for people because he just wanted to see everyone equally and that he hated those oppressive forces that made his people like all other South American general ! Now, I do not know about others, but for me it did the right thing to seek socialism so that everyone could pay their fair share. However, powerful scholars did not go to it. Therefore, instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they had to kill him in trying to prevent the coup. It did not work since there were many other supporters who took only where they left. A good example of this is when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. In addition to I'm concerned with whether Che said herself right before dying: "If you kill me, that's good but you kill someone, you can't kill the reason!" I can't say my best thing. But ... for every .... that's why I am giving this film out of 7 out of 10.
