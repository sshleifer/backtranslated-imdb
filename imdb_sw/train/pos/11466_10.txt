I was lucky to see the Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. Very competitive for it. <br /> <br /> By the way, the day of Zero is the same as the "Project Wizard of Blair". It's a fullley shot and camcorders of the hand. It is about 2 children. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against the High School called "Military 2". The entire story is sold in the Diary Video form, from two children. It shows there are relationships with parents there, among other people, showing that these are just ordinary children, like people we know or who have entered. We see the last message of the last 2 Message will be responsible for Zero Day. They plan to shoot there at the High School. You see how they get guns, how they plan, everything. They insist that the media will not affect them completely, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, this is all described in the Diary Video form, and then saves the region to the security deposit box to appear after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> Realistic calls are shown through Victory Camera at school. Chilling really. The film is too high. Some of the things they say, how they plan, you deserve to see yourself. One quote I remember is the only time Calvin likes. He says "Andre thinks they were leaving the getaway car, doing so for many schools across the country. I don't know what he thinks, but the only way I get out of school is in a black plastic bag". <br /> <br /> I am probaly even not giving you the correct idea of ​​this film. You need to see it yourself. It goes to the ceremony right now. A /.
