Higher training is beaten to the face for those who have been in the closet for a very long time regardless of ethnic background. it is something that most of us would like to ignore but we can't afford if there is a real change in the way we can accept and understand the difference. But they have criticized this film as hate or silence but the fact of the matter is, the rule of ignorance is the greatest in the world and several continue to help guide our community. Anyone involved in this film has done a good act in showing the steps that should be continued to do so that you do not make the film again as high-learning.
