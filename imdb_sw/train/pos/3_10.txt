"The whole world is action with its administrators in it" - or something like that. What? Hell said what the theater has been reinforced in the orchestra - or even at the entrance to the sport? Why not participants of the participants in the exhibition experience, including the story itself? This video was a great attempt that said: "Hey! The story is you and it needs more than your attention, it requires your active work". "Sometimes we bring you a story, sometimes you have to go to the story." No one listened, but that does not mean that it should not be said.
