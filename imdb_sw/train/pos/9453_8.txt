Rescue is an exciting story, haunting and sometimes even disturbing by James Dickey, turned into a brilliant film by John Boorman. It is about four businessmen, driven by humanity and behavior, who use the marine weekend to the top of the mountains. Until then, they are faced with every dark side of man and every worst kind of human suffering ... poverty, buggery and even physical abuse! The four men wanted to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their recent journey is changing to odyssey through a mountainous and turbulent mountain, quite different from all kinds of civilization. All of these things actually make one of the night's nightmare I have ever seen. Almost everything happens to these men, you pray that you will never find yourself in such a situation. Talking clean movies, Rescue is a very important movie too. John Boorman's best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and is still a very influential film and has some pictures that have not yet been featured on other non-number movies. Just think of the bad music of "Dueling banjos" and, of course, unintelligible homosexuality "likes like a hog" of rape. All executives provide full performances to make (haha). Especially Jon Voight. You must see the image of motion!
