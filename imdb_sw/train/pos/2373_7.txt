Photo of Pendragon Pictures "" H G Wells "The Battle of Isilo", the first change of the original novel of the previous novel, has been in development for 5 years. The DVD ran out of the version of Spielberg, which blows the film on June 29. <br /> <br /> I loved this film, and some reservations. <br /> <br /> How honest is the transformation? It is not 100% credible to the book of Wells, but 90 - 95% honest is good for me. At least several events were quite new, such as Ogilvy's star star and farmer, with an unknown player / player with tea and cousin. But in general, this film follows the book very closely - much more than the classic 1953 edition by George Pal. Its great design is that it has been done with a very cheap budget. Many of them seem to have been beaten screen-blue and are included with digital rendered backgrounds. This is especially offensive during most interior shots, and local city-wide events. A total of 1898 London looks like something from a video video. Most of the horse racing cars were hit - I think they could not rent a horse. The only events that are presented to "real" appear to be in the fields or forests. But within budget constraints, they could do much. With courage, the film looks similar. Martians and their trips have been done well, and it is true for Wells notes. I was especially impressed by the heat. Although a series of Thunder's Child, which should be one of the highlights of the film, is very desperate. It is a great shame that they could not find the exact set, or the best animation. Action and direction will not win any Oscars. For the most part, they are capable, not bad, but not better. Music is also very good, although it is not the same as most Hollywood Hollywood writers. I am so glad that you did not get the release of the exhibition, because the maximum budget would make it look very bad on the big screen. As it stands, I would like to measure this standard as the BBC-TV reconciliation of the ancient texts. <br /> <br /> Nitpicks a few: Most of the events are provided with various color filters (more red). This may be an artistic choice, but it is widely used, and it looks more like a poor DVD work experience. And the fake applicant / false writer separates from location to location. <br /> <br /> Under the bottom - Is it worth seeing? If you can look back at the technical and budget deficit, and get into the story, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you have read the original H G Wells. If, however, you easily stop the quality of cheap production, you would like to approve this (unless you are a fan of MST3K). You understand, however, the film is facing 3 hours full, so I do not recommend all lost in one session. BTW: A completely different version of the World War (aka "INVASION") came on DVD the same month that Spielberg played the video: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. This was also developed in the budget, but it is up to today as a Spielberg film - but it's better! And on top of it, Jeff Wayne is making a film of his best album since 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.
