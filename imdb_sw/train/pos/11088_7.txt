Villian in this movie is one half of the meaning and seems to enjoy what he is doing, so I think to make him more meaningful. I don't think most people would like this film, especially if they ever hated their wife. This is one of the most durable movies that have lasted. But then, where you have, the end of candy makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL." Very good movie until the end. The end is the end we would like to see but not the end of such a start. And then there is the result of what happened. I think you can make your own mind on the end end. I'm left feeling that only one character should live in the end.
