This is a very well-designed, well-designed and well-designed film that makes it sometimes migrating deeply - for example the area with a perfect but unsuspecting singer with his wife. This program works and exciting. The character of the gangster is very interesting and has a close tangible role in the life of the hero. It is explained that fighters are as bad and ready as gray characters. Little reservations: I have found a little relaxation on one side as it celebrates the success of the hero's success in the police structure and the justice system, which is faced with the complexity of police officers who have been saved until that point. I have also found the female character of a weak woman: a little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, all he makes do is right and waiting as hard guys fight out.
