Chase has created a real thing with The Sopranos. Unpleasant displays, rock-solid text, and good music does what is possible to show the best. All of the cast are powerful, but Falco and Gandolfini got every inch of Emmy. Anyone who includes this requires only a sample of a few events; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is very, very scary, and you still find yourself loved - standing with him. Most people that I have spoken about Sopranos (who have not seen yet) "It's not a fan of films / shows of mafia". Whatever it is. Run - don't go - and get it. These people are interested in "E.R", but I do not have many services to the hospital ... It's not about the environment.
