I am really angry with the comments I read and say that this film was "boring" and the beautiful environment was destroyed by black and white pictures. It was done in 1925 !!!! I think it's quite amazing at this time! The journey that these people had to use is quite amazing. It took them just a week to cross the river. Women took their children in heavy wooden cargo on their backs to climb on a solid rock sheet, sometimes without clothes in the snow. I would like to see anyone do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good film with some amazing shots and fantastic stories.
