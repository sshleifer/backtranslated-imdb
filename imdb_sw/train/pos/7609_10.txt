Exactly brilliant show. The second season began when the first ended, and many secrets. Stand for many, if not all events and hidden everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It is really amazing how the author can come up with all the connections and integrate all the characters together and combine all the elements to make the lives of the characters in that meaningful show. Never fail to be excited and I expect a new season. We hope more secrets will be revealed and at the same time, more secrets will be solved. A good choice of cast also for this show, compare the characters fully. True can not wait to finally discover the secret. Hope that all the smell can not destroy the end.
