A typical seducer who stood and was beaten and displayed by the director who apparently took the matter seriously. Completed, as expected from a filmed film in a strict budget, but this game includes - is one of those films that get ad anduseum regularly on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever they call, you have stopped checking 40-minute blocks when you should go to work. With "Deathstalker 2", "Cleaning Mall", and "Assault", reminiscent of that Wynorski is the most talented director than most of the budgets of the lower budget, who has the real ability to speed up the film type, when it likes very much hardware (ie, do not bother to check any Shannon Tweed of his flicks with 3 or 4 post title!) Pastors who have had very little to do soon (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) actually put all of them in some of their roles The best in years - as for Grieco, he has to look right, although his acting is a little-note - it obviously his character should be self-destructive in the film, but Grieco is not quite suitable. I watched the IMDB and I see the author also wrote "The Murder of Sorority 2" and "Dinosaur Island" to the director - religious scholars in their rights, but it is clear "ignorant" Roger Cormon-like Cinema - this is more like Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-best image of 70 years - give you an element of exploitation but offer a simultaneous sacrifice at the same time - a real action. Not "Kane's Men," and at the end of the comic is a bit of damage, but a well-organized player, organized for the above-average direct behavior. Little achievements like these should not be overlooked when they come, which is enough (as I have been reminded if I tried to stay in the monstrosity of Albert Pyun called "Heatseeker" the other night - these under-budget items are not as easy as it seems - but that's another story!)
