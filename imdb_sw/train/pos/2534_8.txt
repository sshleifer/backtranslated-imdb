The scientist working in the intervention finds a way to find the impact of a meteor effect with a new radio feature. Both (pseudo) science and the successful communication of the 1930 years of technology are the same, including the idea that radioactivity can heal any disease if it is well integrated. When he called his opponents - who drove him out of the scientific community and laughed at him - to witness his discovery, they suggest a 'joint' journey to Africa ... of course they live to steal the dr. The original Rukh discovery, gave him only a residual interest. Besides, a weak person who looks like a comedy actor from a bad Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. Rukh's young wife (Drake), who falls head on the heels with a scrap of man. After planting horns like pigs did not dr. Rukh (Karloff) any partner, so he enters into a message of vengeance for revenge ... Kill 2 of his enemies with a friendly dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who had helped him ... finally rejected the deadly radiation that allowed him to begin revenge and start (but to be totally unhappy) leaving a prostitute and that a bad excuse for man was married. Work is very good, and Karloff & Lugosi are very good. Check out the traditional pride room area ... Other characters will not value value ... Recommended, like all Universal Universities ...
