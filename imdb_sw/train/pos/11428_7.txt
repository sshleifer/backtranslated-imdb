In reflection on this film I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One of the forgetful but covering the geography, is the Coup de Torchon, thousands of miles away and the biggest is the Indochine non-forgotten. Claire Denis has produced a film that has some of the best elements of Indochine, a tough and intricate relationship between France and its colonial studies. I was beaten with respect to Potee, and his efforts to maintain his respect among his colleagues and his white supporters. I was also struck by a relationship of love / hatred between him and Aimee. It is the end that gives the film a dynamic film, it's the end that unites this film to Indochine. One never knows what motivates everyone, although some characters need to remind colonialism. It is this exciting side of the story that connects to the Torchon Connect. They are the most scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in the way caused, but Denis reminds us of how it had all the tension and unchanged relationship. The American black who gives life to France at the beginning and the end of the movie provides another interesting side to the chaos that we in the Western world as we look at Africa. He says that when he came he found everyone called. He came home, but just thought it was a little daft. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but they do not fully understand what they might remember how it was. <br /> <br />
