When I reach the "back" of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more in sex, drugs have been affected by today's youth. It was good to be reminded that it was a wonderful thing for me in my day as it is for young people today. This film film shows at home. If you are a 70-year-old fan you will love the movie. From the KISS banners at this Angel's Festival of Rocks! See the boy Laura Dern. Why didn't they have more songs from Runaways I never know? I had a problem with Randy Quaid's behavior that opened a 16-year-old girl. When she was away she and her friends have a party that destroys the dude house. Businessmen come with everything but there is no mention of all the low drinks and how these children make their hands on these things. <br /> <br /> The dirt is right there and Over the Scope, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of all the youth when flying. I say I buy and watch it with your children and talk about it all.
