When Gundam0079 became a trilogy movie most of us are familiar with, much was a big step and under anything else. This OVA is kinda opposite. Although there is only half an event, he is not full of action, but emotional. Two main systems of action in this, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. Having seen many series of gundam, movies, and OVAs, I was already quite ready for the movie of the elite. This movie did a wonderful job of it. What makes this film stand is that it shows two sides of the war with good and bad people. It made the exhibition more human than the original movies where it is shown as a second increase in the evil Nazis. Many people who do not like the anime that I have to watch this movie (lol), liked it. Therefore, I would like to recommend it to most people only with anti-war stories. If you are a fan of Gundam, and you haven't seen this, you shouldn't read this; you should already be looking right now.
