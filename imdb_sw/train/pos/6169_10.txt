The Rohinton Mistry published a lot to many proved impossible to deal with the screens but the movie driven is full of passion, emotions, humor and pathos. Story is slow-moving but there is always something on the screen to attract the audience. The movie takes full time and somewhere with pinpoint accuracy. All actors are Indian - few as known to the "western" audience - but they are delighted to see, especially a little girl who makes a lot of influence. Do not be taken by the title and summary of the compound - this is a movie that is visible on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from them.
