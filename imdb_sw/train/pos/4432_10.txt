I gladly admit that I am a sucker for a good film, and enough movement of enough cameras and horns can be enough to keep my interest in a long film. Not one of Gojoe's length though, even though it had the most amazing performances I have seen since the Korean MUSA period. However, Gojoe gives more beautiful pictures (such as MUSA ... not a comparison) - it's the second major power is a good acting, and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I must admit to be absolutely sure what you were trying to do at the end, but you actually persuade some ideas on the way. Open, but certainly thought: p <br /> <br /> One department whose film can be better is the action. There is a huge amount of blood supply in the film, but all the actions have been made by close-ups of hyperkinetic, and often hidden by objects in front. It does not create sharp and amazing images, but it would be good to see other real acts, which makes it more reliable that criminals could walk through all the forces to put waste to everyone. However, the film is one of the most attractive and beautiful films I have seen for a long time. Recommended!
