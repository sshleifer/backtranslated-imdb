* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the second pay-to-view I've been given 10 full, first being 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting games that they did not remember, just loved. And that's why I like it. The opening game between Razor and DiBiase, with Ludvig Borga against Marty Jannetty is the only score. They were a good match, but DiBiase deserved the best in his final pay for a match. Nowadays, such a match would have to enter with the great season of the first Razor of the babyface push. And Jannetty, having run the title of Intercontinental, would have a better match with Borga. But I don't think anyone cares. They only needed to push Borga on pay for television view. <br /> <br /> IRS and Kid were great, as were Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could win, but Michaels sleeps for anyone. See how sure after this, he came from WWF so he did not work on Razor. Bret Hart had two great heroes and Doink (see how the best match for everyone is against Hit-man) and then Lawler. Their opposition was normal; that's why Feud's year was a non-brainer. How many times do you see two legends win the Feud of this year late in their work? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heaven Bodies Match was one of the best of the year. Who knew the Articles can hold themselves against the best team ever? Many say Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez's match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the WWF of the past (as it was, before WWE) was a mix of armored games and casual show. What? Is there a spirit out there that doesn't like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although there is no place near the year's situation. They put Lex Luger well, but made a wise choice in having Yokozuna to keep the zone. He was the first heel since Superstar Graham held the belt for more than two months. Nowadays, heels are champions at all times. But since the beginning of the WWWF through the WWF of the 90s, if you wither, you have lost the head of the heel. <br /> As an old fan of school competition, this and SummerSlam '88 is my favorite.
