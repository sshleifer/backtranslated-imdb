The Crash Market of 1929 and the subsequent Depression was destroyed the Theater Musical Theater, in fact it was the last blow to death for the veudeville. Those behind the curtains were beaten as bad as those in front. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate the trade economy of the show and its own economy, outside the director of the works show James Cagney comes with brilliant ideas. Steps have to be suitable for movies that are shown on various cinema movies that appear one night from old movies. Other participants get wind and competition continues. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite movie of Busby Berkeley. It gives James Cagney a chance to show some of his mix as a player like a tough boy. During retirement, Cagney said that while looking at a few and far between music, she was concerned with some of her amazing films. He liked to do a few more music in his work and I would like to have it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the staging of these extravaganzas Busby Berkeley at the stage of the movie house makes all logic and reason. But it's creative and fun to see. Dick Powell gets three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel, and By Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler more to strengthen the team's screen. Ruby sings and plays with Powell in the last two years and she associates with James Cagney in my favorite number from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is a girl of Cagney who has not heard Friday in the playground. As in Crazy Blonde, he has the real sense in the duo and it is his quick thinking that drives them out of the inner troubles that he has on his performances. One of the best works of Blondell. See Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in chorus for IMDb pages for both. John Garfield looks briefly in Lil Lil's number. And in the early movie area, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to the cinema where they show the western B with John Wayne. The voice of Duk is impractical. But even more common is that a piece of short picture shows him in the area where Frank McHugh is playing another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade. I think Warner's brothers were playing joke there. I must believe that the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley in its best surreal.
