I only measured this ten because I find it amazing that a 18-year-old can do with a video camera. It's not an epic but it's very involved and I've never bored. If hundreds of millions of dollars can get into the worst films that are being violent, then make me an equalizer to see what happens. I know I will be in the cinema for her first release. Dial a good job, and deserve the value of money. What a script! It can be a low budget but it blows out of the top half of the big pictures I've seen recently. Nanavati knows how to tell stories, by writing and on the screen. Too big for him, he can't wait to see more.
