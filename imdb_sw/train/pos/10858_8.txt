enjoyed the film and the practice of the Confucian crime efficiency, the old system breaks down the threats by a greedy young man, of course representing the modern society. I thought the last area was strange and could not understand if we believed that the big D was being punished for being greedy or part of the long plan. I loved the area and once in the Chinese movie, violence was not a fire of martial arts selected. Something that constantly emphasizes the HK films is that the biggest influence of the UK seems to have set up 'yes sir' and 'pole' in the local language and its stimulation for a long time after leaving, still there.
