I am really surprised to see the number of reviews that are taking this movie. This film was not intended to be a "very thoughtful" film, which is what many of the reviewers seem to think is necessary. In fact, it will appear that if every movie is not suitable for understanding the life-changing, and a deep, distorted, thoughtful mind, it would measure 1 or 2. Do not lose the film because you do not like genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was Flick Action & Comedy, and all that was intended to be. And for Action / Comedy, it was very good. In fact I was surprised that I enjoyed as much as I did, without having a fan of Jamie Foxx, and having a plot to use more that has. The plan was not surprising, using a typical offender who gets in prison, and he is healed in a conspiracy while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc. etc.) but decreased for a little loss of technology. Now "bad guys" really are "good people" and REAL "bad man" is uber-geek. Jamie Foxx really tempts, at the same time rather than mind and very big character, and does not try to eliminate the humor of the film. If you are looking for a large base site such as "Matrix" or a festival such as "Manya and Men" then this film is not for you. But if you are interested in crude action, a good fast image, and sometimes when you scream, this film will not offend you. I would have a maximum of 8 (to the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave 10 try and bring the score up to what should be. <br /> <br />
