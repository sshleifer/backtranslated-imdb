I am very sorry that this interesting and modern film (which I saw once the first opening in the early five years) has had a very poor reception recently. In my opinion it has been knocked down very much - but perhaps it is more appealing to Europe's sense of humor than (for example) the US: maybe we in Europe can understand and appreciate its tricks and situations, as we are closer to some of them in real life ! Specific mention should be made to a small but beautiful music - especially an interesting and memorable song "It is fine, good night", which was given differently in the memory of HMV 78rpm (10 studios of plum, I think!) In five years. I would like to encourage anyone who would like to try a test if you have the opportunity: you can have a good surprise.
