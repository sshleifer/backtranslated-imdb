The first time I came on Delirious, I just heard it. I listened to the entire comedic performance and never laughed in my life. Eddie's ability to paint a picture of a hilari in our imagination and make a great imitation is stimulating. When I finally saw him doing this, I needed to have it. The performance of Eddie Murphy on Delirious shows his skills! Despite the new millennium, his actions in 1983 are as wonderful as they were then. My parents liked it as a youth and I (eighteen years old) I love them too. Since then, I had to see other Murphy movies such as coming to America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other player like Eddie.
