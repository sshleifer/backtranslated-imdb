This is an amazing film, all with enough energy generated by the flamenco frenetic play, and in a special way that the film's filters make a story of the production of action and the life of the actors preparing. Investigation is the only word that I can use to describe the experience. This is not 'Carmen's Bizet' to any standard size. This is not an ordinary film at any rate. Each view includes, each stomp of the foot, each piece of music is so complicated that you can't take your eyes on the screen. You don't need to like opera or flamenco (I don't know) to be taken, taken, hit by this film. Without and directly; loud voice and still; One of them, if not the best, such movies, because there are a few like that.
