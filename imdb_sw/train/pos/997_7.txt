I agree with many more posts. Was it a comedy? game? I was going a little bit on the side of the comedy. I would be a great movie without comedy and it was very badly generated. Jamie keeps running into Julio and what his name is. In New York, how often do you go to someone you know in Cleveland? How could Robert Pastorelli dig up Yankee Stadium to hide gold. Again, comedy or game? But it was still very entertaining for Sunday morning. I enjoyed the performance of Kimberly Elise, for sure she is a good actor and seems to take her craft seriously. He is a small actor who will be profitable.
