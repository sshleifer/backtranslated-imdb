I work in the library and I expected to love this film when it happened 5 years ago. I loved Parker Posey very much (he is a wonderful actor) and Omar Townsend was very good as his partner (he couldn't do but when he looked like he cared?) But the film was bad. It was not funny or cute or a lot of anything. Posey put the film with his power. But he learned the system of Dewey Decimal CHEMICAL and then on the shelves of books for music? !!!! ??? Come! I also had a problem with the way he looked when he was a perfect reader at the end - hair in blue, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let that award go please? Value to see Posey and Townsend but that's about it. The TV series was much better.
