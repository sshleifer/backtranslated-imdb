Well, I have found the "Rock" N 'Roll High School, "nearly 30 years after the start of the midnight night film of 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will see this first summer document" Patti Smith "). : The Dream of Life ‚Äùsometimes around 2040! And no, the film does not feel dated one, and yes, it was worth waiting. This is a very high-energy comedy that includes massive music and some amazing moments. It says the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by P.J. Soles, and battles that he and his fellow students in Vince Lombardi High salary against their new repressive head, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," describes the effectiveness of Mary Woronov as "A bad Arden.") The usual teenagers against the story line of Establishment are written here with amazing humor (those who hit the mouse, that great mice, Hansel and Gretel hall monitors and some of the real lift tunes. The Riff is, of course, a fan # 1 of the original punk Ramones, and the band is compiling several of its main songs in the film period, including five on a concert which is a total explosion. In fact, seeing for the Riff for the horror of playing "Lobotomy of Youth" in this ringing can be a funniest time of image. With the first appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky at their Ramonesmobile, and later playing down the road singing "I Just Want To Have Something To Do," is quite surprising. The film ends with an explosive clash that is, I would like to imagine, every dream of a high school dream of rain. Fun things really. On the other hand, Ramones was one of the biggest bands I have ever seen in the concert, so I was very worried to realize that the film of this film comes with an optional English heads for hearing hearing. It's many aging punks out there that discovered these important headlines, I wonder.
