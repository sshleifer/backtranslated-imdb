A stupid young man is involved with a woman - so he is considered that he is losing his mind and common sense. The evil witch approaches him and tells him he can give him a great wealth that he can use to win a woman's heart if she accepts whatever she wants in her room. A dumb boy agrees with a witch who steals an image of a man out of the glass - and bad things happen normally as a result. <br /> <br /> If this film has been made only ten years later, I am sure I would have been so charitable in fixing and scoring this film. After all, the plot of the film is very clear in advertising and acting it, sometimes, slightly beaten. However, when you think that in 1913 films of "full length" were not compromised - and only 20 to 30 minutes long! In addition, any idea of ​​such a complex story as you enter this film is unusual - as stories were very short and generally did. Therefore, due to short-term shortcomings, this film is good and is one of the most scary films known.
