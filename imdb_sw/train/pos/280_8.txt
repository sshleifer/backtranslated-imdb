Removing is a very good game that brings new features to the first type of fatigue. The story of Patrick Galloway's expert on magic and a horrible warrior who is called by a friend on his property in Ireland to explore the mysterious spinach. Game regulated Ireland after World War I so do not have the prospect of getting weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. These weapons in the game can be considered antiques but true fun in the game is spells and their working system on our hero is ambidexterous so he can use hands at the same time: he offers spells with his right hand and uses his gun and left. So you can shoot and call at the same time which if you understand very fun and it's also unique to this game! The pictures are good and can run very well on the P.C... Particularly this game revolves around the House of House and House but there are many other places that are waiting to be discovered as you continue. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker this game has a good history and plot (a very few things for the first person shooter) and I said before a great and highly interesting sound voice sound is also good but not the best. But the game has two bad mistakes. First of all it is the same when your mission says for example going to the room all the doors in the house will be locked away from what leads to your mission room can save time but it allows your search freedom. Secondly the fact that all weapons are antiques can deny many fps players who are used high tech weapons. In addition to the difficulty involved with this game is very good. Most of them are medium difficulty but sometimes they get more trouble but not trouble. Generally non-inclusive is a good game. Certainly one of the best fps out there.
