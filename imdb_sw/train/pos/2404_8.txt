I am a big fan of Lil Lild that's why I've watched this film. Actually I doubt that if you were not in the movies I would like to enjoy it or even look at it but once I realized the story was very good. In the end, I must say but I saw it coming. It's a low-budget movie and some participants were not good but all in all I beat this 7/10 film. <br/> <br/> The suspense of wondering what Lillard was really up to what was reserved for this film. <br /> <br /> It is rent rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
