I am happy that users (like this date) who liked this film are now continuing. I don't understand people who didn't like this movie - it looks like they were expecting great treatment (?!?!)! So, how can hell take the push of a snowman striker to weight? The film workers knew this was a false premise, and they did not try to deny it. Provision of direct events makes it a FUNNY! Yes, there are times when a small budget shows (such as the explosion area), but I think the expensive look would be removed with the fun of the film! So if you like B movies, and interesting impressions are asking you, then you will surely be like "Jack Frost".
