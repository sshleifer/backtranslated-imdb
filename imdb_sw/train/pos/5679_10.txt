After succeeding the second phase, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should be seen by the third. This time instead of Tudor or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA elected Rowan Atkinson) lives during the French Revolution. Compatible with Baldrick who is now ignorant but loved (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is a "faithful" pastor for George, Regent Prince of Wales (Hugh Laurie). In this third series of Sitcom Blackadder has written everything he can get rich and powerful. She tries to choose a master for rotting borough, trying to sell the book, trying to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, trying to be a man of the road and finally sets as Prince. This is a very good phase for the popular comedy. It includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It won BAFTA for the Best Comedy Series, and was chosen for Best Design and Best Make Up. Rowan Atkinson was the number 18 on the Greatest British Artists, was the number 24 on the Comedians Players, and was the number 8 on the Lovely Player of England, Edmund Blackadder was the number 3 on 100 most popular TV people, was the number 3 on the Characteristics of the World's Big Boys, and the Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 on the Best Sitcom of the UK. Better!
