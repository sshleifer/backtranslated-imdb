It has never looked at this film and made it a very classic and past actors. During the period when the film was made, the people of America were different, there were no television or modern stuff we have today, except Radio and the great films made on Hollywood. The innocent stories of little love between a little girl or someone seemed different than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder Sweet My", 44 played a little girl who was named Karti Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken home to two older men, who were like two wise owls and watching Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if something happened, the whole city learned about it within minutes. It is under the world film and decent people are trying to help each other in a very simple way to live. Today, it looks a lot of grain and stupid, but I believe, this is the way people were in America during 1920 '. & 30 and they were a great family who loved the best family films.
