Full House is a great family show. However, after looking at many aspects I have often found that they are very strange and they seem to protect themselves from the outside world. Yes, there are many comedy, but there are times that are very strange. It's not like I hate it, but don't look at them often because they get quick. Perhaps the best season is the first. The perfect house is about the widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and her three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies she needs help. Therefore, his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and Brother Jesse (John Stamos) of the girls go with them. Once you live there together they find they can't live without each other. The perfect house reminds the important family and that you can return home again.
