Unseen appear to be more fashionable than the old Hollywood secrets to show fear. The film is slow but many amazing images continue to be a live film and appear. The basic thing of young girls hit by something below the floor is old, but good acting and production makes the movie look. The movie is known for its emotional impact and certainly not for any clear action or special effects. I tested 8 out of 10.
