I am moving to Boob's personal references, so I just go to write a clear review (no pun) proposed. I love Elvira, not in the "Way-to-the-lead-of-the-of-the-amazing-channels-promotion-fanatical" way, but it suffices to say I think she stone. The movie is played as a 50-year horror film just a lot of fun, see "Leasurely stroking of foot" memory to know what I mean. what relay shines through the movie is Elvira's (or should be a cassandras) perfect charm. I first saw this film at the age of 8, and I found it was useless since. I really should be around buying a copy, video video is looking a bit more for wear. If other movie fans like to email me about it it feels free. <br /> p. another good performance from Edie McClurg (chastedy pariah) an actor who has never been worthy of attention.
