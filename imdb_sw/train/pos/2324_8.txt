As I watched this film I started to feel very much. As a child growing up in the villages I felt like I was a child again! Swimming pool (called "tank" in Central Texas), which runs along the country as a free wild spirit! The story was reliable and I totally destroyed it and I cried to the end. Through the pain we experience in life ... life goes and there may be forgiveness.
