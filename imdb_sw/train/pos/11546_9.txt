Looking for the first time: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Work is very interesting and a performance of text and during this film. It is now 40 years old, has lost its power. Neil Simon shows a better understanding of human nature and relationships as well as how to create a real comedy from abnormal situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau offers great comedic displays. Neil Simon was followed by real events in his own life writing this film depends. One of the best written and used in Hollywood pictures at all times! <br /> <br /> Surprised, only was selected for the 2nd Prize for the Academy Award: "Best Screened Adapted" and "Best Film Editing". Hollywood rarely reward prizes, no matter how well they are.
