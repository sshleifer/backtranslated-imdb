Also known as the Spook World War. Yokai's great battle is Miike's attempt on the family film and the best work she does. The problem is that I can't imagine many parents who want to present their children to this film. The best movie for children is those who fear or have images of gentle combinations, Neverending Story and Rudi on the head of Oz to mind, but in the case of World War I Yokai Miike may take very little things. In fact, I was the person who started the film back to the two families that were not very good. <br /> <br /> The film blows away from the little hero of the piece identifying himself and describing his family's current problems. This time of destruction is broken down as a cow is born with a calf and a man who screams that something terrible comes before death as an abomination is (it is quite possible that an ecosystem is some of Quato's extraordinary worship). A wonderful for the bigdie Kato, and his wife Agi (amazing amazing Chiaki Kuriyami), through an army of fighting. The story goes back for a while, but it will not take long before any log and all goes down to run with young teen groups and the Miyazaki group refuses to take a bad witch. <br /> <br /> The layout of the movie is basic and surprisingly hackneyed from time to time, the entire chosen elect is simply the only place of the movie that breaks the regular clich√©s, but is supported by a simple impressive vision of the magical world. This is a Miyazaki movie made on a live action film, although it looks much more powerful and more popular than Miyazaki's movie. The film is just fun to watch Yokai's designs are of color, and is largely practical, while the robotic destruction of the worst time in the world is not the best CGI in the world has the perpetrators and risks to them that give them a greater threat than you could imagine. <br /> <br /> with the best balance, they only make their characters seem perfectly natural which is recommended when you consider that most of them are perfect body makeup or latex suit. Even Agi with a stupid bee comes with a great thankfulness and death for the best to act from Kuriyami. When the film has a lot of things that put it in the family movie area; The cute creatures, the heroes of the youth, the worst villain, the feeling of evil and adventure, and the lack of violence. There are factors that make you ask whether Miike should direct the film. The robot army is a daily horrible danger that has been imposed on fascinating animals that look like a T-101 skin and with a combination of chain. These animals beat the characters into pieces; The sandy organisms in their blood mouths contain, and give the children from their homes to beat them from under their parent's nose before embarking on a little patricide. The creation of a creature is similar to the minds of young people. Yokai, basically heroes, eats in a large furnace filled with hateful forms that eliminates the body of Yokai and compels their souls to be angry with iron smoke. If the children thought to murmur Anakin it was bad to wait even to see the hedgehog's magnificent size growing in a blast of a minute of hate before turning into a disgusting motorcycle. There is also a part of the cuts, on the one hand hand in front of a blood-moving camera, a large amount of sexual energy (Agi wearing one dress designed for fan service and looks just sleeps with Kato as inspiration, while Princess's Rivers they tend to almost anything and find her thighs and a little hero in several cases), and the general humor that will go well on those heads of which the technicolor wonder seems to be created for. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Example of this being that Yokai will only be interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party. The next war more spectacular than anything, full with beer, surfing people and moshing. Also the area that Agi picks up on a good furry creature seems to be used to appeal to citizens who have walked and overkill the pokemon. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers End of the day. Recent movies of Miike. Although there is no charm of the opposite of saying Gozu or Ichi is always just pushing the audience down the road to general spread. In fact this is Miike's very laughing movie because she accepts the great magic of the subject wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> You have only an hour value for a regular Gogo donkey.
