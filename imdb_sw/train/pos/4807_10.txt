I really thought that this film was very good. It's not just an accurate history, but the style is fine and you are still close. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's photograph of Victoria and how she put her spirit though she had to go into exile during her youth. Ignorance shows a historical way and sometimes that Vicotria was known (perhaps bad) for. The romantic aspects of movies are realistic and bidding that at the end of the movie you understand why Vicotria chose to live all of his days at the right of Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical elements of the film are also worth remembering. I appreciated the beautiful scores, which cause a lot of wonder with the great story of the story. I realized that the movies seem to be good, some of the events have left me breathing because of the beauty and glory they show. <br /> <br /> There has been a very small film this year as beautiful and tender as this film and standards as one of the best of 2009!
