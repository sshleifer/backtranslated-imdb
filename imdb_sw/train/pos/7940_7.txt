Eye in Labyrinth is not your average Giallo ... and being honest, I don't really know that it's Giallo; but Giallo or not, despite some problems, this is certainly a very small film. I am reluctant to call Giallo because the film does not contain many of the features that make these movies; but many types of forms break the mold, and this seems to be one of them. The film does not commit brutal killings such as Giallo does, but this has been done with a surreal situation and just a plot about a lot of confusion to remain attractive for a while. The plan seems to be very easy because you are looking at a doctor killed by Julie, whose patient, for some reason, sees her as a loved one and misses when he walks on her. We then move to a big house with several people, but nothing seems like there are a number of hidden things surrounding the events that came before Julie ... the film seems to say something about how intelligence is like a labyrinth. This does not really give up, and I just enjoy sitting back and enjoying what is going on instead of worrying about what action (if any) the film is trying to do. The eye in the Labyrinth is led by Mario Caiano, the director behind the best night of the lost several years earlier. We do not create an environment in this film as he did in earlier; but the surreal issues of the story come out well, and the mystery is always kept that keeps the film from boring. Film stars Rosemary Dexter, who gives eye candy and also provides good performance. Most of the cast are not to mention the truth, far from Adolfo Celi, who is as good as a piece of piece with Alida Valli, whose worship fans will remember from the whole cult of good worship service. The film describes itself at the end; which is lucky if I'm sure not the only observer who was more than a little confused and then! In general, this can be normal; but its good and worth seeing.
