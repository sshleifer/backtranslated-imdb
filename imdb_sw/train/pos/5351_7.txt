Although this film is filled with the eighth string, I have a chance in my DVD rack and I don't know why. I think I love it because the story of the story is 'television is garbage so turn away and go and get life'. For those who decide to focus on the message then you should try to read the book, nothing like a film at all. Destroy you at the end of the story Richards badly endless flight flight into the web building, suicide yourself, everyone inside and open the web at the same time. I read it many years ago but today it will be hard not to compare with 9/11.
