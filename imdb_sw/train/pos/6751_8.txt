Good films from Preminger; The labyrinthine time, as it refers to the sets and locales from different angles and perspectives such as was the original film in the modern city and how to survive. For this is visually and on a satisfactory atmosphere, as his hero, a good soldier and angry, gets in the very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews leads as it was Hamlet, and has never been better. The story can be clean melodrama but Andrews gives it a weight, and almost raises it to the level of the catastrophe. As her girl, Gene Tierney is interesting but not recommended. Gary Merrill makes a very attractive villain, and its normal temperature provides a beautiful and cool difference of Andrews; her smile, amiable-seeming bad guy seems to have always challenged his Nemesis and the only reality of his emotional state, as opposed to tightening the wound and good moral soldiers who are looking for him. <br /> <br /> There is no great surprise in this film, which seems a transition to all involved. For Preminger's leader is a kind of association with Laura his star, Andrews and Tierney, who had passed their peaks work at a time when the movie was released. cast help, - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is, mounted, more optimistic, as they all were moving up. Preminger, as a serene observer, has enabled you to open events without describing a strong view, as the end of romantic sexual morals, because the game of cat and mouse between two opponents seems to be bigger and more archetypal than any other movie can , solve a small amount. <br /> <br />
