Hey people, <br /> I've been watching everywhere to get these two movies and I can't find them anywhere in my area. (I am Australia). What? Please help me and tell me where I can buy. At Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies that have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie I was 5 and still even when I was a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except for my little sister because I have watched it so often that she has a patient. I love this movie and I haven't tried it until I return it to the DVD. Sally
