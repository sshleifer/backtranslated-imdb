This film deserves more recognition than getting. In fact it is a wonderful and rich picture of blood relations, grace and obedience in the world of crime. The film is beautifully clarified and clarifies all aspects of ethnic crimes such as betrayal and force. This film is a film film film, requires careful and understanding and payment in full. It is the godfather of hong kong and it is a welcoming change instead of other fighting wires, martial arts epic which seems to be a great contribution to the world of movies from Hong Kong to China. It shows the order of characters, artists and development though it is right to say I had to double it with nail what is happening with some of the characters due to having a lot of cooperation in the film. ALl in all 8/10 characters of the plot but there are characters who did not stand up and the music did not get the truth and sometimes I felt that it was not the same as the point (there is a step by way) so it loses some points for it.
