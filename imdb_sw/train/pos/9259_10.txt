It was simple but still very good. I think the meaning of the lack of sex in society, which can be bitter, was very much displayed. It had a kind of bitterness of hummer in it. The fact that most artists were not professionals, they made the film more obvious and more realistic. There was a "document" side of the film too. The best events are what all the girls, who were banned to watch, were eagerly listening to the soldiers, who should watch, spreading the game. If you are in Iran, having fun and playing on the road after the winner of the game, it fills you with the pride of the Nation! If you are not in Iran, you will still love it!
