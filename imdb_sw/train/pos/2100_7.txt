Before entering politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the most popular artists in the UK. This film shows its talent despite having a role to help in the stellar cast which includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of British Royal Captain who has lost her memory of the past 20 years, and Jenny played with US Ann-Margret in almost an unknown role as a doting sister. Alan Bates has a captain who has trouble with memory loss caused by the shell shock during World War. Sir Ian Holm has a small role as the doctor does. You see common faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne, and Frank Finlay. You can't help but watch Glenda play the house of dowdy housewife and first Captain's love but came from different classes. It's not the biggest movie but it's good to see the amazing talents of Glenda. He is still an amazing actress, comedy or drama. She makes Margaret Gray a good character and you see why the regal captain loved her.
