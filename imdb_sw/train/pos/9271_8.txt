That's what one of the girls said last. Is the soccer game an example of a qualifying game among girls (or more generally, thinking group) and authority? "Germany" means the future of hope? It is one of the most surprising experiences of the movies I have ever had - despite non-performing movies and conspiracy, even more effective (though I would like to be cast - are recommended and more comfortable for lovers). Worried situation has been sent properly. I can feel very confused by the rejection of the game (being a woman with a football fan) and I can't stop thinking about how to make hiding to convince you. I am wondering why there is no part of women that protection from dirty languages ​​and bad habits can be given - failure to cause causes of refusal. The movie is being done carefully - an amazing position, photography during real game, shortage, and different ways to keep viewers on characters' shoes - a game that is very important but not possible (not shown), light The exciting and exciting sound from the field, the closure of the van, and its effectiveness when the local unite and celebrate the outside groups. I can feel comfort from radio, drinks and food, and of course, kindness and consideration from each character to others. At the end of the credit, I am ignored that no character has a name - he is just a "soldier" and he is a "girl" or any "sister".
