Disney classic 12 with animation is a wise movie told through simple stories. Even though dated a bit, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics. It is not between Disney's top functions, but it's satisfying. One of the "Disney" functions of Disney, yes, but keeps magic with some magic (formerly Disney is known to them). This was an important movie because it has kept Disney from a stylish state. If this was a failure, there would be no other Disney sessions better. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is somewhat like the return of the first Disney's "Disney" classic and "Seven". brings a legendary story story. It is not known where stories are held, but I think it's somewhere in France because this is the basis of the story with Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting characters, such as Cinderella, Prince, Bruno (dog), Jaques and Gus (two great mice), God of fairy mother (for fairy she is really funny), Bird, King and Grand Duke. It is a very smart and exciting game. I love his voice. True has the same quality of mouse. Gus may not be wise, but wondering. The King is a hilarious king, but I think that what does it is funny is his anger. The Great Duke is a very cool and delicious shape as well. They are two of my favorite characters in this film and are responsible for much more exciting time. <br /> <br /> Prince is certainly one of the most interesting in Disney. Of course Prince Philip from "Beauty of Sleep" was revealed on this prince, because they are the same-looking. On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (wife of the wife) should not be recommended because it is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not better than she. However, the mother of you is not angry as her bad and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, have nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, black, beautiful and beautiful. By the way, I think his beautiful colorful red colors are much more beautiful than that provided by the God of Fairy. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (cat) is hilariously bad. The way he walks, strengthening his nose in the air and the words of pride and snobbish makes funny. Surprisingly she is very much like the mother of you when it comes to personality. She agrees with Mother's motherhood for Cinderella. Lucifer has her right name because she is a cat like a devil and worthwhile. However, nothing is heard about it. <br /> <br /> Sound sound is simple but fun, although not the best of Disney. The best song in this film is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". There are many skilled voice artists in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. His good explanation, though nothing is "out of this world". However, the King's palace is a beautiful, large and beautiful jewel.
