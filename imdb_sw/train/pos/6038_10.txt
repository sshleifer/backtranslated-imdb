But the opposite, the pole pole, I fully understand how you can be dragged in the film because you related to the subject (and you have). This movie is awesome, the main character would give the pastor of the charlie color to run for his money, often shouting which always laughs, many events feel more anxious than looking at another. then I will take. Best comedy of the UK? Please, brother, have a strong word and your evil self ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes ... and this film is awful. I mean doing good people involved ... they have made a film ... and maybe motorcycle lovers may be in it but people who are still living in this world with a real sense of humor will fight this more than exciting Christmas now they are buying you ... it was too hard? apologize ...
