Author of the correspondent Brian De Palma is known for his films that have been called, much less, "Hitchcock imitations." Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not stop Hitchcock; he borrowed a story or characteristic of things that can be seen in Hitchcock film and then expands on them through a more violent, modern. As Hitchcock, De Palma is known for combining the death of the blood spilled by the macabre humor. "We are wearing to kill," was made back in 1980, perhaps the most famous Hitchcocki film of De Palma, and perhaps the best. The story involves a carpenter who is wearing a cross with a mother of a burnt house (played by Angie Dickinson) and a wise street trader (played by Nancy Allen). Yes, it will remind you of the transparency of the "Psycho," but the De Palma flick is like a skillful and creative technology. The museum sequence is well-organized and edited; The elevator's dive area is also one of the most exclusive films of the film. "Wearing kill" can be original original, but I would say it is definitely worth your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
