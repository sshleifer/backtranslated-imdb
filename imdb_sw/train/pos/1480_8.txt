I'm now in front of the tv, watching Casomai. It changes, it is a dynamic id or better ... to develop. It starts with a courius wedding of two characters where their love story is reported. After everything has changed, the child was born, and the rest is happening to the couple. It's not a special movie because it speaks about ordinary people, and usually it's in the middle of this film. It does not want to show us something, nothing new, it is a common story of love, a couple's story, and being common is different from others. It is also a flaming movie, everything is a few, each area is only a few seconds. It is a news story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their views are basic, opinions create stories and destroy them. It's a simple story of a couple as I said, but it's not boring, it just shows a couple, it must be everything so-called, is, but I'm sure that each of you will need to know what happens, so give me 'forget to look at the last!
