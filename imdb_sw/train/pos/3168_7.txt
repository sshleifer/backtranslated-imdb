This is a small and sad story of cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has fled to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American guide and a rock hope and rocky move but a little cement to give a good partner. Kyoko "married" Ken so they can stay in U.S., to understand that although they will live together until it gets a "green card" marriage will only have a name. Soon it comes that the parties are not the same as the wavelength - or maybe in the "time zone", so it's the name of the movie. As an immigration attorney I have seen the “layout” that takes their own life, so I was glad to see how the filmmaker made the most likely of this situation.
