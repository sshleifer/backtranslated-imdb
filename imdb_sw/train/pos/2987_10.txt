This is what the Beaches never did. As I wanted to love beaches, it was always seen too fast for me to "feel" so (his voice is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, goes at a slow pace (and very much) and though it is a huge amount of cheating in its tears - it causes stories about a volunteer mother, it works because Bette and all others turn to good performances. 10/10
