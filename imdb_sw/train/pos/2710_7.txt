This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most popular films in small forms. It was released by Roger Corman, who had now produced a few WIPs. It is obvious that the film tries to play with a solid formula. The film takes place in the US prison, not in the "banana republic" as many WIP films. I don't know if that was a wise argument, but it is a change of acceptance for speed. The author's author Demme actually enters his work, constantly digging through a new way of presenting the standard. In fact, he is too young and greedy for his own benefit. The creator of the film builds a good guide for surreal dreams that are a layout but it is fun to see how he tries to put this film on your average chicks. But do not worry, Demme is still working within small variables. There is a lot of dirt and violence, which will satisfy fans of hardcore. The film is slow, but it's very entertaining. Sent is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP fighter, so he does not need the introduction, and Barbara Steel is hoot as a senior wheels-bound mad. Pam Grier is very lost, though.
