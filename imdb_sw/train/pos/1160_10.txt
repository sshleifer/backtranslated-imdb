It's funny. Not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but this person is funny. Kline and Fields are good. (Its run "God, you feel" if he climbs on his window - great! Kline gets into the door after blowing out Teri Hatcher - it's also great!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty works together easily - until she sees who she is actually ... The soap opera would turn if there was everyone! The environment near the end of the Chinese area was with my children and I climbed the floor - the area itself is worth rent rental. It does not solve any problems of the world or show it under the daylight TV (I hope). Just very happy.
