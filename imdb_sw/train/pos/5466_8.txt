Better, before the code of accounting accounts with Barbara Stanwyck as newly inspired (for the text of Nietzsche!) To overcome his feelings and self-exploitation, use people for his benefit. It is not true for the German philosopher but interesting that this was the year Hitler began to rule. Stanwyck, even in this version of the youth does not do much to me but he certainly does well here, ever driving himself with the film ahead. Not a lot of body shown here as a person who can expect but many dangerous situations and quips wonderful and innuendo. Enjoy it very much, if you do not distribute especially to humanity and I think for all honesty not a very interesting view of gold digging gold. However, that's life!
