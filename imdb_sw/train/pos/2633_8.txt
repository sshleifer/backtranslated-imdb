I should be honest, I expected that failure was very bad, because it was true if they tried to prepare the original movie to get money. But that was not so with this beautiful film (sometimes odd). I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with the Lion and he has trouble sleeping. The bubble of jacuzzi, and when Pumba stops, the bubbles stop. It is all unhappiness, good for children and adults. I think this film will continue for a while because it is good for direct video and DVD movie. When the movie is shown as an odd and odd way to the end, it works. 8 out of 10
