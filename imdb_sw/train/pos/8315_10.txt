Increased size for the popular story that has few points. One number, Lonette McKee as a sister who gives a wonderful star, a performance. The fact that he was never feeling great after this is more than me. Unfortunately, he is a supportive character and we are obliged to observe the behavior of Irena Carter of Bland, Sparkle, who elevates him for popularity is easy, stretch, and failure. However, whenever girls go to action and do, the movie comes back again. The original music with the Mayfield Curis should be credited. The text I saw was an old VHS tape. The quality of the image was very low, with the production standards that I think. All in all, it has a gander value.
