In the old business for empty audio cassettes, the line tag was "is it true or is it Memorex?" That can be said by events in this period - the collection and the remix of "The Cage," the first attempts of Star Trek. Mr. Spock has maneuvered the ship to put it into the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Capt Christopher Pike, his first captain who has been punched and paralyzed, back there. Why funding? Because having any contact with Talos IV welcomes the death sentence. Why is this not explained - this hurt me very much - but, if nothing, it adds stories. After getting a travel ship Talos IV, Mr. Spock returns to Dr McCoy (the most senior officer of the moment, Capt Kirk was off the ship) to be arrested and says, "Crime is mutiny, Dr. I have never received orders to take the ship." The next thing is the court of the court which - thanks to the Alma - we learn why it was important (rather than definite paralysis) for Capt Pike to reach the Talos IV even the death of Mr. Spock's death. The Alma exhibition creates, the back music and the whole story are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as The Keeper (head Talosian) is amazing. I call me sex but it never happened to me to have a woman in that position but was perfect! The Wemaa, having stopped almost all physical activities and almost entirely relying on the power of fraud, is also unisex; you can't say if it's male or female and it doesn't matter. This section, more than almost any in the series, makes me hope and pray for another world outside and that there is a civilization that has gone on so much! What something fresh like this was so! This is one of my favorite times and, no matter how many times I have seen it (I even have a video), it has never been interesting to me. Meg Wyllie looks like a stranger and I don't mean to be angry.
