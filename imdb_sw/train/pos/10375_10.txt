The country boy Aussie-Controller (Mat) goes to the city at night before an important AFL pilot match, where he will be taken by his cousin. And then things are not wrong. His brother does not have a hoper confused in the drug program involving Tiny into a loan-shark / drug (who looks like any gangster anywhere but it is obvious Australia). Of course, Mat is caused by chaos, and not long before the thought of tomorrow's match has been blocked behind his thoughts as nighttime shocks decline. Finishing Western Australian Western Shakespearean actor Toby Malone sets up a good performance as a small village child, and he is playing a part under his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Little, and the role of David Ngoombujarra as one of the fighters following events. Roll is a fast-paced, often funny, and the most valuable use of the clock.
