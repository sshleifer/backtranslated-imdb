This has become one of my favorite movies, and always will be. Over the past few years I have been 50/60 of Sci-fi freak, trying to collect all the best made at that time. I love many things about them from how corny can be and how technically correct some of them were. Great colors and sets give me too. It is a pity when they are doing some of these old old movies; they always do these things, - just look at the recent references of the Day that the Earth is standing, is absolutely garbage! A non-prevented planet is one of the full-time films, and now they are trying to do it again, and I'm happy to think what new will be! To my mind, other things, like the strange ethnic movies, should be left alone to be what is, typical examples of great experiments in telling a simple story, and giving people the joy in the process. Once you add the techno-crap all that we have available now, the film just appears to be a dog-meat from the sausage factory of Hollywood, - nothing special. By the way, I see that the astronauts uniforms in the World Planet are also used for the "Queen of Outdoor Space"! That just tells you that the budget has been a little back then, isn't it? Hey, small money and excellent film, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Good performances in this film from Leslie Nielsen, in a great role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has become one of my favorite actors), Earl Holiman, and of course Robby Robot! Special effects are amazing, and the story is not very good. This is a great experience of sci-fi!
