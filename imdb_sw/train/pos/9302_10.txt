Many views have been good but I would add that viewers should also focus on sets. The manufacturer put the most beautiful beauty treatments with beautiful buildings, levels, doors, furniture and so on. It is important to consider. The movie is dominated by features and symbols that are very rich. All actors of the gangster were thrown - it was like seeing old friends and it was treating. These discussions were exciting but often they were made and I think it meant to be so. This is a buff film of the film. It was made by people, for people who love among themselves. Don't miss this.
