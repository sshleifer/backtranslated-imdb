This film definitely gets thumbs up from me. It is a bold joke and even a regular and contemptuous opinion on the people of Eastern Europe I had stitches in many films. It is a conspiracy and a preliminary of 100% and will have to guess in the entire film. One person I was very impressed with this film was Hilary Duff. It is clear and easy to see that he has taken up the problem of faith when he came out of a kind of chick-flick that he had been. His priority is excellent and his acting performance was very surprising and well done. It's the best performance I've ever seen from Hilary, and I have seen many of his films. His character, Yonica Babyyeah is described as 'Britney Spears of Eastern Europe' and this appears in some of its ways and song, 'I want to beat you ... ... ... up'. You also sympathize with him, if his performance reminds you, Yonica is a very difficult and confused attitude. Joan Cusack screamed in all the film and his humor sometimes, but also his face and so on. John Cusack's honest conversation will probably make you lose. I strongly recommend this film.
