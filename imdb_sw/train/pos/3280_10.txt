I've seen this film once before, nearly ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and after watching I thought it was even better than I remembered that. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is more than just fear. It had an amazing degree of feeling and good behavior that goes through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was very good here. It is such a pity that he did nothing if he was the best actor. His explanation of the emotion in the film was complete with a false trick to get a message, especially at the end when he knew that though Marc was dead, he knew he would be just. Many artworks made me fly (which is a rarity to me in the modern film of fear), especially the area in the bathroom, where Anna's father was driving her with a wonderful radio back and a little where the legs broke and the fall of the soil. <br /> <br /> All in all, the best and highly moving film.
