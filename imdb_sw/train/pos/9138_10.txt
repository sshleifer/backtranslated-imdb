I have this film and I have watched it several times since it was released. Prince does not repent of his wonderful style or anything, he is a musician and I feel that he is shown here, he is just good to tell this story through influence. Most of this film is straightforward to the boy but that is the directors / journalists, still the best movie with the best music. Moral values ​​and values ​​in the Purple Rain are quite strong and as much more film would depend on the principles we are taught as young children we can have the best environment around the world to see that art shows life.
