This film is very good, but I give credit to at least try to give certain features to those principles. There are some good moments in the film and talks have a good time too. <br /> <br /> The sequence of atmospheric wounds is perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea of ​​how old an elder will go to his fellow elder. Certainly not all done well, but the premise is not so bad. Tom / Tom
