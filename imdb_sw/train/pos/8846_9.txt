I enjoyed this game from Sidney Lumet. The best word I could come to describe is insane. It gives us the viewer for about a minute and fifty and does not allow you to breathe until the credit begins to reach the end. Believe me, this film will allow you to think the whole way through. <br /> <br /> Stories are very good and almost brilliant. It's almost like the story of Tarantino more complex. Acting is amazing from every direction and even the smallest, the best. I also liked the movie, giving it a real sense as an independent film. It was all good. <br /> <br /> This game is excited, stimulating and breathing. It's hard to watch but you will be glad you have done.
