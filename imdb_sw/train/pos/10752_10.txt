This was an amazing, moving, amazing and amazing story that I have ever learned. In fact, even the profile cannot explain. I can only choose one area that was standing on me. I think if I had to list a few it would be the impact of the driver in the voice of losing the survivors to fly; the answers of the people who remained on the elevator, who did not know what was going on, if they finally emerged in a terrifying scene; shock and unbelief of the audience; and finally silent. That day, and even now, I remind you of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I heard a great problem in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in fear and were suddenly silent." It's amazing how accurate it is in his description. There was a real disruption in Power. <br /> <br /> This document clearly shows this disruption. Feelings are very visible. Anger, confusion, shock, fear, fatigue, and realization of its size. All here. Nothing was missing. This is a powerful and more moving and relevant document for Emmy. Not only because it is 9/11 document but because it's anything should be. If you have a plan to watch, make sure you take a tissue box. You will need them. I know that I did.
