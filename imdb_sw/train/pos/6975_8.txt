If I had just seen the experiment of this show I would measure it. Later sessions are not entirely dependent on the promise, but I will continue to look and hope that it will continue to be better. Production values ​​are amazing and acting is the first level. I don't know that it doesn't seem to fit perfectly with BSG because I'm attracted to the premise and let's talk to it, it's two different displays. I am glad that both Isai Morales and one of my all time, Eric Stoltz, are returning to my life (just as a weekly) if I have both been. This is a show that requires a bit of ideas from his audience and that it's always a good thing. You have a kind of covering your head next to certain show elements; things are not always as they appear and indeed there are gray shades, in fact and for example, in the plot lines, characters and, in fact, the virtual world. We all know how it feels, but the journey seems to be quite a trip.
