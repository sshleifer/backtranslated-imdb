Maybe I liked this movie very much because I've been coming down the dumps and it's a very good fairytale. For any reason, I thought it was the perfect pitch. Great, intelligent story, good effect, best act (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie has made me happier than I have been for a while. It is a wonderful and wise movie. The laughter of the kingdom of the kingdom of great destruction and surveillance, the way to get into the effects of magic witch and dozens of little touch all took me. That's a lot of what makes it so very good; is an elaborate, worth-destructive movie and more stories than many fairytale movies, but there is an extraordinary attention to small things. I feel like I continue to look at it again.
