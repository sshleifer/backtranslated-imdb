The movie concentrates on three friends, and follow them from those early days at the beginning of the war in Majorca, a few years later as two friends meet again when they are in sanatorium, lost in the country. > <br /> We meet first with three boys playing with fun. Not everything is visible. The tragic death of one of them says about the violence of the one who does the wrong. Boys have taken a little girl, about their age, from participating in their games. When we meet Ramallo's adult again, he is on his way to the sanatorium. She seems to have a TB problem. His surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his boyfriend's friends is also treated, and a little girl who refused to participate in their games is now one of the designers who manage their health care services. It is obvious that Tur is looking at Ramallo in a way that simply means that he has a love and a strong argument. Their relationship will have serious consequences. Roger Casamajor is doing a great job to show great Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes sense like Tur, a vulnerable young man. Antonia Torrens has Sor Francisca for guilt. Angela Molina, looks like Carmen, the guardian's wife. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. "El Mar" is a black film that shows Agusti Villarona's talent for making the novel live for the viewer.
