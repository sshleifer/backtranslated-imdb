This review comes around 30 years late. However, it is worth mentioning that I made a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it regularly for 4 months directly! I just needed to write about it! I was hit and I forgot anything else when I saw this film. What a surprise it is to see the historian of the literature publications has been shown by a powerful man! however, what kind of welcome! It was perfect for me and more because Timothy Dalton did perfect justice for his role. He gave an amazing performance and victory! I've never seen anything like that! All other actors are also good. The whole movie was put together for beauty. I don't care what anyone says about this movie. I just love it and love it! I made my happiness and satisfaction. It breaks down to say this but I would like Jane Eyre 1983 for P&J's A & E, which I believe is the end of the mini-series. <br /> <br /> Text from Jane Eyre has hindered a little back in school. I have never been around this book seriously to know the line of the story well. Seeing this production was made the story became alive for me and taking me to a nearby frenzy. Mr. Dalton's exhibitions and voices called me forever and eventually led me to read the book with weight, which, of course, is a jewel. Bravo for the entire team and especially for Mr.Dalton! This movie is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I offer a 10/10 rating.
