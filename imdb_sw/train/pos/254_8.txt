I am sure that not many people outside Australia have ever heard the story of Ned Kelly. I immediately saw a document about that person, but that's the only time I saw or heard anything about it. And I think that this could be a big problem this movie will face. No one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about it. <br /> <br /> The movie describes the life story of Ned Kelly. Irish immigrants have lived in the north-west of Victoria all his life, but it has never been welcomed by the authorities. The police are always accusing everything they can think and bother his family. While Kelly is getting in the way everything goes, it creates a group with her brother and two other people. They begin to steal bankers and even rob them of the whole city for 3 days. All this violence leads to a man hunting by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are banned. Finally they take the pub in Glenrowan, where they have a party with all the guests, waiting for a full train of police to decrease the part of the track that they discard. But the train can stop at a time because someone warns them and what follows is a war on life and death between the police and the four fighters ... It is very difficult to tell if all the films are true or false . I think no one knows, because there will be two camps that everyone will tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some sort of Robin Hood, some would say he was a common criminals, a murderer and a thief. I can't tell you who among them is right, maybe two are, but what I can tell you is that the fact in the film and also the document is the same. <br /> <br /> This movie was a good addition to the document I saw and enjoyed all performances. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are the most well-known actors, but even a few known actors show in this production which all know what good action should look like. I enjoyed this film and give it 7.5 / 10
