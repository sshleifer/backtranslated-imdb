The 4th movie of Pokemon made me cry when Celebi died. Do you have no doubt to say that Pokemon tend! I don't like when people say that .... I've loved Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this film and other Pokemon movies. Therefore, without more ado, please say that Pokemon is good and should be interested in people for all ages. And also, why the rivals of Pokemon provides low ratings for all or more of Pokemon movies? I don't understand .... They shouldn't do that .... There's absolutely no reason why people should vote without confirming that Pokemon takes over the fact that: 1) Pokemon is for only young children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not love Pokemon. I think this is why people do not like Pokemon.
