I loved this film! I am a true fan of Tom Hanks, and I am always impressed by all his work. From its great roles like Cast Cast, Green Mile, Save Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. For its proud roles as Agiano of Them, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, Women's killers, Big & really Toy Story. But in this film Hanks is not just a good actor who shines on the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, the highest and next star showing great promises in the co-Hollywood stars as Hanks son and does not give any good performance. Surely he is a man to look at his work, I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman always provides good performance on the screen. She is a true story. We can't forget people who didn't have great roles in the film, but they have helped to do so. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a very talented and talented, who performs in Bastard Between Carolina and White Woman Woman I have never forgotten, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the film and does a very good job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the film. She works very well with a very small role, and as her roles in the Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I loved Africa, gives good performance.
