Amazing film. For everything you might want on the film. Many wars and lots of votes. Suspicious, and the story of romantic love. <br /> <br /> Type as an old swashbuckler film. Enjoy it completely from start to finish. The edit was fast and you have never been bored for a second. The story is like a common story of trouble in the Royal House. Actors are good and good sets. Dress is interesting and interesting work is to think. Special effects are also amazing. Gary Stretch is really interesting as an actress and good looking. He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. John Rhys-Davies is amazing if he is normal. He is one of the greatest actors of our time. With Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is the best and perfect for the leading woman, even making an English emphasis and remarkable achievement. I have found that the film has won many awards, and I can see why. <br /> <br /> All in all of this is an incredible independent film. Watch for sure. <br /> <br /> I recommend very much. And give TEN + !!!
