Dana Andrews stands "Where the End End Continues" in this 1950 movie that also star Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays Detective Sgt of New York City. Mark Dixon, an angry officer who has experienced problems in the past by beating suspects. When a person is killed at a farmer's gambling club, Scale (Merrill), Dixon and his partner are going to investigate. Scalia claims Ken Ken's murder (Stevens), who has now gone to the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney) but was affected. Dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result of the farmer's men. He is going to see Paine and, without realizing he has a plate of his head from the war, he takes the floor and he doesn't know to kill him. Now he should cover the murder. If more trouble, he falls to Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after seeing that Paine had found her daughter, has been arrested for a crime. This is a dark black, with a colorful brain with a beautiful display. The beautiful and tolerant Andrews are convincing as a tough but contentious warrior who needs to stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The movie connects to its cost of "Laura", Gene Tierney, and seems to be as good as a model and bad taste for men who seem to be used. What? He little knows, he has another on his hands. Ken Tully works very hard like his father, who complains that he is innocent despite some evidence of destruction. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this directed, fast-moving and sucking film is the end. Hollywood clean and, putting yourself in Tierney's place, I doubt that I would like to respond to the same way. Minor criticism of the film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not get as afraid as "Laura," but a few things here on earth are. If you love film films, this is a must-see.
