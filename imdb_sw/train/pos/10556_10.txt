I didn't know what to expect but I am glad I went to see this. Comedy smart, little happens that makes you think. I did not know exactly how the director could create "anything", but leave it to Mr. Natali and skilled people at C.O.R.E. create a set under budget which looks real (as real as nothing can be). This value of your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You will be glad you did.
