It wins: the cage in heaven is a bomb. The mission is as powerful as its new work and clean, wonderful and flying pirates how it can be better! The art is quite amazing and sound, which is often used after this, (I don't know if this is the first time I have heard it) and it makes me feel a sense of feeling of the sound of film. Sheeta, a female guide in this movie is quite amazing with a boy, Pazu is also a good example-living alone! The program is common Miyazaki. I will not give you away, but the end is very good. This is one of the best of Miyazaki and Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you would like to look down Under Moving Time when it comes out (sometimes next year I'm hoping) If you would like Miyazaki to look at this one easily in USA. Enjoy, Piper A
