I first saw it back to the 90s on the British TV, I did so but I lost the chance to wipe it, many years passed but the film always stuck with me and I lost hope to see TV again, the main thing that had ended and I was last, The part of the castle of the pit touches me really, it seems easy to see, it has a beautiful story, good music, the list goes on and on, it's okay to say it's good but everyone will take yourself Best bits away from them once they have seen, yes animation is up and good looking , it shows its age in a very small part but it has now become part of the beauty, I am very happy to have come to the DVD as one of my top 10 films of all time. Buying or leasing only to see, looking well at night alone and drinking and food gets so you don't get the film off. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
