Does anyone know where or how can I get a copy of this film? !! I've been looking for a long time, someone's help! Back to 1997 my girlfriends and I were extra on this Long Island based film, and in fact we didn't see it. : I hope I could get a copy in some way I could finally look at it, and share it with girls! Is there anyone out there who knows where to find a copy of this, so I can stop driving myself (also, no matter if it is in the VHS format, I'm still in the ice age itself.) If you, or anyone you know, have a copy of this film please help, I would be willing to pay a good copy!
