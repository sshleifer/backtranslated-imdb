Dick Tracy is the best film of the comic book presented so far. Movie feels similar to the comic book, progressively credible with color scheme. The series of Batman rose, fallen, rose and fallen again. Dick Tracy has the power to stay true as something that adults and children can enjoy. Good people win over evil, without blood and gore to find out. Al Pacino is doing a good job of dealing with Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is remembered as Breathless. But the best work is Warren Beatty who just writes Dick Tracy as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can't wait until the release on DVD on 2 April 2002, my tape is thin.
