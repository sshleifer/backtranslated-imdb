Oh, those who are not worried about Italy. It was not the first time they put the film on the source items without permission or knowledge, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is Italian but has been done in the early days of the movie, especially because they often thought they would be able to overcome it. James M. Cain's publishers were able to put this film away from the US screens until 1976 but however the movie itself has grown slightly in classic known. <br /> <br /> Movie is not good to look like 1946 American version but it's a great movie however. This of course is not because it is a movie is a great powerful story, that's exciting and offers movie with certain characters and originality. It follows a novel close to it and therefore it is similar to other films of its own story, and really as a variation that is installed in the Italian environment. Leave it to Italy for films about life and real people in it. These original performances always have a real impression on it and therefore also involves looking at. Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power towards the end, when the movie began to feel for a long time and pull part. Films could easily finish 15 minutes before. However, I don't have anything else about this film. It is just very much done, according to the powerful materials and the same sources. Before the first interesting for Luchino Visconti, who continued to lead many interesting and very interesting Italian movies / / <br /> 8/10
