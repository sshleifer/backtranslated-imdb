Recently I started watching this show, and I must say that it made me laugh. You should be aware of false things, with everything else. Some people said this show should have more impact on the dead, among other things. If you are going to admit that Ned can bring the dead to the resurrection, you should accept that the other bits of the full show. I could not help exciting after each period I looked at. In fact I think it's good there to show out there that can take a very strange lesson and actually make it a great look. I absolutely love the story, I think it adds to that extraordinary extra show. You can not always compare the old performances with the author to his new, you should take everything as your tool. Definitely give a chance, and just enjoy part of ignorance as they are.
