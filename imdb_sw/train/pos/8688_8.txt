The most common story of Columbo which was actually the first part of the series of a series of long series but was the second to be infected (after "Killed by the Book"). Robert Culp makes the first three exhibitions as a guest killer in a series and plays the owner of a private detective agency, who says a wife (Patricia Crowley) of a rich, influential businessman (played for mercy and Ray Milland) after deleting the report, on his behalf, after discovering he had something. Later the wife rebel against the heroic plan but he is killed with a pleasant anger .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfactory place in many ways, especially if a plot has been put in place and is finally developed as well as because of small links Columbo that crime is an unexpected murder. One thing is increasingly increasingly when the widow is using the murderer to help Columbo in her investigation: a feature that makes many good events, especially in the first sequence when the three intermediate actors and Columbo's great deception are amazing. Guided by flair by Bernard L. Kowalski and acting on the highest level of right, this actually put a tone to the entire series (since "Kill for Book" was down and end end). Script and collaborators of Columbo Richard Levinson and William Link are correct, well done and properly considered and emphasized by a steady, efficient and meaningful instruction which actually shows the uncertainty of the story. Finally, finally shows that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. Overall, this is a very good piece of spying work for Columbo, and it shows very much that the production team has worked well and efficiently to give the story of the beaten Columbo story.
