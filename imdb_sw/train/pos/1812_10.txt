This is one of the biggest movies perhaps even the largest movie ever. I forgot about the movie for 12 years. Until I saw an increase on TV for ADGTH and allowed memory records when I was a little child. And when I watched it last night I had gone to a drug. I usually do not like family animation movies but this is a special movie for the family. The end of the movie touches my heart all the time and is very frustrating but that's what makes this movie more interesting than all the trash that comes to children's movies today. I mean that the movie is G and refers to 2 dogs who are involved with gambling, there are many cigarettes, drinking, killing, death and hell shown on the film. Which I believe makes the film good until good. I mean movies today do not bring the truth to children and in this film they did. RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
