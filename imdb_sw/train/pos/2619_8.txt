If the King of Lion was the Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3: No Matata is the Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead. Just like Tom Stoppard's film, we get to see a step from the view of two small characters from nature: Timon, a horned player to break a song on a drop of hats, and Pumbaa, Warthog and ignore issues. By following their story - instead of Lion - we see why all the animals stuck as the Lion was presented from Pride Rock. We see what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow the Lion behind the Pride Rock to remove it. And we see how they were involved and once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets a lot of better jokes, but is used by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg playing their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their voices different to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only obstacle is a stop-start-back-fast device that doesn't always help develop stories. After saying this, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the film. By laughing more than any three-in-Disney-series movie, No Matata is worth checking - if only for a hot tub event that is still funny though that little bit predictable.
