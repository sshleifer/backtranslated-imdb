Can I be simple and first in my evaluation if I just say "I liked"? It's amazing for bits, it has beautiful stars and it's nice to watch. The songs (there are two of which are often asserted) are forgetful, but they find a pleasant health treat (such as Mr Fairbanks very good at the Wagnerian version of the Miss Grable tender bouquet provided only); there is no more play with all 1861 cords created around Miss Grable, and the comedy can be a heavy burden, but the results are still very stressful. Photography (including real outdoor shots which are exciting) are amazing, playing around with different shades of heavy gold. Miss Grable is a little more of her talent and pleasant side, but it's still clean and beautiful in this council of "umrie worlde". It is very similar to the "Under the World" line with Rita Hayworth, and that tends to be unpopular. So I think several people will see the "Woman in Ermine" for a short and favorite time. But it's a story of a story, and these have a direct move on a certain angle. My opinion is - we enjoy the artwork, dress, script of magic and everything else this film should give, and stop complaining. The film is released on DVD in Germany, with both German and English soundtrack.
