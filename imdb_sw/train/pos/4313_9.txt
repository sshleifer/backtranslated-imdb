The Grand Canyon is located below a very small group: it is a very clever film, and a very clever dialogue with food ideas everywhere from beginning to end. I have a feeling that it has never made it suitable for the title (and never will be), because of the convenience. This type of flick requires sensitive audience. Anger thought that IMDb made me write ten lines, because this is not appropriate in any case in this case. In addition to fulfilling this request, I will tell you that the weak stage of the film if any is in acting: it's not that bad but it could be done better. The experience was done by Kevin Kline who was perfect. Continue and watch.
