Death's death runs like a game into a movie about who has done to whom, as it actually happens with a single set. The cluster is that an effective actor, whose star is falling, receives a great artwork from an old student and thus isolates himself from blocking his play, and his protest (his) wife's wife. Or so you think, for the first half of the film. The preliminary mark of the half, the death of the death begins to throw us into an astonishment that turns the top of his head, then around, and then to spin, all the time to keep his head right. It's a good movie hidden by wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a senior sports actress, who loves himself in this film - a little seat with a very popular Brit. There is no surprise here - he does his usual good work. He gets the best of Deathtrap, which he does perfectly: "Is your definition of success, being a group of friends in the government jail?" Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, tries to play and play in the amazing amazing performance of playing a proud (and psychopathic) player of the boy. He also gets to show his body of toned, which must continue to come from Superman movies. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have participated in another film which is one of my favorite competitions - Noises Off. It also refers to talking too, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They join the comic warriors of the comic Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Visitors). Together, they show the disasters that occur on the bed bed with the players of play. On the face, the movie seems to be a slapstick but on the look you find that it is most jokes jokes that require more than one look to catch. You want this low-hit film found on DVD.
