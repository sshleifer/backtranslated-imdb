I enjoyed this film very much.Tobey Maguire gives a great performance like Jake. He should be one of the best actors who I have seen. And I was surprised there were many lines of humor in the film. He was very good for this although I have never seen him give a comic line before. The movie gives you a share with the characters and actually makes you wonder what is all about. I didn't know what to expect from the performance of the jewel but I think it did well. Many exciting things. Very good trips. I am a fan of Maguire. See Cider House Rules. One of the Best Best Ever.
