I first saw the BLOOD SAMURAI at the first time during the Hawaii Film Festival. WOW! Blood just threw it away from his conscience, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, run completely, and even more than a year, and all in FUN MGU! Especially for those who enjoy all Japanese samurai and ninja associations, YOU CAN MAKE THE WORLD!
