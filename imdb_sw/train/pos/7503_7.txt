The film was the same, quite entertaining. The cast was very good, and I will witness what the comments before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was good and he alone is reason enough to watch this film. Played a selfish friend of "evil" with the port manager for beauty! <br /> <br /> There are many songs made by "More Gravity" in this film, but this does not come as a surprise based on the film is the VH1 production. However, if a rock / rock music is not for someone who loves a person who can also like to walk with those events. The band plan is trying to make it on LA but but to win many obstacles in the way is not the original, but the most entertaining, and some amazing plot comes back here and there.
