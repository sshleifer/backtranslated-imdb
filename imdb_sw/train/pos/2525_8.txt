Tony Hawk Underground came at a time when the series was starting to lose its luster, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live according to expectations and left in fact really on air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with a series that would have been different and interesting. Under the ground introduced a story, which was so cold because it made the whole world to fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another feature created which fans liked so much and that they were able to turn off the skateboard, which is good because now you can really climb, run, and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> Rates are good, Neversoft has also improved on the issue that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the height of the level structures. The first two PS1, N64 and Dreamcast games were good because the levels were good and small with some of the secrets in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of the smaller features added and actually restricted to those systems are also their boundaries. In this version, they summarized these elements, there are not many local people, in fact there is almost no even at a certain level, and graphics and skating screens are thrown down but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game has one console, the storymode is short shorter, of course this is Neversofts the first time to do it with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so understandable. However, since you say you will finish this game within a day. Overall, the addition to which was very enjoyable.
