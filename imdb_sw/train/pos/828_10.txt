I found that the new HOPA and METAL RECORDS are in TOP 10, but that this has never been in TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation for Ewoks, but there are many reasons for this film. Han Solo Rescue from Jabba: This specialist has swung Han Solo in a field that was founded when we met a character in A NEW Hope. <br /> <br /> - The King was Finally Revealed: Alright this can not work also now that prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the King as children. <br /> <br /> - Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, so this was special effects time. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all films! Section 3: 1) War of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts His Father & Falling King 3) Destruction of Second Death Star (Late Time) The Final and Military Festival: As I said, this movie gets a lot of cotton because of Ewoks but I think it's a cool type that when the whole galaxy celebrates the KINGDOM KINGDOM, our heroes have their own party in the forest for each other. All of this was the end of the last chapter for our heroes and the right end to the story of STAR war.
