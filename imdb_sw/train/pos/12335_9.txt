Warning: consists of a spoiler. Corny plot and in most cases acting severe. Fontaine is good, but others, especially Richard Ney, the husband of Ivy, is very timber. Ney is lying in bed, dying of arsenical poison, and every existing hair. However, the movie is juicy and so it has witnessed very much. Most faithful in the book than many movies of his time. Giving Joan Fontaine as a pastor (and a prostitute, which was just amazing then - not sand, children) was a stroke. He is his usual Joan Fontainey himself. As the killers required, he dies to fall "feet in front of the floor inside empty space."
