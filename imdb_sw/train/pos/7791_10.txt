One of these films you hear from friends (... or read about IMDb). Not many false information in this one. I could see almost everything here happening to the little girl running from the last home town in Tennessee to Florida, with all her earthly property in an old car. <br /> <br /> Heroine, Ruby, makes a lie to start, but learns from them. I found myself wondering why, why didn't depend on Mike's shoulder, but ... he has his reasons, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> It's just a good film. The only thing I didn't like very much about it, I think, is the head.
