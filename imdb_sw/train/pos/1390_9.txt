If you like 70 worship of Sci-fi in the way I do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" than you like this. It is an understanding of Sci-fi's 70-lucky, including the 22th century junkyard and the World millions years since now. This movie is clean 70. Keep Steve Miller's "Fly Like Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon" and you're ready to go!
