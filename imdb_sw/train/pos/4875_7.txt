"Father is still off the business" was the head of the post after "Give me this promise" first in Cannes. I understand why many think the same and unique expression of Kusturica is still in its new movie and it is something that critics cannot touch. I had two hours of fresh energy without rest. Even when Kusturica faces a lack of accumulation or fear of empty space is still unique and unsuitable. The good performance of Stribor Kusturica. Much more close to the slightly less theme in "Life is Miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a world-class woman, please do not lose. Indeed, I recommend to everyone to see this film.
