Boys are working outside the recording studio when they hear the "angel's voice." This would be Miss Van Doren, struggling to go under Miss Andrews's name because her father does not admit to being "radio singer". However, he hopes a leader, Ms Biby, a friend of his father will use him, and then he deserves his approval. He / she stops but for a while the boys run amok in a studio caused by having other musicians out of killing them after destroying the recording session. Finally things are quiet. "Whew, we have pointed them," says Moe. "Well, we have left, too," Curly answers. The boys are pushing around the studio, keeping a record of Miss Van Doren and Curly wearing women's clothes and pretending to sing. Mrs Biby walks in, fascinating and employs "Seniorita Cucacha" there! For $ 500 extra, he has been asked to come and sing at the top community of the night. Others, as they say, are history as curly pretending to be an opera singer and other wonderful results. Oh, by the way, she accompanied by "Mucho Senior" and "Gusto's Senior." What is happening at the party is that only the truth succeeds, but not before the antics of a few slapstick occur. For all, a very good place. I enjoyed but I did not resist anything special.
