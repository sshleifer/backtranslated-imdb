I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary (in English). It appears in Cambodia (the English headlines in the language says that the character speaks Thai but the film says Cambodia) a bad strong man raises boys to use hunger and teach them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill other people in China and during the killing of a lover's partner is killed. The Wai offender is a sufficient principle who is worried about his father who is also a bullet who was shot and in coma. Wai's head is a friend of his father and is worried about Wai's tendency to lose. He does not know Wai who took his father in dealing with drug traffickers and beat him and put him in a coma. Pang runs and hides in the basket of a basket basket where he meets a woman who came here to tell his mother and he keeps repeating her father not letting him go (Pang can't speak Chinese and he does not know this but saves her from a father who seems to have sex with him perhaps this is why Cat III). Wai becomes more and more focusing on getting Pang but Pang is almost fail. Even after Pang robbed the boat and took the woman to his home where they were married and become pregnant they followed and joined the evil man (who teaches boys) to make a plan to fight and learn to get Pang. There is a great mix between Wai and Pang and a woman who is a bully who is a major victim and stops Wai is dead and Pang has hit her child from a dead mother and left her as a young man who can rise to be a murderer. This film has been photographed with good voice sounds. There are many brutal cases of violence. A woman with a long nail took out her leg. Then with neck and torso. Guns are driven directly to the head. And beaten with several edge. It may be very serious and fall but it is obvious to see.
