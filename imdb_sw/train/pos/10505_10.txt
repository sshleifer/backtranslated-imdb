Yes, that's true, it's. I fully believe that the N64 and the weird controller were all designed so that this game can be made. It was a wonderful first time I saw it, with its enormous environment and colorful characters, and its amazing now. The control of the play is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that Nintendo charm which is always non-visible but of course there. You must have any N64 owner, and the reason for getting N64 for everyone else.
