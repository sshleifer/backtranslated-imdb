What is most troubling about this film is not that school killings are reduced as the fact is shown, but the fact is that it happens with young people like Cal and Andre ... ordinary children with ordinary families. Using the Blair Witch's camera method, Ben Coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have certain issues with secondary school, although we are not told exactly what causes these issues. They seem to be an example - many people hate high school, why? The part of you just does not believe that they will carry out the murder on the day of Zero. The secrets of surveillance cameras at school during bullets are made more powerful for that reason. You can't believe it really happens, and that's actually happened. The hand-held camera also makes the illusion that this is not a written movie, a brilliant idea that is involved.
