This is not the best film of Bela Lagosi, but it has a good old fashion model for the 40 fun entertainment. The brides leave the dead on the altar as rivers. I think I would like to postpone the wedding until after the fiend cut, but it's a terrible movie, so I think people ignore the risk for some reason. However, Lagosi is a mad doctor, who needs female female blood to put her old, sick and healthy wife. Always loses Keystone Cops to hide bodies in the hearse (who would think of looking for a corpse in the hearse?), And grandmothers continue to find. It is not a movie like this would be perfect without the female writer of Lois Lane who wants to capture the offender. Good in resolving crime, bad in keeping his mouth at any wrong time, I think who Lagosi takes the second defendant. I love the "haunted house" where Lois Lane gets handkerchiefs and rainfall as a guest at Lagosi headquarters. Hidden ways, wife of vampire, bad pastor Igor assistant, and so on. Good materials. It really pacing continues to the film moving, and the story is involved in a normal but satisfactory way. If you like old horror movies, this is worth watching.
