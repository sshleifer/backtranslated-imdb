basically, I love the Verhoeven film because in his film, I enjoy the good story of pscychosexual which I have previously seen in the "Primary Foundation". It's really amazing that I enjoyed so much.so it's obvious to me to watch this other movie Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Well, it's his previous direction before his block block hit "Basic Instinct" and since I was very curious to watch that movie and yes, the movie has completed my hopes and expectations. This movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant drama of pscychosexual which is a little hard for some listeners. The story of this movie is about a gay writer called "Reve" (Krabbe), a drunken man who lives by his own values ​​and sees many visions that can show him from a future accident. After the end of his speech, he introduced a fraudulent woman named "Christine", who has an incredible history she does not want to open.To have sex with her at home if she is a teenager.next morning, she look sexy, boyfriend's boyfriend's pictures on The table, the person she met the center has a desire to meet her and tell Christine to invite her to her home. I don't want to open the whole story because it's the movie Verhoeven and the end of the film is amazing! <br /> <br /> especially, I would like the "Reve" character played by brilliant and "Krabbe" basically as its acting because if a gay person I am fully identified with his character and yes I like his charming face. I would like to thank Mr.Verhoeven to make the black comedy like that. <br /> <br /> I tested this movie: 10 out of 10.
