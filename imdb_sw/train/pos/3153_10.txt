I will do this short and sweet because I don't think there is so much that you can tell someone about this show who has never seen an exceptional hilariously funny and unique, for me the possibility of a funniest show ever. You should look at it to really understand his humor and take me many times to get in but once you can't get back. For example how Hydes's behavior always wants to see his friends be in a lot of different kinds of funnier happens. <br /> <br /> All of the classic classic I mean cast, authors, director, is just a successful recipe. One fan I think is the hardest time is Ashton Kutcher but I mean he's the head of this show I don't think it's possible for Kelso's behavior to play with anyone else, it takes a very intelligent person to play a stupid person. All the main characters are better and can not be worth during the inspection if I have never mentioned the fox of the cold stone Mila Kunis, now it's spicy to meet the ball when it is unsuitable beside the show show.
