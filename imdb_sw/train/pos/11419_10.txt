The beginning of Claire Denis is one of the most confident and confident. In this manifestation of life towards the end of French colonization of Cameroon, she looks at the relationship between men and women, black and white. And the black servant 'Prot√©e' as the basic object of the passion and repression film, the film enters the realm of the original from the beginning. Denis builds a picture of life through a series of behavioral relationships that sets the viewer on the screen. Mood's film is fully taken with the function of the camera and (missing) lights. <br /> <br /> Good discussion.
