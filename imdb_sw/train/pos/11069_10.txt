"Ah Ritchie made another film of gangster and Statham" thought the average fan, expecting another Stock Snatch / Lock; expect perhaps a few changes of time, but none of them very difficult "me and young" swallow after a few beer. Ah, look, you need to watch this film. There are no tea cups, no extra food sauce from the counter, no "keep running" when you scream for a fridge - see the film! There is no more laughter than those who can get away from the bigger violence (and if you lock your boat, be it) but a really good direction, good conversation, and good performances. <br /> <br /> My popularity - Big Pussy from Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
