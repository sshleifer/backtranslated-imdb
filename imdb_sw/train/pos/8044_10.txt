First, this is the only funniest movie I saw. Includes a slapstick of full time, sexual humor, and stand-to-maneuver-up. But it goes beyond that. Souler's opposition is the original story of love (something we do not often see) that gives me hope that there is love out there, that two people who love each other can work through their trouble; and that comedic such take life (something I believe we all should be) can be accepted by people who are very important. Chris Meloni gives a convincing performance like Barry Singer that he should win oscar. The movie is beautifully written and I hope we will see more films from everyone involved in the future.
