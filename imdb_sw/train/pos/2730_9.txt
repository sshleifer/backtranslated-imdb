I saw this in the theater during the release of the original and it was disturbing then if I am sure it will still be. It was the first part of '68 and this was still making a circuit in many cities in America and there was recently mass murder in my town where I found this where someone continued to shoot. The beauty of the event close to the house with this true story made for the exhibition of destructive exhibitions. It really made the life of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was studying with a novel derived from the real event by Truman Capote and the screenplay and the direction of Richard Brooks removed the event and the Truman interpretation in response to the tackle of the spectacular movies. Music from Quincy Jones effectively is a story. I've seen this just twice since. It was very real. Almost like being a witness of crime itself and riding with murderers. I would like to give this 9.0 possible possible 10. The organization is dealt with strongly by violence and crime today that this seems to be slow and spread and can be viewed with little impact but for anyone more than 50 this will be a mark of investigators of psyche criminals.
