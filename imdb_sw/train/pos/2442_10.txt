This movie is close to the Irish side that Americans do not see the size, the little religious side affected by the citizens of 'the world's most friendly'. The movie, by the entry of the inhabitants of Fethard who are old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (although they insist that the film producers invented some of the most violent events for spice up action) <br /> <br /> The movie was not recommended very much in Ireland as it shows the Catholic church for bad light, but the simple fact is that the representatives of the Catholic church * performed * a few vetoes (before Protestants were Jews). The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland
