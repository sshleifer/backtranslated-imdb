At first I saw this "film" I liked. When I was 11, I was attracted to music and dancing. I've been an old man, I've been more interested in doing too. Although the first half is just the work of Michael (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still fun to watch. The sequence of "Badder" could be left, although the children were good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Peke" were funny, especially when a police officer tells Michael, "I need your autograph here", after stopping him playing in the play area. But "Smooth Criminal" is icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a good job as a problem (and the hair was wild). Dancing is perfect, and so is a special effect. The only thing I could do without spiders. Any fan of Michael should see this, if you have never been. I have 10+!
