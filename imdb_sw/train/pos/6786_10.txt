Ronald Colman gives adequate performance as Tony John, Broadway actor who cannot separate his offstage life from Othello Shakespeare, a character playing in action .... Two key events show Tony's problem. The first is done in the office of manufacturers of Max Lasker. Working is a matter of talent for Lasker committed to working. But Donlan, Tony's friend, disagree: "No, no. When you do that like Tony does it, it's a lot more. The way he has to be someone every night ... so completely. The whole system is not affected by it." .. Another area occurs in the apartment of Pat Kroll. Tony tells him his name is Martin. Thanks. Then he says: "Or Paul, Hamlet Joe. And maybe Othello." .... When Tony begins to say Othello, we learn that although he tries to put his real life separately from his life stage, "The starting point begins in your life, and the war begins. Truth against thought." Pat's mind is Desdemona and she is Othello, and she believes that she really believes. He murders .... The Colman's braille function, in a difficult and complicated role, gave him a 1947 Academy Award for Actor Best. Oscar's selection went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. It should not be ignored by Milton Krasner's atomipheric movies.
