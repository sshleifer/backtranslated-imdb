Stoic and Laconic army Sergeant Todd (good and reliable performance with Kurt Russell has been reduced to a remote remote planet after being seen as a sick and arrogant Colonel Mekum (interested in a small hil and Jason Isaacs), who Todd and his fellow soldiers were replaced by high-level planners. Todd joins the ragtag community of peace and self-reliance and has to protect this community when new soldiers arrive for field practice. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, who works from a powerful and stimulating script by David Webb Peoples, shows a fascinating vision of the possibility of winter, cold and hard as possible next to the future when maintaining speed and severe, powerful stress. In addition, Anderson deals with the movement of humanity well (Todd's struggle to communicate with his overcrowded emotions is actually true) and measures to stimulate interesting events and exciting gusto. Russell gives the power and amazement around the image of Todd's pantomime; he expresses a lot of emotions without saying much and instead he does a lot of work through his body movements and face words. The Bang-up assistant returns with Jason Scott Lee as a military soldier of Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as a gentle gentleman, Jared and Taylor Thorne as a young boy Nathan, Gary Busey as a former war farmer , Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as a wise mayor Hawkins. Best of all, this film makes big and important information about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical ability. David Tattersall's movie physician, the orchestra of Joel McNeely, and the first level of special effects increases the quality of the best sterling of science fiction / hybrid performance.
