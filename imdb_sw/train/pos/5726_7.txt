"Raw" is a remake of Shimizu's series of famous Japanese movie trailers. Shimizu knows he does not deal with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person will do in his place: he forgot the logic and focuses on giving the audience a fun journey. He uses known clich√©s related to spirit stories but Shimizu plays with these things through thinking. Non-physical stories are not only gimmick but an exciting way of presenting a process from a different perspective. Finally, all I can say is that if the sole purpose of a terrible film is to disturb the audience (in the same way as the comedy is to make people laugh), this film succeeded with flying colors. I looked at the theater and the audience and it was fun to see the audience as they were wild on this. Maybe it doesn't play well in your bedroom.
