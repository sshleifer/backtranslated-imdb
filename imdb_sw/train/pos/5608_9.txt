Indeed, he got uneven after this film, but from the "Knife In Water" until "Planner", Roman Polanski can always be counted to give something interesting and unique. Despite many fighting themes (exclusion, paranoia), no two films are identical. The story of this is similar to "respond" to himself since the last decade, but the voice is quite different. "Planner" can balance the dark than the darkness of the darkness (I am trying to hit the narrative, although strange characters and regular conversation is funny) and a certain paranoia of course. Polanski was always a master in building deficit, and while in this film is almost without surprising. The film competition is also included. In addition to the Polanski guide as a general direction, all others sent by workers provide a great contribution. The polanski actor is often covered by the Polanski director, but his performance here attracts its uncomfortable characters and worries. The theme of social discrimination makes this film more cautious because it is strange. All others offer strong performances too, especially to turn to the mercy of Isabelle Adjani, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters' to suppress. "Planner" is often reduced because of how people already beat the reputation on both "Repulsion" and "Baby Rosemary", but it's as brilliant as one of those classic. (9/10)
