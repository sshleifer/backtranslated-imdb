If you would like to see a variety of films, if you feel Love in your heart, even if you have lost the Lord, this film makes you think. Although Georges is a mental disability, you can see the last mind at the end, when love gives you the instructions not the brain. I am not emotional, but this film makes you humiliate. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my faith. Sometimes foreign films are more interesting, but there are not enough ads to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (Mark of God) and Majid Majidi is another example of foreign movies, close to the same taste.
