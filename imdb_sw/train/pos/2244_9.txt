The only information I can explain is why this film is not very available because it faces close to home. This movie was a real surprise, satire is a professional. This film allows lighting in the darkness that has been organized by the religious and massive media, and roaches appear on the lid. Use the DVD and watch for yourself if you have never been, this film is successful where many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to put the nose under the tent, all by using moisture and analogies with cunning as well as telling them back and places. Can not comment in detail without revealing some of the destroyers, there are some surprises in this film that even buff of the planned film will be taken away from.
