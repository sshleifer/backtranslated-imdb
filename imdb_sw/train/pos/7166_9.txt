Holo, novel, was forced to me in the course of education. I didn't think I would like a children's novel; together, two other books that I had to study in class were very bad. But, to my surprise, I really liked Holes. In fact it is one of the most well-written novels I've ever read. I think it has a common quality that makes appeal to young people before, young, and adults. Everyone who reads, I think, will go the best man. While I can't say quite well about the film, I am glad to say that they have found it more. I don't think the audience of the film will go as far as wealth, but they will certainly enjoy it, without the side effect being stupider while sitting. It is a story of mind, and it is very well expressed. I think it causes tad very quickly. This book takes more time to develop characters. And flashbacks come with out very quickly that they don't have much time to register. Tribal Romance in the past is more heard and comprises than in the novel. And finally, connecting all loose fibers, it seems to be very stupid. It's similar to a novel, but there is a sense of ignorance that doesn't exist in the film. It works best. I also don't like a lot of pop songs. I wish Disney didn't feel it is important to sell voice sounds. Sent it to the best-board better, from young children to former benefits. Jon Voight is very big. Not quite sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze, though. 9/10.
