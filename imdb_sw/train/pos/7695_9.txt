Good Times was an interesting comedy on the first nuclear black family living on Chicago projects. Whether or not, you live in local cities, ghettos, neighborhoods, or rural areas, this show is still a treasure to watch and focus on the family that only family rather than show about the poor black families. But they do not live on it. They have a sense of humor and have a strong family values ​​and values. Despite the story behind the events, this show was worth putting on the air unless I didn't like them to kill the father which I agreed with Esther Rolle who won so hard that the family together. But despite all the fights behind the events, the Best Times was a show about the family. We all liked the power of JJ and its antics. We watched Janet Jackson's Penny raised a little. This view was proving to show a passion for drugs, gangs, and alcoholism. Without preaching, Evans always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to leave the ghetto.
