I found my good part of the comedy movies and stand but this is original, so clean, it will make you wonder why you always walk right in the video store. Murphy has a good joke of radicy but this is very funny to pass. If only movies can be this funny. should be called "107 minutes of the most amazing comedy" Murphy is a comic specialist in this film and will make you say "this is the man who made dr doulittle!" He speaks of a man of ice, a shoe throwing mother, aunt and mustache, racism, and everything else that you can think of and those you have not. Please if you have seen one comedy in your life this is, if only all the movies can be delirious.
