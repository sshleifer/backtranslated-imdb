This is one of the spiritual movies I have ever seen. I came with about 150 people to St George and we saw this film at the St. George Temple. There was no one who had dry eyes in the audience. Also, there were other religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the interesting music and the comparison of the founders' stories and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. <Br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the problems that the pioneers were experiencing. After all, it's far from American History.
