Four good stories from master Robert Bloch, have been done with screens and the best actors in the field in the early seventy years, are the basis of this excellent Amicus production. This was the most popular type of film in sixty to mid-seventy and is one of my favorite movies of awesome movies. This mainly shines with Sweets for the Sweet part, where Christopher Lee is mentioned by his little girl little girl, heiress for her mother's tradition. Enjoy very much from the beginning to the end, and very good is also another third place (with end end to the comic side, but with a great addition to Ingrid Pitt, the most popular vampress of English movies.
