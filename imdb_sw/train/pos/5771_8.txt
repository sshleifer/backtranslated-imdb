This is one of those movies that occur when you enter the Saturday afternoon, and you get into it and finish watching the whole thing. I thought it had been done well and made me feel the characters. Although it is moving slowly, taking into account the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and members of their family, it was not boring. We don't see so much of all the trophies that were legends, and instead many of the bullets happen when they are beaten by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, did a good job with her character. Departure from a beautiful country girl to a bloodthirsty killer is a challenge to explain, and I enjoyed the trick that brought in the role. Overall, the above effort, especially considering it was made for TV film.
