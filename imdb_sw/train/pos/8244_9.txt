Loved it! What? Not like? - you have your grandson, you have your zombies, you have your family problems, you have your social problems, you have found yourself a Good Body of Retro-1950-Body from Under Danger Put in the Bay For Unasy Top. You can't ask for more. <br /> <br /> Cast is very good. Carrie Ann Moss is perfectly perfect as a woman's house of woman planting. He is both the bride, and the legal murder. A friend's dream. K'sun is so great as a child tries to be as common as possible in the existence of this dream, and somehow succeed. He is a real presence of screens. Very photogenic, and nature. Without calling them all, the rest is interesting. Henry Czerny makes the police of suspicion and you respect the little squeamishness as if it is a daily routine. Billy Connolly is as happy as Fido. Good actor: I would like to have the role of head in "Braveheart," and lead Gibson. My feeling is that William Wallace would be closer to the real character. His fido is released, still available. Good touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a great and wonderful poke in ethics, values, social pinnings, emotions, growing, coping with uncertain timing, and adjustment to compensation for impossible conditions. Realistic appearance.
