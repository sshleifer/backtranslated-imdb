Steven Speilberg's change of the Alice Walkers popular report is not part of the controversy. At first the black community members criticized their treatment of black men, while others questioned why the white man was leading this film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a black sandwich named Celie, growing in rural America after the turn of the century. He has two children and his abusive father who is beaten from his hands at birth. His only discipline in his sad life comes from his sister. Celie (played in later years with a player who has found Whoopie Goldberg) is married to a strong husband (Danny Glover). The man is abused by the sister and is thus quickly removed from the Celie life. The story is often shocking as Celie believes she can reunite with her sister and her children. In his life he meets the balance of characters, including Sophia, tough as a nail wife for his first child, and Shug, a great singer and luscious saloon, who teaches him something or two about love. The direction of Speilberg is on this picture, which offers brilliant displays and some stellar displays. I find you to watch this film and do not enter it! The color film can capture the essence of the difficult story. Although it reduces lesbians and African stories, all that was very clear in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, and lets the voice of Alice Walker shine. I can't start responding to the debate around this film. It is worth mentioning, however, this is one of the few films that I can watch from time to time, and that has left unacceptable marks. <br /> <br />
