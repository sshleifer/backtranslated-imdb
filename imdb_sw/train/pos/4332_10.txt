Paul Reiser did an amazing job by writing this movie. Peter Falk gives his life performance. It is worthy of the Academy Award. This was one of the most interesting and annual movies. Reiser's wit is wonderful and he is as good as it gets and if he was in his long TV sitcom "Mad about You". Peter Falk did a good job as his father, and Peter who is now 78 years old made us laugh and cry at the same time. Assistance was the same as the work especially good Elizabeth Perkins. You must see the film in 2005. We realize that everyone for all ages and religion will love this movie and somehow it relates to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and brothers like these in movies. We all had good and bad times together and we wanted things were the same but different.
