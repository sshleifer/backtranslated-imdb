The danger of Reunion is a very full of comedy. It was 1982 and the 1972 class of Lizzie Borden High is coming back for the next 10 years, among them are common habits, hunk, babe, oil and nerd etc., but old students love all night, one of their classmates is Walter. Baloer, the wimp class who were under the comedy prank and the other class on graduation night and since it has been in the house of intelligence, Walter is running and now plans to revenge, ,, <br /> <br /> Though Cluster of darkness, this is only true excuse for lots of delightful lots and pieces of set. Saying more could damage the film but if you enjoyed the Naked Gun & Birds movies you would like this, and what other film is offered by the music of the College Berry? A good comedy that deserves a broad audience.
