This is a complex document that shows many things about the early life of Gay. Setting to view was when Gay was the word used for homo-sex revolution, and not Gay as a descriptor. Or are they still used in the same way today? I believe many parts of the film come from circa 1968 to 1989. It was opened in 1993, so it has been around. <br /> I was touched by the records of the love of one person more than 20 odd a year. Love is shown in ways that only true love can be. There are many incidents of amazing understanding and pain, as well as fun and fun events. There are life events like homo-sex and life as gay. The film itself was a work of love, and I believe it is a diamond. The young person comes out of this film to understand the negative effects of AIDS. When I write this, I think about how this movie appears to me to be installed. The development of medical science, politics, and social and culture held since this film was installed (15 years ago) is amazing. However, obviously, in the case of AIDS itself, we do not do it yet. Heck I think we were not made to all limits. <br /> <br /> However, it's just a good good idea. I would like to encourage anyone who feels that they do not understand the life of homosexuals, homosexuals, or AIDS damage to watch this film.
