One of my films "inside" films. I don't know if anyone in our country has not seen this film! It's funny, and sad at times ... I don't know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) accept this film, because you know at some point in our history of Serbian and Serbian behavior in the first half of the 20th century, so understand it! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who looked at it ... and loved it. I think I will try to put all parameters from the film on this site, but first to know how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
