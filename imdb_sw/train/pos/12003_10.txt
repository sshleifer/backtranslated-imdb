If you change in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can in my history of the new religion. I was supposed to attend this film with my children and other young people and women and their family members. In the evening of the evening, we drove Kirtland, Ohio to the historic village of the church. We were saved at the Vistor station to see this film. Since my look at the film is available for only a few church documents, I was surprised. The only pictures of the "length of the church" I saw were "Heritage" and "My Best Years", which I thought were well written and framed. At the beginning, a missionary read the tissue and said that several people had been moved so much to tears with this movie. I thought "Well ... but it takes a lot to add me to tears." Imagine my surprise when I found myself looking! Certainly it is an exciting and exciting covenant for the Prophet Joseph Smith. Look and believe his powerful message!
