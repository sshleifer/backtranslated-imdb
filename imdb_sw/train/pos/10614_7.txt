Three girls (female media ministers, including the actress Barbara Bach, not below) visit a small town to reach a concert, ending rental rooms in the house should avoid as a blow. A good little player, a little sadness from a dialogue that has a priority and a line of thin plot (which doesn't work so well in hiding his secrets). One basic topic compares completely (such as harvest yield equipment), and this is exactly the ongoing film. Exhibitions and movies are more beautiful than par (compared to many other 70 years / 80 films), but what makes me love this film is the lowest place in the lowest environment. From the time the "Keller Junior character" was established, his performance made my jaw open and did not close to the end of the film. Very good to see the actress Sydney Lassick (who was funkoily wacko in the "One nest on Cuckoo's nest", and now quite demented in "The Unseen") to take one of the leading roles.
