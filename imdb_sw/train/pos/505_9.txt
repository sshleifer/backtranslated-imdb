Very good start. I was surprised to find a machine not too high: It should be cruder, similar to what we saw in the previous series. The cast is interesting, although the woman of Vulkan comes as a very young man. He needs school on Spock who, after all, is an example of this race. They still could not choose Jeri Ryan. I love Mrs. Park, the Korean woman (?). The doctor is likely. You didn't look for other men except for a black man. He loves so much. Bakula needs to get his niche - In QL his point was his sense of humor and his desire to try anything. He is, of course, great and strong enough for the heroes. Heavies were the same, although I didn't like their decisions.
