An experienced Russian editor organizes the Stanislavsky system for winning the contract - which makes him and his beautiful wife GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. What could be just a silly soap-up to good quality production & best practice for a very comedy-friendly situation. A few unfortunate compounds are beaten to keep the attention of the viewer - the ways in which the code has been installed as faces on the card; the introduction of acrobat zany into the plot for any other reason than a little relaxation of humor; and the way that different types of Americans are shown to be made through listening to the final game. Paul Lukas & Loretta Young performs well as the Sweethearts Bridge - Lukas suave & sophisticated and Miss Young passionately love and beautiful (even if the script keeps boasting very little). They are happy to watch, even when their behavior is not reliable or compelling. Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a happy spirit writer who loves Miss Young. Glenda Farrell's love looks at her custom desire of the wisecracking in a small role as McHugh's tsy gal pal. Roscoe Karns leads a quick discussion of radio as a radio broadcaster. The decline of Ferdinand Gottschalk is amazing as a brobbishi bridge expert. Modern Children will recognize Dewey Robinson as a nightclub club; Emma Dunn as the author of the sister's sob; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian assistant; and Jimmy Conlin as a Kibitzer in the final game of the bridge - all were not accepted. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from the fad for the contract level that had entered the country since its 1920s.
