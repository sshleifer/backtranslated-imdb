Its about when Gunga Din is released on DVD. I can't say exactly how many times I have watched this beautiful film but, I've never burned it. The leading staff worked very well. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are a team that cannot fail. <br /> <br /> I can't get on their use in India. Your first view of Sergeants Three, is when you see them involved in fighting with other soldiers on the so-called Park Map. The three Sergeants are sent on a trip to find out what happened to the line of contacts entering the lost city or so they think. <br /> <br /> Participating in important repairs and soon finds a few "residents" in hiding. Once infected by the mad group and do not go back. It is later sent to another message that provides Sgt Cutter a chance to go to Gold and Din. They find the temple of gold and are bound by the evil Kali followers. Din is sent to get help with Cutter gets captured. Recently McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and they are also arrested. They are faced with death, they look without help if their car comes to save them. The wicked look and are about to attack their attack when wounded Blood climbs on the golden dome and claps his hands that warns the British to drive them out. To do this, Din was killed. The soldiers are attacking the evil and they have just defeated them. At the end, Din is honored if he is made a brilliant honor in the British Army.
