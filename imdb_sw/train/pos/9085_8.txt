I see so many bad publications and people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the US, at least, until mid-September. Perhaps this is a fun expats living in S. Korea who saw earlier. I'm an American and I saw today. I thought the special effects were better, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we are all used from many other films. It was not quite difficult to follow. Acting and guidance was weak, but some people were very good. There was a sense of humor, too. I scored 8 hours because I had a good time to look at it, that's what I went.
