A great version for anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie you don't see every day. It has the best actors to go with beautiful stories. This is not the usual responsibility for Bruce Willis but he has a role as he holds John McClane. <br /> <br /> Virus-kills everyone in the world and leaves a few stories of survivors not new but the story takes a new direction on it. Person (Bruce) returns back in time to get information about a virus that has deleted most of the type of person. <br /> <br /> The characters in this were amazing. I must tell Brad Pitt who was cautious as a mental patient James Cole (Bruce) meets in a psychiatric hospital. The director did an amazing job to bring us a horrible picture of future destruction and human-made virus. Animals seen on the viral world made them feel like they are running the world when humans are taken to underground equipment. <br /> <br /> This movie was very good and you must see and must also be yourself. I recommend it very much. <br /> <br /> 10/10
