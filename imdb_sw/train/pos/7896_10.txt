This is an EXCELLENT model of the original Bette Davis talent. Production is on the average of 1936. I can't understand why the rights holders of this film are not on DVD. Owners, PLEASE PLEASE open it. I could buy immediately. I haven't seen it for over thirty years, on television, but remember well.
