This film is a typical video of a TV series on the Indian radio station doordarshan at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" meaning the baluni. Each part was a new story. The story is good and the original is very good and "lobby" Abhay Doel is doing a good job but it is not worth the "normal" and "third-class" role (as he calls himself in the film). In fact Shayan Munshi and her hair refuses short and without designer clothes would have been fitted to the position of Abhays but Shayan have not only talent to remove it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to check the series if available. It's the same story except for running around with the mother of friends and the introduction of the beginning. Acting of television actors was much better than these "stars". The only reason for these movies is flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) stories up to 2+ hours. So it has to get draggy. Even the singing of the nose did not create. These movies are good for Sunday afternoon and are really comforting if you haven't seen the original serial TV. Script and the end of the serial was the best quality / <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############# ### ### SPOILERS HEAD ############## SPOILERS HEAD ######################## That end of the series The original was more powerful as a hero who dismisses a girl even thinks she is ready to marry. He knows and tells him that they do not want to “get paid” and he was not helped by that purpose. The director or script writes somehow could not complete the end of this film. At the end it would have been to buy tears for the eyes of the girls and would have boys playing in agreement. The delivery was not correct. But I feel this is a wonderful copy. No loan should be given to the director / author. The story is surprising and it is for one of the most famous authors of the novel class of PREMchand munshi. I don't know if this is an original munshi story but many short stories within its series include a few of the Indian journalists and many other Indian writers.
