Surprisingly he saw this on a plane for Singapore recently (I think I would like to miss it on Cinemalaya film). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 hundred per each) and 20 directors show love in different Paris pockets. One of my fave groups is 'Parc Monceau' and Alfonso Cuarn (Great Prospect, Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban), which were released by one ongoing lead with Nick Nolte's articles. The Coen brothers' brothers' Tuileries' star Steve Buscemi as a metro tourist was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe at 'Place des Victoires' were sad. For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / Quartier des Enfants Rouges' show that she has been expecting and breathing for a while when it was brilliant. Elijah Wood as a victim of a vampire in 'Quartier de la Madeleine' was pretty surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a good couple in the 'Pre-Lachaise' of Wes Craven. <Natalie Portman was as beautiful as a young French actress who had a demolition in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But in spite of many displays of love, the implementation of more mature and Gena Rowlands in the 'Quartier Latin' was similar-inducing. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is carried out and carefully thought of. There is also a number of memorable records. One especially is this from a deceiving husband who has finally left his grandmother to stay with his dead wife in his last days: "In pretending to be a man of love, he became a man of love."
