I liked this kind of film reminded my marriage. It is very clean you can see with the family. It has done very well. Songs are similar too. I think the author's author is good. Movie shows how marriage goes on time. Couples in different stages of life and relationships in their life film shows very well a small step in parallel in the same story. Some conversations are quite good. The movie shows a human feeling very complex not for more drama. Also the perfect shows are after all not so perfect. It shows very well the newly planned marriage trends. The movie is very well written and directed.
