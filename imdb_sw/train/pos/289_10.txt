I love all movies by Michael Landon Jr. And the cast of Michael Landon Jr's Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not be better. Dale Midkiff has ways to pull this character. <br /> <br /> This movie has set me spellbound from beginning to end. The death of a baby girl Missie & Willies and during the visit of the Clarks was only God's time. How they were involved with death and how Clark helped them to do so was that of the love of the father. Though there are 3 movies before this [Love Comes Softly, Likes a lasting commitment & Love of Long Journey], I feel you can see this film and understand it easily. However leave and want to see the previous 3 movies from the history of all the characters behind them. Michael Landon Jr. is the best director <br /> <br /> I expect many more movies from him in the future.
