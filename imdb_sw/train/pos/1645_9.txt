This west has been done in a different way than many others. The truth is important here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. How this is presented makes an interesting piece of Americana. I would like to see this on large screens rather than tape, but it's worth checking to see how life has returned in the real west. Style is the best. Established 9. Torn & Farrell best in this film.
