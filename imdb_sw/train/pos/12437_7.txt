As a long-standing fan of Peter O'Donnell, I watched this film on DVD without a good hope of happiness; in fact I expected to achieve the disgust for remote control within fifteen minutes. But instead I was very excited about this production, and I was very happy to know how producers and director succeeded in telling the story of gentle Modest. They could avoid the trap of making a bad version of the books that we all know, and instead of choosing to focus on just the right life-style mentioned in the novel. As for production standards (and I am not a student of movies!): yes, the film was done on the financial and temporary budget and perhaps it shows ... but it makes fun of the viewer? In this case I do not think. Instead we are introduced to one of the world's most talented heroes and given the desire for his power. <br /> <br /> About reigning: because we in an unknown place the only people who care about are gentle and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me they were completely honest. Alexandra Staden, described by others as wood, and very thin that the heroine of action, brought to the wind of gentleness and beauty; His tactics (when military art was needed) but most importantly is a person who is trustworthy who is the foundation of the Canon of Goodness. OK, so we all know this film was given to Miramax's claim for the simplicity of Blaise's behavior, was made quickly and cheaper, but ... for someone can not wait to see the next production in this series and producers these - as much as they take into account the basic values ​​and features of the original stories!
