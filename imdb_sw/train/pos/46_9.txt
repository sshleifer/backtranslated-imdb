At the end of this film, perhaps 7 or 8, it took one night before it was viewed in Blockbuster and liked it, I showed it to 4 people so far and enjoyed it too. Avoid the beauty of Hollywood, special effects and stress on the "cause of shock", this independent film by Paul F. Ryan blows the nail on the head in dealing with post-traumatic conditions. Take place after the high school shot, Alicia two (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) makes the impossible guarantee. Alicia, a stone-hearted girl, Goth who has a positive outlook on life helps Deanna overcome life and death issues and live in the future. Meanwhile Deanna tries to help Alicia see some gentle and light world again. Not insisting on an amazing shooting incident, but with a personal relationship between those who saved it off the film. With its time to open a low and short budget, this film is far from cheesy. Ryan respects the situation he has never endured and tried to strive in the human psyche. With a wonderful and coming actor, Philip, he adds a series of key to the discussion and the general feel of the film and Christensen helps to balance out "the penalty and darkness" to hear this movie may be. In general, I recommend this movie and if you like the topic of school violence and abuse and learn more about it, I also show the document "The World of Girls" released by CBC in 2004, which deals with the topic of social violence, comparing and comparing categories two girls in Montreal, Quebec and others in Victoria, British Columbia, a group of friends and friends of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who committed suicide after being abused.
