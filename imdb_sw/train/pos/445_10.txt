I first noticed Enchanted April five years ago. I loved him so much that my husband invited me to the next Christmas copy. It is about two women who decide to rent a fortress in Italy for April, leaving their lives behind them. Women are very sad at the beginning of the film, and you can't help but strengthen them as they plan to get away from two other women who invite them together to share costs. This is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen. It's clean and simple, without a car running, no violence and no deaths. It was done carefully and with very good taste. You can't help but smile everywhere - but you shed tears of joy!
