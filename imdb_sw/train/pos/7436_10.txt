This presentation of the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is the most beautiful interpretation of the Coleridge's haunting poem. An amazing movie, with a two-year collection of attempts to show the epic of 1798 with world-famous artists, and a beautiful commentary of Michael Redgrave, are very good at seeing this beautiful visual work. <br /> <br /> At the age of television, work like this is a very important tool to convince young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of good poems. For the best of my skills, this kind of work is really few; that's sad. As a world-class student and as a former professor of college and a professional consultant, I feel that the best epic poems like "Rime of the Old Mariner" should be "translated". Although not a movie critic, but as a heroic reader of classic literature, I am glad to recommend this beautiful production without any reservations.
