Faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck who has spent years in China as a child of Islamic parents who gave him a detailed definition of Chinese culture and his philosophy, the effectiveness of this film has been done with skill, both in technical and acting skills. Wang Lung is a humble farmer thanks to the foundation of life: living in his country and being a new marriage to Olan, a rich and powerful family member in the village area. Despite the best efforts of Wang Lung and Olan to farm the land, raise children, and create savings and wealth, hunger threatens to erase everything they have worked on. By choosing not to sell their land, traditional Asian beliefs, they instead go to the capital to wait outside the famine. During the city, it is reduced to praying and being just one of hundreds of unfortunate families. Although it is not a warrior, Olan gets into the hands of a crowd in a rich house. He has gone round for the implementation of the army, but he is saved in the last minute. His good luck, however, is that he found the valuable instruments on the loot site that gives him and his family the opportunity to return to their farm to resume. The newly acquired wealth replaces Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, independent and takes credit for getting. He becomes a rich farmer but that makes things worse if he becomes unappreciative, arrogant and hard to imagine. She loses touch and basic things in life that money cannot buy: loyalty, commitment, honesty, equality and honesty. For punishment, nature again returns the table on Wang Lung by sending a blow of locusts to destroy everything he has. He is kneeling, Wang Lung helps all friends, old friends, staff and family. With all help, he succeeds in the field store. As a result of this experience, sometimes it returns to humility and gratitude on the basis of life.
