Then I read that at least two members were sent through and I must say, I know maybe it will not be true for the vision of Lars von Trier, but I would like to look for the managers of the players instead of seeing the planned end! In fact, it would be difficult to find a person playing Helmer if the character is suitable. Helmer, the doctor you like to hate! I think I've never seen an independent, non-behavioral, self-righteous character on the screen! But, I could look at the changes in the executives .... I just need to know how it feels!
