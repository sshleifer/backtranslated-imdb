This movie got each of the ten votes I gave! Thank you people for making a film worth watching. You showed the world, you can still write, directly, generate and star in the black film without negative views. The ceremony was also amazing, hats off for poets and musicians. I looked at last night, if I loved my boyfriend again. I will add to my collection of movies today, and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, don't worry about the amount ....
