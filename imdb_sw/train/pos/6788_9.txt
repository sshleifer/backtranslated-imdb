Stories and characters were some of the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for PS and cutting scenes and overs sounds were wonderful. I played the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. I felt the problems that the protagonist met was reliable and true and I believe it deserves to be good. or at least remake. If you made it for ps3 I could only buy this game system and maybe its amazing surprise also the idea and the implementation of the dragoon system is enough to verify the lease and on these childbirth advertisements while sometimes cheating (buster stupid wand) anti-system The addition and plot makes this game buy open.
