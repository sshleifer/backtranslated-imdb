You know the story - the plucky no-hopers group comes into the competition that they seem to have no chance to win - it's a story that has been done by death by Hollywood (Bring It On, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best etc.). Now Korea gives you to go with the Taekwondo team facing glory? and guess what? The result is predictable but ultimately satisfactory. The fact that this film does not make flat on its face is less than those with talented age who are making you care for the characters, and this continues to look at the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your usual military movie may be disappointed? Taekwondo does not provide the usual step of action and acrobatics in many Kung Fu films; The point is limited to (although interesting) kicking and punch regularly. This does not matter, however, because it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle to do something of themselves that makes this movie succeed.
