As part of the release of Casino Royale, this film has a new star, from Roger Michell (Notting Hill) director. I almost put it away because it's a little boring, but I'm glad I lived with it. Mainly May (Anne Reid) is a mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who can't see anyone and had no boy in years. His daughter says she can marry her new marriage, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After knowing only a few days, May and Darren have a secret thing. And in his age, with something 30, and a new Bond? However, they really want to keep it secret, but May be sad and wonder if Helen will know. When he does, Darren gets less trouble than May. In fact, Helen asks for permission to beat her. Also star Peter Vaughan as Toots, Dana Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very nice!
