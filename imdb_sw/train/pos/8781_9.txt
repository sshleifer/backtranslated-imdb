I think I am a small boxing movie and as long as there is only one thing that prevents you from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie that has been made. This is Robert Skipper / Paul Newman flick "The Man Who Loves Me." That movie can be the number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is the number of almost 2. In the late 1800s the pipeline was moving away from the brutal days of non-protective laws during "gentlemanly" more than Marquis's Queensbury rules. And the game was away from the day when it was an illegal festival and a time of acceptance and respect. "Gentleman Jim" is not actually looking for those days. It's romanticized and, yes, even a little hokey sometimes. But it's always very fun. Errol Flynn is perfect as "Gentleman" Jim who is not really "gentleman" at all but is a quick speaker from a class of working class. Alexis Smith is totally ravishing as a high-class woman who has a relationship of love / hatred (and we all know it, of course, love that will win the final match) "Chief John L Sullivan (whose famous line was not" I can insult anyone in the world "of course ... romantic again) hands over his corridor to Corbett. That is one of the most important events in any sporting event ever. True? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want careful attention to "Bull Raging" instead. That's the most realistic movie boxing. But "gentle Jim" is more fun.
