One of the Funniest of John, Eugene Levy is great in this too, Just want the label would know that this needs to be a DVD, I have to be on video tape, but feel that this film deserves the DVD (and the extra will be great) Monitoring Kung Fu U ( Kung Fu U) skit is very funny, like the whole film, also the events it has with his girlfriend and his family is great, this movie has not been seen on TV, but it loses more than hilarity when it has been changed for TV advertising, if you can find a video I would recommend buying (ebay is a good place to get a copy) I will put my VHS up to one day when we see it on DVD. there are many movies out there that have not yet been removed from the DVD, and this is one of them.
