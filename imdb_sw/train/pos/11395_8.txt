I sang from my old music album and this is one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. Achieved Two Prizes of the Best College of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of the American painter in Paris who is trying to make it. Nina Foch is a modern woman of the way and she is very eager to help her, but soon she gets to love the boy. At the same time Gene Kelly falls for a beautiful girl, Leslie Caron. Her great actress, and I must say it is wonderful together on the apartment and otherwise. The famous French singer Georges Guietary sings, too. So if you like to play nice and soft and filled with the finest piano fingers of Oscar Levant, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
