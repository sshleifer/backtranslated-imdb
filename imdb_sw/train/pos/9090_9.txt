"Hollywood Hotel" is an exciting, exciting, interesting music from Warners who forgot to ignore it. It should be noted as only by providing the official song of Tinseltown's theme - "Hooray for Hollywood." The result of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has many statues of stars, however, including a delightful "I am like Fish out of Water," and "Strike in Moonlight." The best number of music is "Let That Be a Lesson For You," where Dick Powell and the company cite the misadventures of people who found themselves "behind the eighth ball," which finally looked at the rapidly punching Edgar Kennedy in the last number. The photo celebrates the beauty of Hollywood pictures and provides all the punctures at once, since it gets a lot of mileage from epileptic and maniacal artists and fraudulent studios. Release includes the best character players - Allyn Joslyn as a media agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell manager, Fritz Feld as an interesting restaurant restaurant, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as a keep-up The car manager, Mabel Todd as the sister of Goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her pastor even. The feature of the "racist" mentioned in the other assessment here is a second bit where Herbert looks at the black face during the "Gone With the Wind" series. It is in the wrong taste, but it should not stop you from seeing some of this film, especially Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I believe is the only one that can be found in this amazing jazz jazz. The "Dark Eyes" series goes very long and comes too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem, it fits your time and really a film that should be taken for the release of DVD.
