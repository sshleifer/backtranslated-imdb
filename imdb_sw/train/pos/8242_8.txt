I looked at FIDO at a movie center and I must say that I have been an instant fan. This movie looks like a comic book that takes care and feel in the 1950s, you know a good ten years when they played for Elvis when leaving the nuclear bombs in the desert for the event. People were very confident at the time that they are scared with the idea that those people who cut clean will naturally have the zombies like pets that work here. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this Canadian production, crisp and excellent movies, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and baby. <br /> <br /> It is a shame this film was not a great hit. It deserved more recognition. It's better than items from Tim Burton or SHAUN of the dead team. Oh well. It's a classic instant however.
