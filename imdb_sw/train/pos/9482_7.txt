Henri Verneuil represented commercial movies in France since 1960-1980. Always stuck in the box office, and usually says amazing and surprising stories of the casino, the war of the mafia and the battle with World War II, Verneuil can be counted to give us two hours of leisure Saturday night. He worked with the cream of male men of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... as Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It is an unusual odd film, which takes place mainly in office and conference rooms, one-on-one tracking location and any harder. <br /> <br /> Montand offers good performance, if it is dry, and is supported by other executives. I couldn't ask what Costa-Gavras could do with this story, on the basis of Z (the murder of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (the suffering of Artur London in Czechoslovakia and Stalinists).
