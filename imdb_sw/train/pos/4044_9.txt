I've got this film very well. The cluster is thoughtful, and if the viewer was pulled as a created being. The adoption process has been done very well for those who like to think - enough are kept hidden from the viewer early, and the questions continue to occur which respond later, generating well-thoughtable and very satisfying thinking, both of the brain and from the point of view. It seems that some people were looking for a flight run by this movie - one of those coming out of the gate. This would be similar to one of those pillars that first take you over the hill - to create a good sense of expectation - and finally, in my mind, the most completed on the foundation laid. <br /> <br /> The best movie.
