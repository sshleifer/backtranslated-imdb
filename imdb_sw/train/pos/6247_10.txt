The film's ads can show incidents of abusive or unusual sex, but these events are just rare pieces, it took to attract the audience. They are actually showing the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are always selected on their heads in their work and life, using force, which they may have elsewhere, for others. And the end of the harassment chain, especially women. <br /> <br /> Movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is certainly dealing with the face, but to endure it, it's even severe. The film is just like shortcuts, but it includes the style of documentation, with people like your neighbor, playing as they are. Without any stability, and more surprisingly, without any hope. His style of writing makes this movie more confused, because you know, these people are out there, and there are many of them, though our society focuses on the outside of the outside. The place where the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere seen that domestic abuse must be done, somewhere you expect to lose. I'm sure you know people like that. If you want to see movies without any interesting scenes (others may think that a woman with disabilities will return to ten supermarket is funny, but this happens in fact) and without spelling, check out this film. However it will be lost when you consider the headlines I fear, because the headlines cannot export.
