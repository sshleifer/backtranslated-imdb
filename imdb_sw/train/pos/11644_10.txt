This show is amazing! I've been a fan since he praised, and just watched me look ... I've seen bad things here, which I would not have, But, it shows you how abuse affects all involved, not just addict. You can see all kinds of addiction, from drugs and alcohol to shopping, or the punishment for eating. And in fact, it's sad to see some of the most popular faces that have also come. We have seen completed musicians, NBA player, and even young people, who need help. And since they have begun to show a few tracks, it has been amazing too. Now, you can see how long it is after their ep. If you didn't watch this out, please do. It's on A & E, and it's amazing! New eps are Sunday night at EST 10PM, if I remember correctly ... so keep your TiVo!
