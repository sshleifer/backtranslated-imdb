Anna Christie (1931) His / her words, this version of Anna Christie's Garbo, shot a year later in Germany and cast a month, is just beaten and refined enough to work better than English The version (both is the production of MGM American). Garbo is like anything that commands (or better as the presence of the screen) and its acting is more restricted. And he seems to be more easily accessible, perhaps for many reasons, but we can assume that he did not make his first photo chat, so it was quickly changed. It is not just a comparison of one film, this Anna Christie is still O'Neill who played with so many words. The theme of a woman who wants love without losing her independence here, but comes as quite unusual. There are some cases that are missing - part of Coney Island is shortened and not good - but in general it is a direct echo of the first film. Director, Jacques Feyder (Belgium-French), repeats only what was done already, which I think should be wrong. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both films for succession because they are well fitted the same way (not just a set, but shots, it's the same). There is a regular part given from the original film - some storms, with understanding, but also a short area where Marie Dressler (from English language) walks with her friend on board on the canal, drunk as possible. But it's just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see German actors take their part. There is no place to dressler, indeed, but for me the German father is more faithful and faithful in his performance. <br /> <br /> Anime theme - migration, fictional father, daughter turns to prostitution, and trouble finding real love - having strong currents back, especially with European fiber (Garbo, precisely, has a woman Swedish boy).
