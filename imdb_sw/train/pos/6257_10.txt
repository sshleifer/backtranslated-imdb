This document with Marian Cooper is quite amazing. I saw tonight at the Turner Classic Movie Center. I think I will see if I can import a copy to the DVD. The film file is not available everything wrong with chappy as you can think from the 1925 B & W silent film. To put Iran in 1925, the people of the refugee tribe in the document come from their home and cross the rough river, men, women, children, animals ... Then up and above the mountain of snow pass all barefoot. It sink or swim with climbing or dying. In search of grass for their animals. They have cattle, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one place a man carrying a mule with a very sick plant climbing mountain. Children in all documents seem happy and healthy. They had a very difficult life. I wonder if the Iranian ethnic groups still live like this. It cares for modern life in the United States.
