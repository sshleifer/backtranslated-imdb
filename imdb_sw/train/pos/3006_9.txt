While 9 may be seen as an odd mark for such a film, however, compared to hundreds and hundreds of tracking films from 1930 and 40 years, this is among the best and also very well comparing with the " later "Powell Movies" of man ". Now this does not mean that the film is similar to celebrity movies, like KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy but more than a traditional secret-detective film. Now you would have thought that there was no Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional romantic comic (something that is available in all films of a series of investigations) as well as fun would have a negative effect, but I did not miss it because this was a unique written film - having a case really interesting with good performances of all. <br /> <br /> The film begins on the dog's show and is called the KENNEL Criminal Case, although this Philo Vance film uses a little bit of time in a dog show and dog is not an important part of the film. Instead, a very hateful person is killed and left in a completely sealed room - a constant idea in other films (such as CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE). However, all of these are described to be very reliable and well suited well - putting my interests everywhere. I am sure you want some films of the day that had been recorded in mind with a unique work like this. This is definitely a protector.
