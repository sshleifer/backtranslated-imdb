I liked this section. It's very good that all 5 are participating in leaving LutherCorp and saving the world. I also love this section because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are the star stars in it !!! I hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we will follow this group of heroes around the world! =) It was very exciting and impressive viewers because of what will happen next. I think Chloe also joins the team as The Watchtower, which may be very unpleasant to do with him instead of Daily Planet because they don't have high authority. Also, I want to know what kind of subjects that Lex will use 33.1, I wonder what kind of authority some people in the world have !!!
