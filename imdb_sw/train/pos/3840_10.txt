Jerome Crabbe has the first role in this film. I saw this film 6 times and I'm still tired. This movie is similar to Meat + Blood somehow. Gerald Soetman is a good writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the biggest directors. I have seen all his movies except Showgirls. My mother does not like him very much but I disagree. I think all of his films are a journey to look at the general Memorandum and Primary session. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his movies including Total Note, Primary and Mjanja Foundation. I wish Jerry Goldsmith did not die. Dutch films are different but still enjoy.
