Victor McLaglen, the character of John Ford's INFORMER, reminded me of a circus from Fellini's La STRADA. Anthony Quinn played a cruel person, who may even be affected by pug-faced, Oscar-winning performance given by McLaglen.

Just look at how the media covered in this year's Oscars, contributing to Elia Kazan's scandal.
