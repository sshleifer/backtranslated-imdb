I will deal with the issues of the film here: It was a very engaging story about the reputation of destruction on all the desires used; A young Italian woman who cannot be reunited with her political partner who has been imprisoned (because of her apolitical view and independent way of life) finds comfort and passion for a young partner who is engaged in sexual relationships. Concerns, anger, compassion and desires that surround the story of the story are similar to the stability of stability that seems to interfere with the two guidelines. It filters a state of separation that is faced with all political strife that has been lost to the viewer (unless it has extensive knowledge of Italian politics during the 80's). I have seen the film insisting ... what was damaged is the free part of oral sex which the actor does on the male lead ... is not the same as the little leaves for thought. There are other sexual incidents in the film, which I feel important because they describe the spirit and loneliness that the characters live. But the oral sex area, I see, reduces the purpose of the real story. It was soft to date and once the sex scene was seen (which caused the hoopla again in his day), is like hitting the road. It is not a newsletter and I am a camp that believes that the film will not have any side effects if the area has been removed. And sadly, this area can prevent people from watching this fascinating film, which I believe is worth looking at because there is so much happening under the face, the more emotions and violence that have been learned in the lesson. Overall: A fantastic film has been hit by a sex scene that is not needed.
