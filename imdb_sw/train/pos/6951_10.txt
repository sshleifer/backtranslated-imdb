I wasn't a big fan of the television until I looked 24 for the first time. I came in late at the end of the delay. The 5th season ended before I saw my first place. It was part of the Series 3 which was on my parents DVR (digital video record) box when I was a house sitting for a weekend. It took that one part to me to be a line and enter the world of Jack Bauer. And the boy was walking! I looked for the next six seasons without talking. The next day I went to Blockbuster and I registered for a month at least twenty dollars and without saying it has been the biggest money I have had. I watched the first three season in three weeks. That's 72 events forty minutes !!! I will say that knowing what happens next is easier than DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine expecting to look for the 6th week of the week! I see it gently and ruthlessly but I'm going to try and look at it like all America! DVR installed and you can call the bet will be hard for a bit!
