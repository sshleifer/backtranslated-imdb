Mirage (1990) is a very horror / chiller from the 1990s, released in England on the "New World Video" studio. <br /> <br /> It is a horror movie of the desert about a small group of young friends who are involved in the weekend, just killed directly by an unknown power that gives a black truck truck !!! This film has other exciting events, and some run here and there, but we must say that acting was a cripple, even with low budget levels! But the film was unusual and I liked it, and I have never slept or wiped, which is always a good sign! I was almost given this film 6/10, but when I saw it was built on steam along the way, it had a good time of year and insisting, it had a good weakness, and the fact that the blonde in the female role was hottie too! will give you 7/10.
