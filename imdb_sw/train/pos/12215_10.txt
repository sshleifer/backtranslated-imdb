I loved this movie from the opening to the end. I have seen the style of direct director / actor talking to the participants / listeners very involved. <br /> <br /> I got the most exciting and enjoyable about this film was ignoring - and thus challenging - the gender and class. Idiosyncrasies of characters are portrayed as a power, and a lack of judgment - and acceptance of the characters themselves and everyone - enables me to embrace and allow themselves to enter their world. Without preaching, and with the mind and love of love and love, this movie has the ability to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world where people see and embrace as special and precious people. I expect more donations from a creative and talented director.
