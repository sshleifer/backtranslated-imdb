My father grew up seeing George Reeves in Superman and when I was a little child with VHS events and let me see them including this film (go down in the family if you would like), and I liked it. <Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with a mine of oil and from a mine happens a radioactive mass and targeted by the city you think to be dead and is on Superman to stop this violence. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and interesting to see. The special effects of the style and sound - the staff drew the same beauty and technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little child, and I'm 16 now, it just comes to show how they don't exist with the usual treasures of these adventures.
