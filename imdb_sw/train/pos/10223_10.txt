* other fighters <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to find a strong argument (acting, dated conversation, open story) unknown. Belafonte is as good as Brandoesque, confusing, the spirit of swearing who should be paid its wings but it is the wrong material from its old life to do so. He learns at the end of how his life is lost, physical life without love. Mostel is also as good as a sad man and his wife of Fanny. Despite his prayer for a miracle, his pain stops him from accepting (or believing) in one. Two social partners represent the alternative and help others, the results have been sad and sad. <br /> <br /> The amazing end is really the same as all the film. After watching anywhere in Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see the feather falling, and he comes to open as he finally agrees to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle (or to restore the health of Fanny or the Mostel faith), so he had no wings. Marriage grows against the knowledge of Mostel, the example of all men living: it's too late and you have no second chance. As "It's a wonderful life," this film is magical, wonderful, amazing, but sad.
