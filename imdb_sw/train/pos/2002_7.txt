To some extent, I loved this film better than previous VAMPIRES. I found that the movie can not be bad. As a woman with a fan of fear, I have been in fact that women at risk are the same staple. But they just beat Sheryl Lee very close. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a perfect character, and the worst person is gal! Arly Jover (who played the kitchen vacuum in BLADE) is anotherworldworld and death. Jon Bon Jovi ... ok, yes, no good actor, but makes OK. At least he does not start singing. Get on the cable if you can. It is up to Many Steps this month.
