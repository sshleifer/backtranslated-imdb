I like pictures that try something different. Many movies seem to be reversed by old ideas, so that's the main reason I recommend Passport for Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The movie is installed only after WW2 and the post-war shortages and testing the ball running London "barmy". The movie clips in a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They, too, are ill-able to buy what they want but they can't see any way to disappear. That is until they came out of the treasury on the treasure hidden by the contract which was called this neighborhood as a free nation a hundred years ago! For this document, they think, they can vote by voting and coupons and live life as they want, as it seems to be not British subjects! Which movie goes from there and how the crisis finally resolved is something you need to see for yourself. Stop the brilliant ideas of Ealing Studios come with this gem!
