Those who do not know and change Cassandra Peterson's Elvira, then this is a good place to start. "Elvira, Mrs Giza" begins with our heroine and boobs to resist the influence of the message. It seems that the aunt's mother has died and that she needs to be present for love reading. He is busy collecting money for the show he wants to open Las Vegas, decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of votes. Unfortunately, the place to go is the city of Fallwell, Massachusetts. After staying spell from his car to break down, he finds that his aunt has left 3 things: house, dog and cooking book. City dwellers have mixed mixtures: young people like him, women hate him, and people who look for him (though they are trying to remain the pillars of society). His worst problem is that his uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants his book of cooking. It seems that the book of cooking is a book of stories that will make him more powerful than war. <br /> <br /> The film is really fantastic, and Peterson aka Elvira use his "gifts" and sex as joke ("And don't forget, tomorrow we show you the head for two things ... I mean something with two heads"). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, a woman who works hard to keep the city in line, but end up looking ridiculous (picnic area is a perfect example). He deserves peek (film, not his boobs, of course).
