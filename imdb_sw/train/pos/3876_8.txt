Denmark's best practices, Sonja Richter stole this film from the bottom of everyone's noses, no one considering the great exhibits around him. Richter plays Anna, out of work, an independent, somewhat ignorant woman (and perhaps suicidal) who puts a desperate job with a wheelchair, mentioned, a year-old named Walentin (Danish actress) Frits Helmuth, who died in 77 shortly after this film was made). <br /> AL / SPOILER ALERT <br>> <br /> Valentin refuses to respond to anyone - until she is fighting a gifted Anna, whose bad way and a bad way brings the devil who was beaten to death by a death sentence personal. The author / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a powerful film on the trouble of a good businessman (Jorgen, played with Clausen) who loved a father who has never accepted him. The words of the film to the end, but Clausen has important things to say about euthanasia, nature and value of love and caring, and how one person, an unresponsive Anna, can change a person's life. It is highly recommended. The performance of Sonja Richter is alone worth the entry price.
