I'm not a fan of Steve Carell however I would like this movie about Dan, a consultant, who goes to his parents' house to stay with his children and end up with love with his brother's brother. His story has been told before, but not like this. There are very few bits that make the film better than the best. Release is amazing, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, she is very good as a widow who thinks to know everything but sees that knowing is different from feeling and that sometimes life is wondering you. Sometimes it is slow and wise in a way that the Hallmark smell card may be, the film is still how it can grow on you and become something more than running for a film film. Value check
