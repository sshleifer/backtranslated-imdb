See it as often as I could before leaving the area. An exciting and entertaining movie with some of my favorite stars. You just want me to get it again! What? Certainly buy / watch if I could. Please, someone else, bring us back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his leading women, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming. It was music, but also romantic, funny, and clever. This was my movie proposed by June Haver, though I always loved her. His impressive smile shone on the screen, and its beauty and talent were the property for any film. The lost help for their personal roles. A balanced and lighter film; just want us to get more like that!
