As I read other comments, I decided to watch this film ... First, it has used Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; enough ... <br /> <br /> Movies, intelligence and very interesting because, has been sent by an international European actor and composer such as from Turkey and Russia ... Second, Story is basic and you can think of if The best action to play would like in my opinion ... Third, the last frame is not unique or interesting, it is typical like other practical movies. ... Finally, I recommend watching this film ... And I hope You love to enjoy: D
