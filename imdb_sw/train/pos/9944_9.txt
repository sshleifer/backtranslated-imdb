Indeed, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems the special films of "feast" these days are amazingly amazing or high-budget / hyped in some way. <br /> <br /> Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to strengthen their hearts tae kwon do. Regardless of what you expect from this film, you are guaranteed to feel the relocation of the work, pain, and expectations that the perpetrators work for themselves. Although they are often happy, often the characters are well-fed: there is an old guard style who takes things very seriously, hoodlum turned a good man who just wants a second chance in life, a good team player who will die if he won only one in his life, and many other characters with their own problems - but most importantly, their own hopes and dreams. While the plot and goals of the movie are simple, these movie shows only the development of the characters as they win their personal and personal battles. In short, this film will leave you to be clean, you have decided, and satisfied.
