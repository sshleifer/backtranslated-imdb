Film Entertainment and Basic, Non-Stop has offered a comparison of eligibility to "Run Lola Run". The film grows rapidly in the follow-up sequence, while viewers learn about the three main characters through stimulating and routine days. The expulsion is not as a high speed, but as a journey that makes many films. During the "run" we see the characters grow and temporarily forget about their dreary life, about the "eyes" roles that they have bought, and finally forget about why they started running. Periods like fighting give the "definition" of the characters in the "Fight Club," runs the characters of this film and ways to overcome the false values ​​that we all allow society to build. Their race serves as a wonderful way of life from an unconscious perspective, and all three find the level of interpretation and fun in the process. Thank you and my pleasure just a little locked at the end of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to retain the false work of the eyes that I thought were running away from their journey. Still, the only real problem with this film is that it was not released out of Japan earlier.
