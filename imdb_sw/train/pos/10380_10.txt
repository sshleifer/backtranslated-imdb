in 1976 I was moving to us from ceylon. I was 23 years old, and I had been married for a little more than three years, and I had come out as a rabbi. I saw this movie on the old black and white TV, with a terrible reception, alone, and without interference, in the wake of which it seemed like an echo of the story. I was in a small house in a tucson arizona, and it was during the summer ... like everyone else here, I never forgot the pictures of this story called, and its remains of magic, and I have hoped that I would see again one day. I will continue to consider. I also want that someone will make a film of shirley verel 'other side of venus'. also has some similar effectiveness to the ongoing solution ...
