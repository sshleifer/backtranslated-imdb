Dial! I would like to tell anyone even if you like Metallica to see 'some kind of monster' is a kind of backbone on one of the world's biggest bandes that act like minded children during a breakage. It's fun and interesting. With the same lines it comes to dig! Movies about 'Dandy' Warhol 'and' Brian Jonestown 'killing two portland portland which begins the music genres in the home town only for one of the biggest bands and one fall through the music history books. From the beginning the two bands come in the opposite direction on their ability to make decisions as good or bad. Strikes over seven years and sometimes painful to watch we see an increase in meteoric of dandy for popularity (thanks to ad adapaphone ad!) And Jonestown seminal fall from the environment of instigators beat wannabes. Since the band is becoming more popular, friendships are described as strong tensions and with a number of points they have to move and even to action. All this is half a minute of funny and half and believe it or not is carefully watching potential. As I said earlier you can watch the Metallica film even if you don't mind band. Dial! on the other hand is a little different and it's more enjoyable and very easy to check if you have interest in passing in any band. It is still a good film and more than a covenant that is not in the band than to encourage that as a way of working. Dial! Is a mad journey on rock tails and rock and a good example of the pit and the pleasure of being or wanting to be popular.
