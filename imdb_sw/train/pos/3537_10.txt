James's bail game is the best match of the bond I made in my life is my Jacob's game so far because: <br /> <br /> The message in this game is very fun can be very hard that makes it The most fun of playing missions has a lot of weapons you use is very good. Cars in this game are fantastic car messages you have many steps and it is very fun to play. Sounds over actors are very good and it's cool that Sean Connery makes a voice to James's flag also the way the button looks very cool because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James's bond on movies and another character looks very similar to looking at the film . Beautiful pictures in this game of James's collateral. Also the game follows a very good film but not all but a lot of time that you do is cool. <br /> <br /> Total score ********** out of ***** *****
