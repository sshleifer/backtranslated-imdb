My children just came to stand on this film the other night and if things started playing play really interested in me. I had to go out to bowling league so that I could record them on dvr so that I could watch others later. Yes, I have looked at you and before my shirt must be inserted after the buckets of cry. It was the best movie even though I was almost feeling the pain and pain these girls were experiencing. And I never in a million years would think why Alissia had gone from this beautiful girl with goth anti-social. That's probably why my shirt was dropped because I've had the same pain that Alissia had. I also did not want to find this film, but I'm sure I have seen it. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love a good drama or player.
