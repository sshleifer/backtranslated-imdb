Wow, IMDb's reputation with Google, since I've been trying to remember the name of this amazing fing film for over 15 years now. Slaughter Top, man! Hells yeah! I will not give you a summary of the plot, and the executives, and the order, because you all know what. That's why you're here. What I will do, however, is to describe the memory of my collective memory of this 80-D-Movie button with slasher. In 1987, when I was 7 years old, my father used all these terrible movies. Would he care that his children were watching them? No. So, the little time I saw the Great. What I saw in the movie is a lot of time. I haven't seen it since, but I remember until this day most of the ignorance kills the movie. For example, sex after sex (why is there a metal bed in school?) Finds electricity. Or, the boy is lying in a cess dam. Come! My personal love, though ... belly to pull from the beer. Amazing! Can you honestly trust in a movie where one of the characters finds beer in a school that is abandoned, like, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink? Then her stomach cracked? What !? And a great line: Let's take my car ... always starts. Classic climbs all the way. I mean, I look back now, nearly 20 years later, and laugh. But when I was 7 years old, I was afraid sh! Does the jester hat (or was a mask?) Which the killer takes everywhere he f * ck! <br /> <br /> For all, yes, movie crappy. But for the purpose of the theory and because of this movie gets 9 out of 10 from me. Do not stay up late every late real night and hope to catch this for future future future Movie, or copy VHS copies and dust from your VCR.
