"Top Top" is a totally ignoring totally on Marty's high school, who gets to take all the time with certain pranksters. Prank goes badly and he ends up getting savagely burned.Five years later all his torturers attend ten-one of them, of course, and Marty down and see them kill one after another. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") causes the cast as a heroine (dying!). Acting is very serious, there is no doubt at all. Positive deaths to meet female ferrous females: a female pregnancy breaks down, another female female gets a bath, a text, a bed with a ticket, a girl is stuck, and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye. The killer wearing a mask of honor and common and paste (good old English castle) is very good. However, the finale of the dream is quite pathetic. All in all it is true that "Killing Up" is a piece of garbage, but I enjoyed it Only for fans of very bad flicks.
