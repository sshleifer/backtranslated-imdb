I was watching this show when I was a little girl. Although I don't remember much about it, I must say that it was a good show. Also, I don't think I've seen every section. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I agree to remember the theme of the theme. Everyone was made well, the design of the clothes was good. Exhibitions were high, too. I hope that some network brings this series back one day so I can see each section. Before I close this, I would say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I don't think I've seen every section. Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is restored again on the air, I hope that you will keep it one day before going off the air for good.
