Just concentrate on something that has lost weight; well, you can lose weight you don't know. However, what can I say, I love this film. It has the meaning of the young and guilty found in the film as Stand By Me and Goonies. Jake's clothing shows the beauty of simple things and how often we look at them. This film reminds us of what to see the world through the eyes of children and magic, mystery, and fear they see. Jake's Closet presents the only human story with his mercy that anyone with childhood can relate to the fall of love. Watch with friends; look with loved ones; create opportunities for optional wine.
