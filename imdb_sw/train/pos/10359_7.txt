Meryl Streep is a professional. Well, at least as an actor. I know he has been honored to do many tasks for accents, but he nails every time. His work as Lindy Chamberlain was a spark. Mrs. Chamberlain, as shown here, was not very interesting, not all intelligent. But that only makes Streep the most wonderful work. I think he has a 10 or more value of his Oscar selection. About the film, well, there were several interesting things. I don't know a lot about Australia, but the topic of religious conflict between the general public has played a major role in the story. I had lost this when I saw the film first several years ago, but it happened with a loud and clear voice yesterday. And it seems that Australian journalists are as well as the completion of the trouble-inducing to implement and overkill as American counterparts. Very good film. There are very different. Grade: B
