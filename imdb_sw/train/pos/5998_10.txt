Treatment is an amazing film ... So it's celebrated and so right REAL! I was fortunate to catch 'Medical' investigations in NYC season and hit me completely! I also heard winning awards from the festival, and it is definitely worth it. The first thing that hit me was the movie. Eric Giovon did a wonderful job. The shooting of the half-love scene in the film was amazing. The area of ​​love was important in this film, and Jafri got the point but also placed an interesting area. Giovon and Jafri make a good creative team and should work together in future projects. Judy Maier's story was so surreal but at the same time exciting heart, it made me feel what the main character felt. I am a very critical critic but I must say Therapy is one of my favorite movies. JUST LOVE IT! If you haven't seen yet, look!
