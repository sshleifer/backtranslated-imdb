I am a fan of kung fu, but not a fan of Woo. I am not interested in gangster films filled with over-top-guns-playing. Now, military art; * that * good! And John Woo was surprised here to produce a movie of the kung fu, which has almost has a lot of fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is good things. Many events of fighting are very good (and some do not like), and the main characters are interested and love. The wicked are very evil, but they have no entertainment at all. You have gotta see the sleeping witch! He can fight only when he is asleep - it's hysterical! Once you have a regular look, however, the end of Fighting Chivalry may get a bit slow and long, and especially because most of the combat events are actually not good. So, I measure "only" 7 out of 10. But it's almost "8". <br /> <br /> All in one of the best kung fu movies, made a smack-dab into the core heart of kung fu cinema. All the best movies of kung fu start in the middle of the 1970s, with different distances from '70ies and early' 70ies (and early '80ies, being right).
