Enchanting, romantic, creative, and funny. The vision of this amazing film is almost non-comparable, more than "death talks" as Spirit. When we know intuitively that Peter and June will have the ultimate happiness at the end of that long long level, happiness is on the journey. The story of the story, of course, is not enough: love overcomes all. But efforts to achieve this victory are played in the heavenly realm of emerging vision and the magnitude of growth. For more than 500 best practices that reflect the age and culture, the vision of the directors of heaven still do not remember six decades later, apart from CGI. However, at all cosmic levels, Powell and Pressburger knew the most important facts: good news is told to a smaller level. An amazing feature, the romantic "Stairway" romance is taken to the last humility: June teardrop, stored on the rose ring. <br /> <br /> This film, like the story and set itself, is one for years.
