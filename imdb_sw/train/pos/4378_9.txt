This is a moving story of the legendary story of Scotland, Rob Roy, and his war with feudal land owners. As Braveheart which is often compared, not history. Despite their false nature, I measure all these movies and it is difficult to choose between these two. 13th century William Wallace is, as some have said, a greater example than national life, during the 18th century Rob Roy comes as a respected but ordinary Scotsman. This story revolves around the family leader, Robert Roy McGregor, who lives on Scotland's ice island with his wife Mary and their two small children. If the movie starts, he and his brothers hunt hunting thieves who stole the master's master. Rob Roy then wants to improve the living conditions of his people so he plans to borrow £ 1,000 from Scotland, Marquis of Montrose, to buy cattle for cattle to the market. He gives his friend a short time, Alan McDonald. When McDonald and all the money die, Rob Roy is involved with Montrose with his defensive advocate, Archibald Cunningham, and his reason for scandal, Killearn. Rob Roy's honor is also tested when Montrose wants to involve him in a false witness against his opponent, Duke Argyle, who wants to accuse him of being Jacobite. Liam Leeson's pride is a brilliant like Rob Roy, intelligent, powerful, and a good hero and someone whose feelings of respect are important to this story. Personally, I feel that this is the best practice of Neeson, its discussion (although Irish) adds legality to the average viewer. Rob Roy is a stubborn, arrogant, bold, and faithful person whose word can be trusted. He is a loving husband and father, and is also trusted by his friend, McDonald, who is sentenced to take him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> skillfully shows his great enemy and indeed one of the most skeptical and worried attackers, Archibald Cunningham, peacock uninformed, absent. He is most affected by someone who makes his main business to attract local women, whether or not. Cunningham's own sympathy always tells the fact that he is a bastard does not know the identity of his father, though this is unacceptable to his evil crimes, rape and theft. Also, he angrily dismissed the little girl, Betty, after being pregnant with her child, causing her suicide. John Hurt shows a proud and arrogant Montrose, who is later described as Cunningham's father. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially the story of a trustworthy love between a natural person and his wife, for beautifully illustrating the relationship of love between Rob Roy and Mary. Those who question the presence of a desire in marriage should look for husband and wife! I think the words used by this pair, 'It's very good to me…' is certainly one of the most beautiful words of love in all movies. The most compelling function is Jessica Lange as Rob's wife, Mary McGregor. Without it, he has a beautiful but natural look of a strong wife and a strong wife. Leaves bring courage and respect to his role when he is raped by a despised Cunningham, while Killearn's disgusting appearance appears. His discussion is being discussed but full of pride and grace. I give Hollywood because once they only showed enough in the rape area to reveal her violence and Maria's pain and humiliation, but nothing was planned to feel. Their brother, Alastair McGregor, expresses emotional pain as he learns about Mary's rape, and is tortured when swearing in secret to tell her husband her violation with Cunningham. Of course this film has a beautiful scenic landscape of the Scottish forest, as well as the most beautiful period of dress and the right music. There are no major war events like in Braveheart, but the ongoing action of engaging with the sword of a sword especially in the last duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham. This is an interesting movie that has both stages and beautiful love stories.
