I just watched the "Water Water Water" document on the cable of the Starz cable cable. Of course, one of my most enjoyable experiences ever! Writes artists in the San Francisco Bay area with creative talents involved with some of the best films made. In addition to the famous artists mentioned, t also includes groups with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and part of Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on the DVD-this is necessary for any collection of movie history and brilliant films. If you are too far from the movies and people who create them, you will not be discouraged.
