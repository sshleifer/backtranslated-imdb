The basis of this series of anime is on the bread, of all items to set up a plot! I really laughed. The main character has a special bread that has been born, and it goes to the bread of the school. I would like to be available on the DVD, and it doesn't matter if it has a title or is mentioned - it's good. Even the theme of the only theme is funny. At one time in the theme of the theme, there is an African-Japanese man with an afro on a horse, with a French baguette like a samurai sword. These images will be meaningless unless you see the anime. You will laugh until your sides hurt. It's quite a unique anime that I have seen so far.
