Kurt Russell is very good as a man who lives away from his former glory, Reno Power. Robin Williams is the opposite of polar in low performance as Jack Dundee. He left the Great Passover more than one. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most popular events performed on one film, such as Jack says on the mouse, Reno is possible, and caribou calls come out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic which does not show soccer in the mud how it should be played (note for NFL).
