Talk about the cast of dreams - just two of the wonderful actors who have ever seen anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Millions of Fire," a funny comedy, quirky also star Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an old player who finds a new computer program (Morley) and has a chance to run with Malden - with the goal of breaking in mind. Not a soft ship; he was attracted by his competitor in the company, played with Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows her place under another name), becomes her secretary for a short time. He can not work and looks at all the films in different jobs - all ended with him being expelled. When Newhart comes to her, she asks Ustinov on her flat to curry as a lid-up, but soon they decide that they have been done for each other. Of course, he does not know Ustinov is a hippo. This is a very good movie - you can't help but you love Ustinov and Smith and be interested in Ustinov's destruction, his skills, and ways that lose trouble. But there is a moving finish that will show you who has really mind. Do not miss this film, installed on '60s London. It's important if it's just hearing Maggie Smith, "I've been sacked."
