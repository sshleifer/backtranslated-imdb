I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was released first and maybe eight times over the years of T.V or video. It was always one of my films that love very much and / or Charlton Heston film. <br /> <br /> Recently, Egypt's memorial at L.A. it had twelve films Charlton Heston. I left the country to see six films for a two-day period. Green Green looks great on Egypt's great screen and perfect print. From its opening meeting to the home location to the end of the film was amazing. Charlton Heston as a soldier who lives in dogs eat dog dogs and a few natural resources left behind and there is no understanding of how the world had Eddie Robinson as a person who remembers the past things is good. <br /> <br /> Their Chemistry together is amazing. This film also looks very well in published for 35mm big. Fleisher knows how to fill out the screens, and movie movies, text, music is used, and everything is about. The film is also very powerful in its bright and most likely future prospects. Imagine how the world population grew, the rainforest that was lost, the resources used, the impact of the green house increased since 1973. I wonder why this film has never played in movies all these years. His reputation should be better. Speaking of qualities, people often speak like Charlton Heston is not a good actor. See him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, Warlord, Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee go back I am sure he is one of our best executives. Of course he did about other twelve movies and for those who care about you know what it is. <br /> <br />
