As if the film was not worth it, this is the best way to get a full description of the novel as an appendix. In the summer of 1968 I saw a film in NYC; fall to school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the joy of reading the novel was my deep-looking film. And better or worse - and now I have read and taught novel for more than three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
