"Cinéma is dead, live long movies!" He said Peter Greenaway, one of the modern innovative and productive directors, at an annual film film Anonimul, which received the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year's awards course went to "Failure" for Jafar Panahi. I had to see this evening in Bucharest in a modern festival match. Cinéma is dead but still very happy. The Panahi film says by way of how the Iranian society is shown. Printed by phone, "Obstacle" is a story headed by a real life experience held by Panahi's daughter: trouble and danger were taken when deciding to attend a football match. This is banned in Iran as we are informed. What Panahi can do is give in a small way, but for, perhaps, a lot of work, intelligence and humorous cultural orientation in the society that puts women to a different level. The deficit of the law is good. The film has a happy ending, after all because the Iranian team goes to the World Cup. I really liked the idea, the idea of ​​this film. I would like to see some of Panahi's films that have been banned in Iran as well. I think that he can think of as a director of activists.
