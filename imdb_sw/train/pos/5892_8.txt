Thomas Ince was always a knack to bring a simple story home to life with full and flair. "Italy" is the film. Acting firm, especially by George Beban, the father of silent child George Beban, Jr., and the wonderful sets indicate the real impression of the original migrant tenements in New York. This gives the 1915 film the fact that is common in this aspect of this harvest. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with modern days with someone (George Beban in modern clothes) reading stories about Italian migrants, and then we transition into the story with George play migrator. He raises enough money to bring his wife from Italy to the United States, marry him, and has a son with him. But times are hard and family struggles to live. I found myself wondering why the mother did not breastfeed her baby, and avoiding problems with dirty formula, but oh well, even the early Dream Factory was pushing the proper political behavior for women in 1915! <br /> The best place in the picture is when Beban has a chance to take revenge on a criminal boss who did not give him a prison without a commitment, and for the last minute he decides on his action plan. Very neat. I loved the effect of the curtain, it was good. Incredible use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give "Italy" 8 out of 10.
