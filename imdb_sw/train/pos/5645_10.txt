I bought a DVD to give a proposal from Amazon.com according to my other interests. They tie nail on the head with this. I remember watching the show when it was on the TV but always wondered what happened. Ten years later, it's like looking again for the first time. Lucas Black as the Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck is good together, although they are some opponents. Welcome to represent good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I have never really understood what Lucas had to be, but then it is right to say, he has a special authority that I don't believe was given to anything sacred. He can make ringing rings, writing appearances, or even causing someone to change. Nothing, there are few cases where he becomes a good person despite all. For all, this is a good series who like many others I can think of, (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man, and SeaQuest DSV for just a few names) were canceled the way before their time. King Steven's (US Sunday Network) appears to be the only thing in this seemingly visible form. Nothing worth looking at the TV again. This is because anything related to Christianity and Satan is considered wrong and should be given immediately from the TV. So, at the same time, I will continue to buy DVD sets and watchdogs that should still be on television but have been removed from the TV and religious zealots so that we can check "quality" shows as Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (what group of which skin is).
