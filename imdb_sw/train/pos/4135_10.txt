This is a very interesting film, one of my romantic comedies. It is very exciting and cast is amazing. Although Laurence Olivier is associated with Shakespearean's work which is shown in this film that does not mean playing just the most common performances. He can change from a sexual divorce counselor, who tries to avoid women and their fraudulent ways, for a puppy of love that falls to Lady X played by Merle Oberon without effort. The discussion is wonderful and fun and the atmosphere is excited. Ralph Richardson was happy to enjoy too. I strongly recommend.
