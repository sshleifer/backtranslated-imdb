One of the most hit movies I have seen for a long time, the Bill & Ted Journey of Bogus is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. by Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this film: First, you see a dumb discussion, a very planned plot, a young idea. OR. You see people who have no skills who still find themselves in a very serious situation with their minds. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and becomes a very big movie. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of honesty, it's just Bill and Ted. This is a sharp fence of symmetry, but when you look at the film not as a comedy of running a screwball, but as an adventure involving two people who do not have a business to be in adventure, it becomes more.
