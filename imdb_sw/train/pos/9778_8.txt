This is three stories, "Shakti", "Devi", and "Kali", about an experimental attempt (or something like that) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which took people on a journey into them and in an unknown, and left area. a bit of destruction here and there, I would say. Many years later some of the damage is still emerging and waiting for the best time to show. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died in secret, in fact, was broken, and the accused was a person who could not be. It looks like this woman can lead a local spirit, or so she finds a sister of a murdered person as she tries to talk to this woman as a writer. Devi says the story of a boy who wants to "jump out of his skin". He is skinhead, freak speed, and is sent to see a mental expert who just happens to be a former member of this region, which leads to a good doctor to help a boy to realize his desire. This may be the best of three categories. Kali says the story of the nurse, who tries to “heal” this woman who was part of this province and allows some kind of demonic living in this woman, but someone wondered if she did or if SHE opened it because she could not live in it again. All three stories are good and waiting because you have never been sure of anticipation, and Columns and settings are different from those of the most common fear films that add attention. This has a kind of look at the budget and feel but it also manages to create a very good condition, for the loan amount. I watched this with my mouth hanging to open a good part of the time and when the real horror (and the cat) came to hit it very much. I found this to be a very interesting and misleading film and it loved it very much. Good good get, this, I would give you 8 out of 10.
