Maybe I am an array but this is quite good movies! I saw for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried out. Between that time and now (shy at the age of 15) I have seen more than 25 times and have turned on each one of them. Don't worry they are tears of joy! And not all samples! There is a lot of humor and it is fun in it too. Usually anything to talk about animals can be a big drag but in this film it is not a case. My special word of advice: Even if you like this - don't see the balance ... horizontal! I advise everyone to check this out ... you will not have compassion, no matter what age or younger you!
