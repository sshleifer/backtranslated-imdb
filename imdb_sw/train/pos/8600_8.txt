There was a hesitation from my section about what this film had to offer. For the beginning, the whip was not found right. Kiefer Sutherland had done very well in "24" and the preview was not found to offer any challenge to her or audience. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and some were not very attractive. When the film finally ended, I was not very angry because I saw a good thriller that could be better, had parties with the role they took care more than looking for the shortcomings of the story and given little service beyond character. We have seen the threats of this kind before, and that made the major conflict more challenging for journalists. As listeners, we do not want to stay the same story again. We want to see something different, happy and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong with hitting. From the woman of the first lady of Kim Basinger. He joins in sufficient grace and sexual appeal to make this part memorable. Michael Douglas has had it done before. Unfortunately, the president is a lot of non-care even finally. Sutherland is facing its "24" way of the hard guy and strong enough to make it big enough for big screens, and Eva does a pleasant job, like a stranger. Do not expect to lose many with fireworks like some of the classic ("North and North West" and "Provider" come in mind). Leave your expectations outdoors and enjoy the journey for whatever possible. Its okay.
