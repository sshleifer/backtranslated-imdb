It is not for people who do not have a quick mind or a drop of blood of Balan in their veins. If you don't have any of these you can't understand. And if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it. :) For example if you think Picasso is the name of a car made by Citroen, perhaps if you see Picasso painting you will go with it, deciding that it is the garbage work of the street artist. :) Then do not judge, before trying to understand :) Last I think it should be for each other with a clear mind. My N1 still remains the Liberation of Shawshank! And remember that not all things can be done correctly. Because there are things in this world, that any shape is not recommended.
