The sound of Tressa's voice was excellent! Tressa played the role of a female singer, while Richard was in the club. When he comes out the first step in the stage, and he begins to mix and lock up his things, making my soul run. His voice is platinum. He needs to make a CD. He has more fans and he knows. I liked to show her a performance in five stripes, which also had a star and Leon when she was limited. What? How can a little girl make a big voice? He is really wonderful. When you read this, please get my advice and start recording CD. Not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. I believe you can do it. Check out these other singers of one studio, lol.
