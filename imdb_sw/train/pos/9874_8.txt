In this 1943 film, Judy Garland appears to have not already been in for a long time with a lover of Van Heflin. This film was a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his Oscar winning the year before "Johnny Eager." Isn't By Spring Byington too old to be a widow of 5 children, and four of them seem to be her grandchildren? Singing and dancing is a great way to get it but the way the romance of flowers between Heflin and Garland was shown very much. It was the Gigi-like one where the little girl finally took off the foot and the composer.
