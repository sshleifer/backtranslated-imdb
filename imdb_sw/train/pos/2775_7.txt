The old films will know why I would call "This Person in the Flannel Greeton." Most of the most important Bible manuscripts are a huge shadow-what can shout and surprise here is how Peck, tries to raise awareness on various psychological and social issues and a spear carrying Neanderthals all over it. Like the Great Romance, it falls like unleavened bread. But there is something that holds about this film. In the entire Bible of Big Hollywood shows deliberately ambivalent behavior of the American average towards belief in the God of the Bible. Billy's thesis on Sunday is making it with an antithsis of H.L. Mencken through every script. Who gets the best in Chorus's heavenly design depends on your attitude. Alternatively, D&B has good performances with Peck (especially in the closing area of ​​fasting) and Jayne Meadows as his first bitter wife Michol, clear, weather (a good idea to take many steps in the morning or night), and translation The resurrection of the twenty-third Psalm.
