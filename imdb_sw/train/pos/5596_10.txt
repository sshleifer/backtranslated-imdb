"Planner" is the main film of Rome Polanski's IMO. And I like "Chinatown", but this is very original and unusual and interesting. It is also a great black comedy. Some people have shown this film that * is very disturbed by that later in order to be celebrated affecting people that way. Polanski plays a major role in the "Planner" as well as leading.
