This Belgian film, led by Tom Barman, the so-called dEUS singer, will not be accepted by everyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even plot. This movie shows only 24 hours in the "metropolis" (here Antwerp) and lets you watch and enjoy a realistic conversation, lead, humorous (Dario!, Osteopath Bruno!, ...) and pain (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) <br /> <br /> There are several memorable events: Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, KISS-fan, Windman visits osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Other misunderstanders did not understand it's very good and interesting in this film. They complain that this film is not a story, but it is an atmosphere that continues to look at and which will put it into it. If you weren't looking yet, you should listen carefully to music. Voice sounds are just amazing as Tom Barman and his dEUS group. And "ssst, please dicht him." (don't tell anyone)
