I met Insomniac's dream when I watched independent films, and I was glad to say it was not disappointing. This half-hour trip to the journey I was wondering all the way, and the last was the best - one of those NOOOOO when that actually stays with you. I showed it to the population and everyone seems to accept the hands down. The little girl was talented and I think her performance was a show. He shouted from me, I can say a lot. Nanavati did a great job to keep this short together. All the pieces were there and you can tell them that they are a good writer from what they did with this script. SO is written well. It is of course the biggest part of the film. Redirect was good and acting was fun, but the most important thing here is the power of the screenplay. Good job for this girl, I can wait to see more!
