There are some trivia which should be explained on the early location in the movie where Homer checks on December 6, 1957 (at least that is the video used on television that he was watching) which showed the launch of Vangard, which failed. She is shown again to read or tell Dr. Von Braun letters on failure. Von Braun was at Marshall's airport in Huntsville for the Army. The Vanguard project was the first Nasa team which was recently the Goddard airport. The Army fled to Jupiter-C, which was mainly the US that made V2 technology, but it worked to establish a satellite to cope with the success of Russia and Sputnik. This error may have been made by Homer, because of the features of Von Braun, but his team did not attempt to fail. In fact, Redstone's stone was flying from 52 and was the first American man who was tested, used by the Shepard aircraft, as well as Grissom. This is why this film is very good, as well as hope it will encourage people to read and identify these trivia bits, and in the process of seeing what has been done, and led to do more.
