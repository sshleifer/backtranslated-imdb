Just caught on the International Film Festival of Toronto. This is a good story, told by force. The way of the hands-on-camera camera increased the size of these events (in the style of text, not the style of Blair's witch). Joel Schumacher shows they do not need a large budget to produce a promising film. Participants were strong, especially the actor with a focus on events in the film, Boz.
