I thought this movie did a good job. It was not as creative or natural as the first, but who was expecting to be. It was a very fun lotta. more I think about it I liked it more, and when it comes out of the DVD I will pay you money for very proud, every last year. Sharon Stone is good, she is always, even though her movie is awesome (Catwoman), but this film is not, this is one of those movies that will be put down for her life, and may be a classic in 20 as 20 yrs. Don't wait to be a classic, look now and enjoy. Do not expect an umbrella, or something that finds you and the soul touches, just let you leave your life and dedicate yourself. All, this film is entertaining and I recommend people who have not seen it, because what the critics and the box office say is not always considering, see for yourself, you never know, you can only enjoy it. I'm the tip of my hat for this movie / <br /> 8/10
