This is a good game! Well, maybe you didn't have some features that meant that Anvil's Digital is still full of good game. There is a certain degree of scholars (you can do business, take up arms and cargo away from a damaged ship, go to missions) however this game has a great mission. It is a great mission. Control system is different you use the mouse! You basically send you a spaceship around the system and make your work up! This match has a very good picture even in that way it was released in 2003. It should run well even on a specific PC. Stories have a great voice from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (seen in every computer game). Cling to the story becomes better and better when it goes. There is even a part of the race, where you and your opponent running your race around the course (involves you going to the ring). This section has taken time to beat. It adds different to the game. Some part is a little harder here and there but generally you can beat this game. Match has a working area on Net. Select some mods to extend the game. I've never played any of the mods. For sad sequel of this deleted, embarrassed!
