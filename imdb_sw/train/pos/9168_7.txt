this was a great achievement of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had was that I didn't like Zelah Clarke. I thought he was too old and made Jane appear to be worried. in the book Jane appeared as a very powerful character. I was very angry with his similarity. The part that is the morning after Rochester ask him to hug her and runs with him and always hugs me laugh. I think they made a bad choice in arresting him. but Dalton was quite strange as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre's precious sight. The other thing that made this version is not 100% completely the quality of the film. I know to be done in eight years on TV. if it were a feature film, with the best quality, it would be perfect. My main complaints however, is that Zelah Clarke was very obvious old man.
