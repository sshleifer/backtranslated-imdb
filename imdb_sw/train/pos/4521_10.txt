Julie Waters is always a wonderful but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this comedy-bent comedy wry on a transvestite who can not prevent her swelling, and changes she passes when she discovers. It looks for the opposite of greed, a sharp joke for the true knowledge and true knowledge, and you have the perfect ball when you do. Very good, under the key, feel-good, comedy
