Nina Foch provides a good performance as a characteristic head in this little Gothic nail nail. He accepts the position as the secretary of the London community (played by Dame May Witty) and his angry child (effective and trouble George Macready). Before he knows, he wakes himself to find himself in the sea which he has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call Marian and try to persuade the servants and the nearby townsmen to be Macready's wife. Of course this pair can only plan dastardly plans, and even though we know Julia finally run its trap, director Joseph Lewis builds real doubts in answering the question of how he can manage. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" has nothing to stylistically put it away from any number of films that came out at the same time, but I was surprised by how well-held together with the shoe's budget and B-movie pedigree. There is only a short time that you can have on the edge of your seat, and I found myself rooted to Julia as she got a low deal and began to drive her providers. In any exciting Gothic, the heroine would tremble, cry and dithered, waiting for his hero to come and save him. So I can't tell you how fun it was with the heroine in this film to use its brain and learn how to save it. <br /> <br /> Made well. <br /> <br /> Bridge: B +
