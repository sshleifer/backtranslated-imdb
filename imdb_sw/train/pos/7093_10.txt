With 'Twelve Meat' you need to focus on, but if you do so you probably get a lot of insight. I know I did. Stories are interesting and relevant to travel time. The virus killed many people back in 1997 and a young man named Cole (Bruce Willis) returns back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for viruses. In 1990 he was arrested and put in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who might have something to do with the virus. It also meets with psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe in 1990. When Cole disappears from a mental hospital when she is locked up and closed in a room and seen again in 1996 Kathryn begins Cole stories to believe. br /> <br /> The movie always plays with time. Cole makes the phone and left the message in 1996, taken later and "they" send someone. For Cole that person appears only seconds after the phone. Things like this happen in movies and so you have to watch. You can ask some questions but since you can not answer yourself is best to agree with the film. 'Twelve use' works as sci-fi, and other big pictures and dark conditions, and works as an excuse. You are not sure what will happen next and what helps the movie. It may have some error in the story, but since it is about a false thing as when traveling, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to enjoy it. That was an easy part for me.
