From modern understanding, sometimes it is difficult to watch old movies. It is unfortunate to look at the village wall wall library to remove its glasses and be pretty and stupid to defeat the person. Especially a poor and unstable person. He is obviously a player (I do not hope to serve him) who does not want to sit down, who just looks at the dumb women and calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after changing his appearance and his life for him, he goes to him only after he (claim) rejected by another woman and learned that Connie spent all his money on the repair of the boat. I wanted to stand up, not dismiss him! Its sudden conversion within a few minutes was uncertain and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from that subplot, I loved the movie. Can't you like to ride at sea? (You can tell them they were from San Francisco ....; D) Dance "practice" was good, look at Ginger Rogers deliberately fall and out of "correct action" was good. The location of the last dance "Face Music" with beautiful dresses and art deco was beautiful. And I was very happy "We saw the Sea" (though they used it very rarely, as they saw it their best song). However, the plot was too weak, as many songs (IMO) - and songs were the same, but play should watch the movie. I wish they could show some shots of San Francisco since it was a film that was supposed to put. It is also wonderful to see such a rounded film and the knowledge of what Hitler had already done in time. I am trying to strengthen all skills to emerge in a country with fantasy.
