Fido is a good comedy that deserves a general recognition, especially based on the common crap that is supposed to please us these days. <br /> <br /> As already stated, this is not a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that uses the undead to mark your fingers. Although there are some bloody cases, there is almost no gore and how this film is presented (feel good 50s style), I can imagine anyone being really scared or extinguishing with Fido & sick patients. <Br /> <br /> Although the general cast for good, I felt that Moss and Nelson came out. Humor is not in your face, but fails; there is a lot of attention to detail and I have stumbled with a few exciting in the movie. This is certainly not the center of the movie, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie succeeds in giving the black comedy to stimulate the heart.
