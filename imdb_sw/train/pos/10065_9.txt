This is a very good, suitable movie for all but very small, although access to small children has been destroyed (at least in the publication I have seen) by using an unfortunate English option! In the form of the film it is difficult to think during the set time - no modern technology is shown, not even the usual Chinese bicycle, just drab, close to monochrome, daily life, which varies and advertises the Opera's Seeraan and The fireworks of the ceremony. Even when the squadron refers to their departure for war games, this can be at any time in the past 150 years. But then we briefly see the car of cars - late 30s, early 40th style - and we realize that we are watch China close to the greatest shock, and that much of the world we are seeing is on cancellation in the cataclysm of World War I and the Communist Revolution. Which makes the desire of the main character to consider the traditions and traditions of the past more than hurt. But the film also raises issues that are very important even today, both in China and in other parts of the world: the difference between boys and girls, men and women; business, for various purposes, for young children; corruption in society; right; The importance of friendship. Maybe I read a lot on this film; but I don't think so! I also think it is a scandal that this caliber films are often not shown in the UK, when the output is passed as quality materials. <br /> <br /> But don't enter me to start ...
