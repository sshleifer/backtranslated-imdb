Red Rock West is one of the most unusual films that allow you to count all the time about what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is wrong with the killer contract when entering a small town trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is a bad person and nobody is playing well. Look at the short look and the country of singing Dwight Yoakam. This is a very good game sometimes but there is a short time. The important thing is that you will enjoy this low budget but the highest effort!
