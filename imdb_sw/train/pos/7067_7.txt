Although he is not well known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most famous 1930-year-old stars, a beautiful young man with perky personality and the sound of the most popular singing. This in 1937 was his first major film, and it seemed to be a bonanza box office for Universal Studios. Three girls of SMART include three daughters of a divorced couple who flee to their long-time father while their mother-in-law shows that she can remarry - and a strong desire to undermine her gold-loving partner to their mother. Although the story is small, the script is a wizard and expert casting has a neat screwball touch. Durbin has a beautiful and interesting voice, and actors of the same character as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson, and Mischa Auer everywhere. A fun-ultra-light for 1930 movie fans.
