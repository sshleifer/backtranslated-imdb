Several aspects of this film are coming soon. The voice is rather surprising and one knows what great steps have been accomplished by sound reproduction in the years to come. The language of dialogue is normal and unusual and acting still remembers its transformation from action techniques. Bette Davis always offers a consistent performance in all his films as he does in this preliminary work of his career. I feel however that somehow the focus of the cockney is not like facial expression. I think it's a cockney inspiration that you thought you can't be true to me. Somerset Maughan likes to make human relationships very powerful that will delight all who are running the film. As with most of the roles of his character, Bette Davis can change from a beautiful woman who deceives a full-tempered snake. Leslie Howard is well cast as an English artist removed by foot club looking for a partner and making a bad choice in a limited player program. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film the little doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They cross through the traffic completely unaware of many horns and calls they shout. This area probably means to be funny, but I think it's ridiculous in this worst movie. Perhaps it is known to send you home with a smile on your face. And after all we can see (and hope) is the end of happiness.
