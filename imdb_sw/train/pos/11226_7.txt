Star Trek Secret Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it is a fan who has made a series, available only on the web, and has friends especially with neighbors who have computer software and home-based cameras and sewing machines, such as Mickey and Judy they put once, put on the show. It's obvious friends and neighbors, you can tell. Most of these people are not the best people you ever seen, or the least, or thinnest? some of them missing their lines as they walk on marble? some of them have a strong voice, or do not seem to speak well at first place, because it makes it difficult to understand one word that they say. Still, you have to accept, for everything these friends and neighbors have put together, it's really fun to watch. Yes, some discussion is hokey. Yes, it's not unusual (though it's too cool too) to look at two Starfleet men kiss (though some scenes kissing seems to continue to continue.) Yes, you cringe a bit when they open a quote from ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the theme from the Galaxy Quest played at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We can get to it. Why? Photo is the first level. Better than almost anything you have seen. And sometimes, show or two really says story-wise ?? some of them are really real tears. <br /> <br /> The Frontier secret is the total pleasure of happiness in every word meaning? but it gives people involved in credit where the loan comes from. It takes a lot of effort to put on the production of this size. People, sets, clothing, graphics? it is a great effort on many parts of the people. We look, we come back, and we thank you.
