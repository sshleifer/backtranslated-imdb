I feel that Warners Bros songs of depression are going to be much more in the next few years. Yes, we are in an economic situation (or have been living under a rock) and times have proved bad. But we always have movies as a way to avoid our problems. In the 30 years, going to the film was very popular even in the darkest economic age. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one film that the audience gathered. When this music led by Lloyd Bacon does not come into the social issues of time as "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)", it is still a good display of talent. We have to wait until the end of the film for the three primary points of Busby Berkely, but it's a boy, they have to wait for me. Yes, Ruby Keeler is a strong singer and actor, and his hit is so-so, but Busby's publications "A A Waterfall" fascinates him, and what seems to be another girls' appointment, in a city of dizzying water. Of course, Busby's numbers cannot be done at one point (they reject the gravity of the gravity, for one thing), and they define a lot of the complexity of difficult events, with non-music preferences. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his music player (in fact, this person could not do?). He even gets to take from a leading, supporter of marine transport and fawn on the sex of Shanghai Lil (who is very little Ruby in China-girl wig!). She mixed with Joan Blondell, her lovely, loving secretary, whose Cagney somehow loves other women (until the end of the second, that is). It seems Blondell was just another woman whose Cagney was loved away from his wife. And you can see mutual respect for each area.
