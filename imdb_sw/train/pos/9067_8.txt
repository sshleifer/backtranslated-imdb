After being forced to sit for some real stinkers (Racing Competitions, Boy Shark and Lava Girl) - I was very happy to look at "Fried Germs". At once, I did not guess the end! It was exciting and entertaining and didn't mention tons of great humor, despite the head. My boys (6 and 10) all liked too - oh my age 45 "boy" had a smile to his face at all. This is a family movie that is not just a tolerance for parents. Relationship with a younger brother is close to real life. "He does not stop singing just to reduce me!" Also, the way a new child tries to have friends and how their friends are doing is the same as the children do. Of course parents should do a little act - but my popular events have involved father using his new position. Enjoy!
