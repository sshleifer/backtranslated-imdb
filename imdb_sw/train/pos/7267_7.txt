Curly Sue is 6 years old with many hair and life as a drifter. He and his father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to live on the street to become temporary artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to fly in front of a car at the parking garage when Curly will shout on the charges and walk to the victims. It happens to be a very powerful lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is exactly what he did. Not only the money makers make money, they spend the night in the Gray Gray floor. However, Gray feels that he gives them more so three of them depend on the spell. Gray knows only the profitable business rules and nothing about life. Who better to teach him than Bill and Curly, the skilled professionals on the realities of life? But, all good things should be completed with no life for a legal expert and a couple of con. Or is there? This is a sweet and wonderful movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple but much edgier, of course. Belushi offers a very unusual performance such as under his fortune luck and Lynch shines as a snooty but a soft touch woman. John Hughes, as author and director, shows us his touch again, as the script is alive and unpredictable. Just look Curly and Bill pick Gray out at night, without money, and see humorous results. What? Wish you a happy rest, for a long time promised and finally released, and a short time in the middle? This is your planned-to-order movie.
