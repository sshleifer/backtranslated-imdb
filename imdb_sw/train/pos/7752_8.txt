Barman wanted to make a film because he wanted. As simple as that, and succeeded. Not only in its goal, but also in making a good film, especially visually. He knows how to use the pan, the slow motion process, track shots, crane shots, etc. in a good, smooth way. This gives the movie a very enjoyable. The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who do not have the same thing except one thing: a party that all attend, which is also changing this movie. The beauty of this picture is not in question how the characters affect eachother (in comparison with the same, of course a good movie like Magnolia). I just don't think it was the idea of ​​Barman. The beauty is in different details of experiences that people pass through which makes or breaks their lives. Barman is very successful by telling these small stories describing a little experience. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The movie's sound is also good, but it is not surprising to know that Barman is also a good music writer and singer with his dEUS band. Music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing that contributes to the sun, feel the smooth of the movie. Sometimes we hear funky / rock-rock music that provides powerful scenes that they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one flaw, and that's the last half hour. Was it time to run, which was breaking me? Or is it not the last fresh and accurate events than events until then? I can't see it ... <br /> <br /> All in a beautiful sun film that raises Belgian movies. 10/10/10 out of 10! It is / is (it is the temperature that passes through the hair of the girl in the daytime and makes it more beautiful, it is a new breeze that makes you relax when you go through a running party when someone opens the door, it's a heat that carries a fragrance from a beautiful girl sitting near you in the garden which met only one week, it's warm ...) <br /> <br />
