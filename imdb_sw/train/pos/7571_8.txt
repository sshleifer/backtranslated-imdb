This game arrives all over so far. I was honored to play mine on PS2 so graphics were very good. Sound sound was on the level. The level of difficulty is just the same. Wesker must be the best characters in the series of RE in my opinion. The stories were amazed and took many differences that I did not expect. The only level that this game deserves is best.
