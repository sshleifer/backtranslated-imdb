... can be seen as overstatement, but not. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand it - why didn't they make more shorts of music like this? What? Was it not clear to everyone involved? I don't think it is. Most shorts were made for commercial reasons only, and incidentally there may be artistic value there. This is one exception - alone? - it seems where to be a director had a vision and could appreciate music like art. Why did no one ever think of striking Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Good man, man. <br /> <br /> The ear had no sequels. If you have seen anything of the same quality please share!
