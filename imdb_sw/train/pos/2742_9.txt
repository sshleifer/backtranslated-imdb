Richard Brooks the best 1967 film of Truman Capote in the back of the back is a close piece of winning Oscar Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2005. They play well together (try a different night). It is common to find films made for 38 years that mesh is good. These two reinforce the truth. Although different participants perform the duties of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two pieces combine well. Only part of the author (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks movies is weak, because they give him a different name then Capote. I would recommend to watch the first CAPOTE, followed by INA BACK. It makes for a powerful experience!
