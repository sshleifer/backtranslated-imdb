It's really good. Acting was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was cheesie fun, the plot was stupendously fun. This was an enjoyable movie to watch and give your brain relax. The parts of the plot and quotes I found to be very creative. 7 out of 10. True why it was, it would be worth 10 out of 10.
