If Dick Tracy was black and white, the pope was not religious. To give a new sense to the concept of color in the film, we have a unique experience in the world of colors, and it is one of the few movies that have succeeded in doing so, thanks to a great script, good leadership, good performances (Al Pacino is amazing) and most importantly combining power of movies, the art of design and design of clothes. Using only basic colors, the experience is very different from anything we have seen before. And there is also a great effectiveness of worship for all types of gangster movie, disappearing completely from modern movies. In general, I see this film as a new experiment with a natural touch from a movie that depends on more and more on the old and more visible formats. 7 out of 10.
