SIDEWALK SITES are supposed to be a well-known film directed by Otto Preminger, a man who gave the world LAURA. And this time, he has the same star: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It should be said that Tierney here is less used in what is more than a role to help when the observation goes on Andrews. He plays hard hard, hard to use to deal with a bunch of strokes in a very large way until one night he accidentally killed someone in the process of arresting him. When a suspect falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he may go with an investigation into the murder but begins to feel guilty because he likes a daughter of kabbie (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks very little elegant for the girl who plays here and does not seem identical to the history of the legendary squalid story. The story takes a bad shape as the investigation goes further and finds that the murdered person had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero. At the end, it turns out to be a moral story and Andrews develop a conscience on its crime. It is amazing as a film film with powerful displays from powerful healing. Entering well in the black field, powered by Preminger and beautifully played by Andrews and Tierney, despite a little chaos of his character.
