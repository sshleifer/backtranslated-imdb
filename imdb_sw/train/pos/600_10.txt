Michael Bowen has a innocent boy who drives a thousand miles to visit his father-in-law (President Ray President), with a powerful windmill farm and ends up in a problem with his young boy's stupid, stupid and intellectual boy. stimulate the spiritual (yummy Clare Wren), thus causing trouble for the family already can not. A stylish, exciting and exciting Drama that was not given to the promotion and sent directly to the VHS and cable TV - which I saw first. It is written well, used well, and is quickly turned from the script that prevents you from getting your nails. I can't believe the consultants who did not previously see it. It's an unknown classic.
