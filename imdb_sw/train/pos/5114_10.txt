When Urban Cowboy did not have the waves and testosterone the same you can find the rodeo, provided the correct definition of that day and age, in Texas. I also think that actually watching this film, someone would have to live at a time and place of relatives that were made. There was good music, fun times and, yes, a few "bad and decreasing" on honky roads. The relationship with Bud and Sissy, as "two ships last night", were pregnant. When Pam struck a statement that Sissy wrote to Bud, it emphasized the tragedy of many real-life relationships. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the people sent by the staff did a good job. I thought playing the screen was well written and guided. Scott Glenn should receive Oscar for the best actor.
