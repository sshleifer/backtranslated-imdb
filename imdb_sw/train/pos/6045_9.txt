I was in the film too, but I don't know if it actually puts this place. On the way back from the school trip (2005) we stood at the service center while they were making a film, and we were asked (all of us) to run and shout out! Freebird! We were about 10 years old, anyone who has seen the film tell me if the part was installed in the film, it would be nice to know! I remember I thought the film had never happened, because it was 2 and a half years before it was released. All of your views are good so I think it's a very successful film, I can buy it, but first I would like to know if I am! : D Thank you
