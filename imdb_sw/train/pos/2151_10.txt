Funny. Sad. Haiba. These are all the words around my head when I watched this beautiful, simple film. <br /> <br /> It is rare that the movie transfers the truth, but "Will we?" completed that with grace to save. The good humor mixed with the constant pain made it made one of the best experiences of my movie history. It has left me with a sense of tranquility, but with a little touch of sadness mixed. <br /> <br /> And playing, yes, playing. Even if you're not an art partner, or you can't put one foot in front of another, the actions shown here will take your breath away, and make you want to register for classes as soon as possible. It was quite surprising, even in the showings of Sugiyama's (by the touch of the reflection of Koji Yakusho's action) when he was learning to dance the first time they were so interesting, as a child. And yet, this film was not quite about playing, but more about the manipulation of human behavior and emotions. We witness a shy person to learn to express his feelings through dance, a good dance teacher found for his love for art, and the personal growth of each member of the wonderful support. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotional. The love and passion of life here, are described by improper feelings of the beautiful painting of Japanese water as well as emotional and cultural power. <br /> <br />
