Orson Welles can catch me on my ass and every picture of him. Shanghai's mother is at the same level as her other hub, the Great Mabersons, the Touch of Evil, the Trial, and the Chimo At Midday Night. The plan can sometimes combine, and sometimes it seems to be moving perhaps a little too quickly (about an hour that was changed when the test exam continued well). It doesn't matter, however. You can't watch Welles movies and manage to focus on the field. His direction defines the main direction. Nearly any area of ​​this film can hold on to any other location he has directed. See the court location. Usually they are stock scenes that I can't stand on. Case for action, try to stay through the speech of Welles near the end of forced. In Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the depth level in the court area. Look at the juror who always reduces and forbids charges. Or just look at the lights in the area. I know, it's just blind blind Venetian, and that it was used frequently in film films and films of the era, but Welles gives it all its beauty. The discussion is also amazing. Welles had the knowledge, skills that no one else seemed to have, to make a criminal film with examples of the greatest poems. If he was speaking Shakespeare or banning the boiling lines, it was able to inspire the spirit. 10/10.
