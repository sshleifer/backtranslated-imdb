they have gone in 60 seconds. Where have I started, puts you in the film with good moves and some good cars. people say that it's not a good movie I do not agree that it has certain parts of cheesy but what is the action film is not recommended. I have given 8 reasons out of 10 steps to the comic aid if you like Rock or Face Off than this movie is the same as your spot of castle fortress work well with one of the most under-tested actors in my del -Roy Lindo. I think sometimes people look away from the movies sometimes you need to sit back to enjoy the movie and after the words they asked they did achieve what they show. means if you go to action is the action of action. Where are they trying to make a movie change how movies are being done and try to win each prize? I think they made a film of the action they had made, giving them a chance and you wouldn't be sorry.
