As Alan Rudolph's “Food Food Foods” slides slides on movies and humorous humor and makes me think back to 1996 when the “Night Night” of Keith Gordon came out. Now that all the Kurt Vonnegut discussion "can not be opened" it is surprising that it has found a good treatment of cinema (the other is "the house of five killed"). "Mama Night" is one of the most unknown ten-year films and I can't understand why. It's brilliant! It sits almost completely loyal to the book of Vonnegut (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to the poems that are unique to the cinema. How can the film's work labels work for any author? Vonnegut himself even puts in the last appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for better approval than that? Not just a good film, it is a well-written and directed film and is among my pick for the top five or American films of the 1990s. I would like to urge anyone to see "Mother's Night" - she does not even know the work of Vonnegut to fully understand it (like "The House of Slavery" sometimes does). It is powerful, affecting a piece of movies.
