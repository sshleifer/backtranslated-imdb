At first I saw this film on a concert at a foreign film festival, I thought it was exciting, interesting, bi-sex artist. So much Europe, so much Dutch! I recently used it to watch a second time and it is not hard to keep laughing on the head of more than the mad writer and the religious complex of sexual orientation. Get! This boy is freeloader, living away from the community. I think that the real reason for having these dreams of a "spider" is that his innocence is a refusal after a year of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars (and bed) with visitors! Not only do the wonders of (probably free of charge) losing stories (conversion of guilt trips) but he is very cheap to pay for haircut, so he hits the owner of the salon. Then he has the courage to complain about the bill! But I also suspect the world has changed very much since this film was made. For a great deal it was entertainment to see some of the work of Jan de Bont's camera and one of the original Paul Verhoeven films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed much after all?
