This is one of those movies that made me feel stronger for the need to make movies all the time. Normally, I am a fan of movies according to the true stories. And this is great! In addition to Meryl's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and reputation, the great film material is a story based on. The story of a couple of couples who suffer from social and legal suffering, after having a great emotional pain in the unexpected and brutal death of their newborn child is truly fable of opening the eyes that shows the human side of fellow humans, and revealing the roughness of a very clean and legitimate society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves to be good and intelligent (women's emotional jury in the movie for example) are actually not more than a dupes of selfishness which, because of their beliefs and discrimination, shut their minds for any decisions and reflection even because of all the facts that are clear about their views. Another face of society known as "civilization" which the movie opens is a preference for the pain of fellow humans (without saying, this is normal, although this particular story continues in Australia), which goes as far as being real cruelty. You must see if you are interested in taking something big and maybe stimulating ideas.
