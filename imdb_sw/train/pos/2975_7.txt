Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the show 'South Park', come back with something completely different. They create a new game combining baseball and basketball. Another letter e in the head. This is how you play: you just shoot the ball when these two try to stop you from making easy shot.Sounds, I can try one day. After the game hits the street, soon becomes a great success. would he know that two young friends can create a game that has succeeded? <br /> <br /> My vision <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very bad and silly spoof full of slapstick violence, but actually offers some laugh and many entertainment. love laughter and humor.
