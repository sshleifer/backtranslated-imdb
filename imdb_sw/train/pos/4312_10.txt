If you haven't seen this beautiful film about life in the 90s (in L.A.) then you have found a special treat. This is one of the most amazing and most powerful movies that have taken place in life for Americans in the 90s and even into today's world. It gives everything from raising a child, hate (more than one way), love, adultery, an empty nest disease, selfishness, etc .. and the list goes on. This story creates at the end of the end and then there is nothing else that causes it to return to love with friends and family and love life. It helps us to dig into us and make us want what we want out of life. It makes us ask our own questions. What? We've done enough for others, do we like this, etc.. Sit back and enjoy the wonderful and emotional movie that I am sure others will enjoy for the rest of life. Watch Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover of good performance through all this film. These actors are wonderful and they really reflect the light and the meaning of the message sent to all of us. These are my 3th actors for life after seeing this film over the last 10 years. I am always happy. Also enjoy beautiful sound sounds and neglect counting how many times can you see a helicopter fly and try to figure out a sign for a movie? Hmmm ... I almost forgot this perhaps Steve Martin's very first bad role of working in any film that he had ever done. She, also works best in this film. This may come as a surprise to many of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy the beautiful film really do .....
