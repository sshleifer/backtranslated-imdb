But it is a hilarious kinda, at least as we grew up on Weird Al, as I did. It is the interaction of his life and work, starting with superstition and coming back to the original view. It is different in places, but some groups are still very interesting, especially when they go to Japan. Although it is not the same as it has been lost in the Translation, and it does not find love yet, he takes in the bottle completely melange cultural melange which is the life of Tokyo road. Weird Al probably doesn't recognize as a cultural expert who knows that he is; Perhaps the resurrection of any name can smell. However, this is a lovely movie.
