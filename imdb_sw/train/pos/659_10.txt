One of the last scholars of the New French Wave. For leadership, cineaste Jean Eustache sparked from the simplicity of the early cinema; for the story, Eustache sparked the passion of his hard life of love. Many things can be mentioned on this film - watchful observation; more fun; regular hilarious; run emotional ... etc. etc. In my mind, any complaints that can be closed against this film are high in its shadow and its power. Every film, writer, or anyone who likes to handle a 3-hour film without a sudden, no video-video video, no solution to hitting the soap, and no banal dialogue should be the point of seeing this film. Everything should be interested in: writing (bright, clever, funny funny), act (everyone, quite completely, is perfect in their roles), and, the simplest direction (viewer feels like an ordinary observer in the film) to make this anonymous film. That is of course the film that stays with you.
