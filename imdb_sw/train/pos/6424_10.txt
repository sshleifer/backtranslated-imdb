If I remember to have nine or ten and I love this film. It was a voice of round sounds of sound / comedy movie. It's a bad boys! All open filing but the coming of other twins give us everything out of the window and then the arrival of colorful criminals who dance and sing! Characteristics in the film are not a revolution but are still amazing. The film is very real and it was a great return to Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a gem as always with this is perhaps his modern career, he shines like the other side and provides the best comedy scenes available in Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Songs ... songs are all funny and interesting .............. confirming laugh when you expect it ... Amitabh Bachan surprised is very funny and will make you laugh like 'Bade Miah' .... his statement ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song .................. ... Hilarious.
