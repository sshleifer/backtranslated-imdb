This is one of the smallest features of Disney, in my opinion. Cinderella was the perfect return of the film's films of an animation film (as opposed to 40-year-old film films), and a depth of depth through a multi-camera cameras back to the film in another way. Although Disney takes a lot of stories, it gathers the idea of ​​going through the dress and putting stylizations — during the clear story takes place. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, with different characteristics. In fact, all the characters are some well developed, except for the Prince - left flat more - we know he has a sense of humor, and a good smile, but that's all over. As Snow White, Disney has a lasting effect in the story in popular culture --- in many versions of Cinderella, stepisters are interesting, not just as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character takes from their otherwise beautiful appearance. <Br /> <br /> Disney's fun additions: mouse! Also, respected continuous - Cinderella will always lose his shoe in the film. The addition of a volunteer coat and the following attack from travelers was always as frightening as a child - I remember Viewing teacher showing this with a black background and a great red light on it! The broken slipper shows the dislike of Mrs Lady Tremaine to stop her hold on Cinderella and accept the defeat --- Audley will continue to describe many of the retired disney Disney, the witch of Satan Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
