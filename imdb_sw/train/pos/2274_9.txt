Although I would like Kurt Vonnegut, not interested in spy stories and I did not know this. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my most famous actors since I saw the "Champion Breakfast" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film has brought me a wonderful surprise. Of course Nolte was good, but it was also a plot. There was little political deception, and more to focus on the question of ethics: to read its anti-Sememia information and secret messages to Americans, in fact contributed to the general view of the Germans (and, as it comes from later, Americans) toward Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to immigration? Obstacles are popular even if these words are never mentioned, even if they write. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings in full that he does not open, even in his memoirs. Internal conflicts of such behavior are not possible to show - but with the help of the best acting and photography, this film manages. <br /> <br /> There are other points, like humor or ironical use of romantic clich√©s (like a White Christmas song), which makes it quite different from American American movies. I recommend to everyone who has been attracted to the Hollywood film movies.
