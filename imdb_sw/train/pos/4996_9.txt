I have seen tons of HK executives, and this is the same on type. Action events are exciting and kinetic like anything you have seen in any practical film. Kung Fu is amazing, eye-popping pyrotechnics, work stunt work heart. The order is fully successful, grows tension and congratulates you on the work of the camera. This film is headed by former Corey Yuen executive, whose resume is included by some of the best works, including Jet Li The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing missing in this film is the existence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, a male guide, comes next to it. This film is full of archetypes instead of characters - a modern killer, a thief and a girl of bitchy, criminals of cackling. That said, Shannon Lee has a great presence of screens; he is great with fighting, stunts, and guns. When he is on the screen it's hard to take your eyes. He is good. Why is this woman not a big star?
