I haven't seen any of Chan movies, but this is really the best I have seen now. The story in it is not something special, so I won 't go further into it. What makes it special is the stunts, fighting, acting good, the feeling of warmth of humor. The movie has a bright Tempo all the way and you're just stunned to see it. All cool stunts (of course provided by Jackie himself) makes you want to fly around the bed and shout. It's just amazing! Even my mother was attracted to this beautiful film when she saw it. I know this Police Story can be very difficult to find, at least it is here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth trying.
