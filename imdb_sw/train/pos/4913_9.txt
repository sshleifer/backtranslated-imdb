The head overturns the content of this movie to some extent, which may cause other unexpected prospects. Speaking in fact, there is very little "panic street" seen here. In fact, in the movie very few people know that there is a fatal killer who can spread a blow to everyone and anyone they meet. After saying that, what we have here is a very well-written story and the degree of distraction that begins with a lot (because, unlike the people "in the local", the viewer knows what is going on) and that Elia Kazan's director builds very carefully. As an infectious killer is needed, one of the most interesting sidebars I have found is the ongoing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and the Warren Police Captain (Paul Douglas). At first, these two do not like each other, although they should work together. In the end, they have built a real bond of respect for each other. Kazan did a good job with it. All the displays here were very good. Widmark and Douglas were good, and I was so taken up with a very early look for Jack Palance to play what would be his role of "heavy". I have seen very little to meet here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came as a little flat like Reed's wife of Nancy, but her role was not the main thing for the story. All in all, a piece of excellent work. 9/10
