One of my best films ever, maybe because I was good at the punk area at the end of the 70's and I have gone to many concerts, but the film was a good and very good story to act with hazel and come and come with Phil Daniels. not sure about his recent Eastenders project !! The best performance for lots of unidentified executives who like you keep your eyes peeled you will see in many soap UK today exp: Carver out of Bill, the more I watch it the more they I spot, well if you don't seem to still have night and video, don't forget to dig the secret of nose with your nose and heavy eye shapes and white head of Mochania .... Enjoy
