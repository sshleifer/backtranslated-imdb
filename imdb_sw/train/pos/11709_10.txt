At the moment, for all the events of the movies out there, this film cannot lift up on your list of things to see. But if you know anything about the development of conspiracy, the reality, and the purpose that this film (series) had, would you like to understand my pov <br /> <br /> In fact, the specific details of the film are the issuance of the author, who cannot know what will happen at the end. But the film is accurate and true "scary" viewers in thinking about what might be. I am a Christian, not from this film, but from my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. Movies and possibilities that something similar to the environment shown in it can frighten a person by thinking about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to persuade people to believe in God, but rather, a way to consider. As a Christian, I know I can't leave behind, and thanks to this movie, I can look beyond the things on entertainment, acting, and film budgets to understand the depth of what the film should offer. This is a movie you should not just see, but feel with your heart and soul.
