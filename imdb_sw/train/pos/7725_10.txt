I saw this film first when it came out. I was almost 9 years old and found this all the most exciting and frightening film and unlike any film I have seen so far. BASIC: Safari is sent from the world to the fourth planet of the Altair, the star in the Aquilae of the stars to find out what happened to the colony of the aliens that rode twenty years before and has never heard since. <br /> THEME: Poor civilization (ie us) communicates with the remains of a great civilization, the Krell-200,000 years have been removed. "Seeds" of destruction from one civilization are presented to another, without knowing the first. The theme of this film is very good against Evil. I saw this film first with my brother when it happened first. I was just a boy with the events of tiger really scared me as he did the events of war and the invisible power of the creature. I was also amazed at how real things were seen in the film. What takes my mind as an adult though it is a fact of film "banned" and how this will be done when we do (if ever) communicates with a more advanced (visitor) civilization than ourselves now. High technology and responsibility seem to go hand. We should work for ourselves to gain knowledge and wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the positive values ​​of the movie. I learned at the last school that "skills are strong" is the best, in fact, not correct! Knowledge is the power "power" according to how it is used (... if used at all times.) [It's not what you know, but what you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> The total impact of this film can be made sometimes in the future of man. That is the knowledge in itself and in itself, it is necessary, we MUST have wisdom that knowledge depends on making sure our own destiny. <br /> <Many thanks to those who responded to the previous versions of this article and comments and modifications, all are widely accepted!
