Much written about the Mamet's "House of Sports"; most of them are good. I decided to restore the flick to see how you lived after 17 years and to be surprised at how much I enjoyed seeing it again. The film's success and strengths may have a lot of the most important of the most fun of the film; A good story with a good scandal. Mamet can bring its signature with a clear history on the film when it forbids us, viewers, and marks at the same time. He then elaborates the art of speaking only again, etc. at all times creating stories. "House of Sports", now it's a freebie on the cable, fits to look for the first timers and the same adjustment for Mamet fans. (B +)
