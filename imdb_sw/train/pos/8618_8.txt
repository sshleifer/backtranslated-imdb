Picture quiz: you are part of the modern armed forces during peace on normal operation and you get yourself thrown back to the opportunity to change history. What are you doing? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change G.I. Japanese in G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) for US aircraft crew, have a debate to stop the attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds you that Japan made the first and more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie. But contrary to the Hollywood counterpart of the Countdown Final, this sees its column through: cast back 400 years in the Japanese military battle, its peace soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back causes a stimulating history to try to make it by joining and warrior to win the country? cue a lot of tank and helicopter against Samurai action, including a very surprising unrelenting 25 minute war sequence with a cast of thousands and causing great damage to each other. And yes, there is a decline. Of course, things do not go as planned, and even fire forces will not stand as they expect thousands of soldiers. Even before that, soldiers fall between them and those who want to go home, those who want to go to war with those who want to rape and rob his hell. It is surprisingly surprising to think through, the narrow rock and the country and western songs sometimes are caused, especially when they hit the English lyrics being hit by Japanese singers who cannot pronounce words without letting them speak the language, but it is a flaw to be forgiven in good executive sci-fi. The UK's Optimum DVD is a good transfer of 138 percent of the minute version.
