I am ignored at all times with family and friends with my tears on the movies, and they were not discouraged when I looked at this. I cried many times but I believe I wasn't on sappiness. I loved the family and sang this person if he tried to free himself the only way he knew how. Denzel was as strange as always, and also Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I've never been recognized; years have never been good to them. My husband is not one to look at the movies unless they are a historical battle of the war (snore !!!!) He has watched the film 5 times now and I will need to get a DVD to look at it again because he is wearing out of the tape and jumped all the time I was watching.
