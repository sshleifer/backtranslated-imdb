I would like to know why John Amosi came out of the show, and he died again on the show again? I couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they go home and the trouble they faced. By the way, do you? Did they do it out of ghetto? I think the event with the black Jesus I liked. We need to see them getting a few good times. something that was not very often. I would like to show the show again. During the day so people can actually stay watching. I don't think a movie or a new show will work. Specifically not cast previously. In fact what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you !!
