But we others, who we love the beautiful story of emotion and emotion that is locked in order to raise a cry ... happy! Tom Hulce is as great as Dominick, a slow-minded striker who loves wrestling a professional and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long. Because of the schedule of Eugene's work, Dominick is alone in a lot of time and tends to make a call for improper judgment. He really wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and make his brother despise him. He leaves the church to pray at the same time and express his feelings openly and very well that the character is appearing in front of the damn movie even when it begins the truth. <br /> <br /> It's not about to offer anything here, but movies are very much sad and sad. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a day of field with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a great song that I can not mention here, which has nothing to do with the film at all but it's very strange .. but you hear on the bar I thought Tom Hulce he will be chosen for this film, because he was 'Amadeus' that I thought which could give him a track into winning the truth. No such luck. Liotta is only good but it has less emotional effect, but then it does later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that they do not have a great place here but it was good to give her a name for a small drama set by Pittsburgh about two brothers who never forgot.
