This is the only movie I saw Prince but it doesn't matter. And I thought he was just fine in the boy's singing I was missing. This may be his best performance. Music is good. That's why he won Oscar in 1984 for the best music for the movie (or something like that). Now has Oscar and Grammies under its belt. Although the curse gets the way with the film (just make sure the little ones or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should go out and get this film of your collection is not perfect unless you get this movie in it. What else can I say unless you go and get this movie now!
