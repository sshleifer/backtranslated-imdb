Netflix should mention this short item on the Silk Tab details. Great for every way to more fluff produced. This had very good Cole Porter songs and more energy. Silk Stockings turned out to be a great disappointment. Fred was getting too old for this kind of thing, although the drum and Cyd are very good. I will be looking for Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. What? Peter Lorre was sick when doing Silk Stockings - he seems to be very much in the number of working numbers and with few lines? I am so glad that I run Paree - Paree for a clean accident. It made all the experience more fun. Bob Hope, if "a simple song and a man of dance" is a fresh pleasure.
