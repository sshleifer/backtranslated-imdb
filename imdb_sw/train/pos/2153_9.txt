This movie was charming. Accountant wants more from life than the usual achievement. What works well, and makes it very different from the traditional dance movie is that it should not be "big" is about finding a way to express yourself. The greatest victory at the end is not winning the race, not the discovery of a new style of life, but the easiest way to do what you want to fulfill other parts of your life. No one finds their passion, they find their quiet spirit. Japanese history makes the humiliation of the secret and "secret life" to play for a well-known and personal football. We can see ourselves for everyone.
