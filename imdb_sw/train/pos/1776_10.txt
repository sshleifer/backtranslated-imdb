I hated the first part of this show ('Fighting Hippies') in 1999 that I restrained others. However, when it came to 'The Great Comedy Channel' I looked at it completely, and to my surprise, I found it quite hilarious (Motto: never judge the series of comedy in its first week)! In 1969, 'Hippies' Simon Pegg as 'Ray Purbbs', the editor of 'Oz' as under the ground called 'Mouth'. His friends are Jill, who lost Alex, and half of Hugo. Back in the late 60's, there was a sense of wonderful hope among young people, that they could change the world through the publication of magazines that no one reads. Instead of whispering in the hippies flower, 'Hippies' is very popular. Arthur Mathews's writings carefully considered the number of time-era icons - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the 'Oz' observation of the '70' observation. 'Alex' Julian Rhind-Tutt 'wonder' put me in the attitude of Richard O'Sullivan's attitude from 'Man About House'. It is a shame that there was no second series, maybe because of people like me. If you have lost 'Hippies', try it. Once you have passed the panic panic, you're in a treat!
