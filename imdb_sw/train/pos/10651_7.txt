Some films just should not be modified. This is one of them. Inside and itself is not a bad film. But it fails to catch the flavor and fear of the 1963 film of the same head. Liam Neeson was as good as he was always, and many of them stood, except Owen Wilson, who was not only impressed with Luke's character. But the biggest mistake with this version is that it has gone away from the story of Shirley Jackson in an attempt to become a great and lose some of the original film in the special effects of snazzier. I will also say that inside and in itself is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of fear in the old version.
