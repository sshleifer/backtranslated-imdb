This is a film about the deep and unanimous relationship of mankind. They are finally spoken, but there is a chance to change anything about the situation. Starting in Shanghai 1948 and free of the propaganda film gives us the Dai family. There is still a weight on the history surrounding the family. History usually has a weight in Chinese literature and a great film. A couple of married couples - Liyan, invalid, and his wife Yuwen live in one large family of a damaged family. The biggest difference is the little sister of Liyan who cannot remember the past family but accepts everything in a natural way. His spirit is as light as the two are preserved. In this seemingly beautiful world comes an unexpected visitor ... <br /> <br /> I finished feeling sad - but definitely the best film.
