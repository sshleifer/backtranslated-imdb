The boy and the girl are chased by the village fighter because the boy was killed (by accident) the father of the heroes (or anyone who was). They also travel through the conditions of many parts of Africa. Work in this film is not good (except for the elephant baby). But it is a very good adventure and not too much research, there is blood, body and weakness (which reduces little movie). I am giving this film 7 because of an African background picture and it's a step.
