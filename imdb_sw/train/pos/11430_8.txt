Unfortunately, because of the behavior of US viewers to avoid headlines, this film has not received a distribution nor does it matter to be appropriate. Its subtle nature of inheritance, identity, tribal relations and especially how colonialism destroys all parties, reduces the obvious tension, nostalgic childhood memories of childhood, and the freedom of its relationship with his "wife", perhaps only true "man knows. We can't even look at his mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I have given you a hook enough to make it, if you say French or as low head or not. I encourage you to be a hero, strong and aware as La P'tite.
