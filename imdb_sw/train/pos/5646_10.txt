Recently, when I was shopping, I saw a Gothic Indian coffin, and I thought 'I remember that!' I was using my bell back and looking here at CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (I was 14). I remember very much because it was awesome and strange, nobody could be afraid as Lucas Buck (with B!) No one has ever been. What is angry though they did the same thing on the box-set as time on TV. Episodes for a pleasant order, I kept thinking when Dr Dr left? - They did so confused. Yet these are not the authors, producers or directors of the fault (its people in the background are making money keep doing the same - Just watch the event like Carnivale and Farscape do not like nature in the studio !!!!!) - If you haven't seen this and you call yourself a Sci-Fi Fantasy, Fear, a normal game ..Fan = WANT. Nor did they say the same in SFX when checking the box.
