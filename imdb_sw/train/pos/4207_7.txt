Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) pick-pockets Candy (Jean Peters) a handbag that has a useful microfiche which is intended for a Communist reason. He is followed by federal agents who are waiting to call immediately with a microfiche on contact. However, Skip steals a purse under each other's nuts and thus began to hunt for police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want microfiche back. Skip can only track through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information on criminals. It is clear to Skip that what he stole is important and both sides want the film, but he expects to hold the highest price. This leads to Joey's hunting after him and a collision between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to give a microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It is a well-made film and has a good start to get you involved right away. It's very difficult how Jean Peters once likes to Widmark, but this step is as important as otherwise why he will keep Joey. It's a good film.
