Time and frequent, I have explained that if people do not want to remake or sequels to be made, they should stop seeing and instead embark on a free film world. After saying that though, the last time I saw an independent film I should have been easy for the last six months. So here is an indie evaluation that I had my ideas made on Youtube; Treatment. <br /> <br /> Right now, you can tell that the film goes through a avant-garde film which has telegraphed in its use of close ups, scopophilia and quick editing. It's proud of how it looks - and has the right to be. For the most part it is a very small piece of writing, but not to forget directly to the 180-degree rule with a very serious gun effect which is unlikely to be a call card for independent projects. <br /> However, despite these mistakes of the most amateurish of shots are actually a pleasure to look at. We have been presented with good use of props and sites, a good job to see and some of the atmosphere, of water, which is used more often because this is definitely something that you cannot see very often from the presentation of Youtube. This program is divided and although the basic foundation is very simple some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we see here is the work of privacy; you can't expect the action of the act directly and if you make it unfit for this type of film. <br /> <br /> Where the movie unfortunately will drop however it sounds. What you are going to hear is a distorted voice that often seems to be missing and bad is still an ongoing music, which goes to the bottom change and does not add anything. The priority paid for the images that the voice speaks clearly, and this becomes apparent when you know that you have just lost the four-sentence animation and you must go back to take what was left before considering. <Br /> <br /> So, make an hour, but the sounds and sounds are turned off. <br /> <br /> The last concept; Did someone else remind you of the "Doug Naylor" novel Red Red warrior? If you have a book you know what I'm saying.
