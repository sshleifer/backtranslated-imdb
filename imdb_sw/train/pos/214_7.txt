The former Vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the most well-known but they broke the hatred. More than 20 years later they agree to assemble for a special TV ... but see they hate each other. Brother Willy (Richard Benjamin) tries to make them work together. <br /> <br /> A great hit in his day and won George Burns Oscar for Best Actor Effects. I (somehow) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon so his builders did not leave. Some of these were funny but making jokes to Willy and Al's senility was not. I have never loved Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and one thing just bothered me the wrong way. Also her character here is caustic you get her patient quickly. All this aside was fun. Burns is just a great stop off one liners easily and even Matthau was good matching him. Their battles are the best guide in the movie. Benjamin is also as beautiful as Willy's nephew trying to make two of them work. For me it is worth seeing for Burns alone. This jump began its work in a great way and two years later had others voted and "Oh God". So, this is good. Just beautiful - it's not good. Matthau's behavior makes it very difficult to love her. I offer 7.
