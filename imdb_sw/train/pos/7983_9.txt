It is difficult to add this film in several ways. Everything works right here; draw, act, script, and movies are all the first level. For moviegoer, it is a moving story, of violence of love and redemption of mankind. For the film striker, there are many sharp techniques and technical features. There are some tactical combinations, and as discussed on the board, the end does not exist as authentic as one is the official formalization and angle of training of CIA agent. However, I used the last as a moving forward due to the fact that instead of tracking the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically congratulates himself for the end without considering the results. Like Jesus Himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, if it really makes a sense of scientific or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that the Creasy orders and the common ethics of bourgeois and beat bad people directly in its right efforts, which actually comes to deliverance for himself and the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is very important to check if you are at all interesting for a variety. Sound sound, good text, throw without losing, and a solid display on the board makes the film more than 100 (or better).
