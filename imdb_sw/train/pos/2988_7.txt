Basic and Barbara Stanwyk are only preserved by Stanwyk's performance. Myths and other exhibitions are very difficult and the film itself also seems to have fun today. The Bette Midler version is more interesting. She is Stella Claire, a free woman, who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in poor performance). He raises his daughter Jenny very well with Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do her well and ultimately makes a decision to change life. Through out of the film, there is a lot of laughter, tears and unforgettable moments especially between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason star star as Jenny will be the mother of you, though the rich have a very good influence on him. If you like Midler, Goodman or just a good film and a lot of feelings you will enjoy the Bette Midler version of STELLA.
