I heard a few friends one day saying that "Scarface takes ... some of the idiot tried to put another godfather in the first 80 years." Now, I always listen to idiots / watch CNN so I have decided to stay away from it. Then my partner gave me a DVD and said "This is # 1 and pelicangs", I was confused and tried. THIS IS THE FILTER OF ALL FESTA. It is more true than all this trick about stolen cars that are very expensive for the person of the area can afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There is even humor ... for example Pelicangs and 80s of light. Still, what is better than Al Pacino with m203? I give this ***** out of ****, perfect for Al or GTA fans: Vice City.
