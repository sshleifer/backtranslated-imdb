Wow. You saw this last night and I am still bragging from how good it was. All of these behaviors seemed to be true (though most of them are small, self-selfish holes) and a strange story - a middle-aged widow begins to ask a female girl - she felt quite well. On all the round displays but hats off with Anne Reid and Our Friends in North North Daniel Craig (the latter comes as David next Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? This is far from Notting Hill if possible. Thank you God. <br /> <br /> See this movie !!!
