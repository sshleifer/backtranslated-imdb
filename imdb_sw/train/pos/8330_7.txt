What is it? The most effective film which has very charm and the reason for the feelgood which a lot of romantic comedies do not. Einstein is carefully done by Walter Matthau, when Meg Ryan's Catherine is a memorable thing? better than I saw him in these films contrary to Tom Hanks? as a little scientist struggling to be identified. <br /> You do not need to be a young woman to understand the struggle of Catherine and feel sympathetic at once, and if a young man is easy to understand what must have gone through Ed (Tim Robbins' ideas) in finding her real love. There is a whole appeal to these feelings, even as I.Q. it becomes light, fun and well closed. Certainly not heavy, but if you look there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist was still a great spiritual; His words like something along the lines, 'If it is not possible, then why?' it says he is a believer in achieving the highest goals of instant appreciation. In this film, there are really crash questions? such as Albert and whacky sidekicks' intervention to Catherine's away from the stem-top-lip, James is not love (Stephen Fry? who offers this otherwise characteristic character and you can not help but feel for a lack of feeling). How much intervention is happening in our lives that we do not see, and comes as serendipitous? And of course, we would like to think in real life, in spite of what we often look at people in the sun, that we Edwards we have Catherines and Jameses should learn how to dissolve ice water in their veins. It's good to know that it can work within I.Q. innocent (and surprisingly, exclusively Caucasia) the country of Eisenhower-believe.
