Frailty - 8/10 - Not the title of the head and "Bill Paxton's direction" aside, this is a good old layout that is a stunning scary of the Bible. Finally, it can only end up being a cousin of Southern Gothic's Kubrick's "Shining" --- but hey, that's a good concept of entertainment. It also has a doozy of losing the ... and very moral messages. This is the kind of movie that years from now people will take a night at the end of the base cable and fear beejesus out of themselves to watch it. Bad master Bill Paxton had to go to hire himself to the star ... oh well .... it's still a good tax Satan.
