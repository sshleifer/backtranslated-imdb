Here is a kind of love story that I enjoy watching. And in particular, it is for two reasons. One, considers young, VERY young. People who are still young and love for the first time, or at least think. We have all been present in our life with the "Man in the Moon" is to reflect on our memories, perhaps to add up to more information and to strengthen more than any of us learned. The second reason is that it is a triangle of love. And I believe that as young people, it's very strange. And the story is very good that you believe the characters can actually be in love, or it's just new to love that they just believe that it is after a tragedy or so happens, they will believe for their whole life. Casting the "Man in the Moon" is full of talented names. It is a star Sam Waterston, who is a very good actor, who can act as a tough district lawyer with a strong father, still caring and wise as in this film. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young boy, Reese Witherspoon. You look at a little, talented look at the age of fourteen and think that about ten years under the road, will come to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast remove the major exhibitions and for the discussion of the compelling screenplay, are enhanced to look like real people in reality. If all that happened really. This is a kind of film that I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I would like to see films that make everything look real and not deception or unbelievers in any way.
