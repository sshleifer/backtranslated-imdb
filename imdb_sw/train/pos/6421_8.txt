"Men of honor" - a true story about the black hybrid of the Navy (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that all touches and imports and is part of the full cream of the new millennium movies. Wonderful work is the main reason to make this film something special and enjoyable, splendid experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is amazing as a bright, bright and insignificant Billy Sunday - a role written for him. This film with the amazing “15 minutes” (2001) is two of the most recent evidence that it is still one of the very artists of our time. On the other hand, “Men of Honor” include good performance from Cuba Gooding Jr. who has become one of the most promising actors since "Boyz n hood". "Men of honor" goes directly into the company "Jerry Maguire", "Good as it gets" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. he is a skilled and amazing actor and I am ready to get more films from him. "Men of honor" also has a good story line and probably the most exciting series of running history of the film. This is a good, interesting movie and I can only recommend.
