This is just one of the most beautiful performances of the classic Dicken story. The script follows correctly the story written by Dickens, and finds the perfect balance between the sky and the film. Viewers who enjoy any format will find a sufficient story of a selected story in their presentation style. George C. Scott brings a pleasant way to Scrooge's behavior, and it is very persuasive in character development caused by ghosts visits. I realized that he was able to overcome me to the point where I felt the old man, something that was rarely done in other versions. The best work done by the perpetrators adds much to this production, which is more fun than all the Christmas versions I have seen.
