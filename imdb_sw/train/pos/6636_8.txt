It is not possible to test this film. It is as if you will be able to accuse (or praise) the new born for his future. Rather look like a strong reflection on what might have been 100 years ago. Eight hundred years of movies and movies: what was a boy? I would like to reflect on what will be (creative) will happen if Europe is not interrupted (destroyed) twice with the XX century wars. On its ruins the fortress of the human neon of the non-creative and self-created circulation called Hollywood creates itself.

The French film was actually ready to integrate the original and innovative methods that can (if they do not belong) can change the history of the interior in other ways that they do not think. One is wondering what the history of the film would look like today if it was not stable and incorporated by the modern and inexpensive age of 80 years of Hollywood, which Chekhov could define as a reek of greed and adultery ...

The world .. *** Therefore, all stars in star stars and minutes of silence for perhaps the most magical invention of Human history (so far).
