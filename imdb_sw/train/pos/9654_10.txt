Stephane Rideau was already a star for his powerful tour in "Reeds Wild," and he is one of France's biggest stars in India. In this film, he plays Cedric, a village boy who meets with Mathieu's holiday (guest Jamie Elkaim, for a wonderful, unequal performance) on the beach. Mathieu has a good relationship with her sick mother, calling her aunt and sister (who has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two fall in love. <br /> <br /> The film's disclosure notes - which include long, legs and pieces of the present, and real time to move forward in the future - - is a bit awesome. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not reveal the time we live, and the line of story can be difficult to follow. But the stick out: the last minute of the 45-minute film is so ingrossing that you'll never take your eyes off the screen. By changing the heart and strengthening, this film follows "Thing Beautiful" as a must-see movies.
