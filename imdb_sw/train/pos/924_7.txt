The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: It's funny, a wizard and shows a great voice to do. The show is about the family of Simba who works as an attraction for Siegfried & Roy. In fact they are all practices but that makes them interesting. FOTP is not a kiddie-cartoon comprises the humor of ordinary adults but in a very narrow way. It is full of popculture and celebrity memories and many of them are very killed. I would like to give you 7 out of ten because it is really good to kill but not the original, I have seen many of these values ​​many times before, even in that order!
