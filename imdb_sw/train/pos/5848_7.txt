And I gave him on ..... ________> Why? Because bloody rides. When there were many MAN shows on that they were tied to games / games this show was unique for that had a story to interact. If others have said here it was before its time. Sadly this is why the show has been destroyed. They have left 4 DVDs and 16 consecutive events so far. I hope that more will come out. Does this compare it now now 20 years after the first occurrence? I don't know I still love it despite other animations, and that IMHO is just a flaw. The script was close to the highest level of competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope the DVD more or even a set of all sessions for the correct order ... DVDs are good but I don't think story these are in their correct order, but despite this show dropped.
