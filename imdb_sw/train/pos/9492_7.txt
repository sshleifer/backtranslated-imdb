This film was fun but for the wrong reasons. The combination of the mechanism of action is frustrating and makes the film a short time with a clapping rod. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable place together near the end, where Williamson says to Ginty, "surely you get closer to the boy!". I enjoyed this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for stories of stories that must be written behind the fabric in four lines and most likely to be released. A film with more than 30 parts has a loan list of 10 or more. It seems strange that no one else has a loan in the film, perhaps they had some knowledge about how the finished product will appear. One thing this film is going to be is that it is very violent, so that three times with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make a suitable film to see.
