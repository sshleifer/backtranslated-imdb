I have looked at this document twice - and though I am a great buff of film, many documents do not end. This film however had caused it. Almost every shot is perfect - say much more than the sound definition (which this document does not). <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is amazing, I can't praise it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would think? The most wonderful and best choice of interviews - the film's film specimens in China - the film makes you cheerful if you're really there. <br /> <br /> I am politically aware - and I have read several books on globalization so they had nothing in this film which was a surprise to me. However, it has made me think a lot. I love so much, that this world was the best place. <br /> <br /> Dossi million for the film manufacturer - and thanks for making this film too. <br /> <br> I wish everyone can see it.
