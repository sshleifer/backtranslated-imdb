After seeing several Villaronga movies, I had a good idea about him - he concentrated on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about the rhythm of the movie. That is why, although there are good critics, his movies are not highlighted by a wide audience. In ARo he follows the same line, but actually improved by the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie. Speaking the truth, I slept in the first place, because although the first part provides important information, it is very slow. However the second part is quite amazing and makes the movie the best movie the best made by Villaronga. It is recommended.
