Saying the film is stretching is not a bad thing. I am interested in watching the film that has made it possible if this is sure to be done and this certainly has one. It is often the story of the Chinese man and his family as they have many years of trouble and much. But, I must warn you that this may be just about the repressing film from Hollywood in the 1930s - because the life of farmers in China was TOUGH say at least. Be prepared to look at the categories of hunger, death and disease. Just about worse than the ongoing tone of trouble is that leadership is played by Paul Muni. When a person with a unique knowledge, it is a real shame that Hollywood has always given people of European origin to play Asian leads at this time. If you're listening all the time, it's very clear that Muni is right for that part.
