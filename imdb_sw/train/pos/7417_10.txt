This beautiful story of an older son who comes home, and learn to love and become part of all the things that he came from home, is a poignant and moving. It shows a society that is perhaps wonderful to us in the Western world, and the family situation that we have lost. Stories are good, sad, and sometimes fun and drama. It has a sense of reality that we don't see it again in our western films. Work is unusual, since as the film goes on, it almost gives the impression that it is not acting, but a document for ordinary people. This is a brilliant guide and film making. <br /> <br /> Would like to see more movies and this director.
