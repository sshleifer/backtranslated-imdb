Photography of this budget production is amazing surprising. The color is muddy and brown and the picture looks very close. * And for the first time the movie seems to need to seize its users with beautiful sex pictures and abuse. Hans Zimmer's score is also a typical and bland component of this former composer, who cannot be translated. But if you want to watch more movies you enjoy the story of the family that encourages, the European version of the family of Edna Ferber epos Giant. At first you wonder why Clara married this ignorant man, even his character gets deeper and more history than he can judge. Clara announced the spiritual lesson of the movie, a great and moving story against the tragic events in his country. His daughter, whose partner is young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands the lesson and eventually tries to live with it. The route of the plot was constructed by completing the mirror was large. All actors are doing a good job, too. I was wondering "Who is thankful to play with Blanca?" at all, but of course, it was Winona Ryder quite a bit! All of them, this movie made me want to read the book.
