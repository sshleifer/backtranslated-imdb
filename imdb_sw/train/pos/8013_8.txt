Yes, it's another magical movie of Muppet and I love them all; The characters, movies, show TV show (is the best comedy or music TV show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they made a very unusual mistake and I'm sure to talk about a wonderful end! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to involve too much, in the US game, and to finish a relationship of love and marriage !! We, like all the poor viewers, feel free or unhappy with the absence of his pain, evil and trouble! So we all enjoy these stories that gather 2 good heroes as a couple in love without a legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So for both original and loved couples I bet that you feel safe , quiet and peace. So when you look at what the filmmakers have already done you will be mad like me! They made a very weak creature (Kermit) to dream of her daily dream, a very desperate woman (Miss Piggy)! This is a historical change for the American entertainment industry! And it was very good to have an adverse effect on the audience who just refuse to bless or believe or be satisfied with a sudden marriage (even a pathetic bottle did not have the time or the right opportunity to think or decide anything!). So it is not quite surprising when you know that this film is one single failure in their great movies, grossing 25 million just vis-Ã -65 million acquired and first (The Muppet Movie 1979) five years earlier! <br /> <br /> Only in this film took Manhattan, and my break too!
