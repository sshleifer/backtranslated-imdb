From critics and listeners were shown, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a major barrier to oil. However, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to hire last night. It seemed to be worthy to look. Indeed, it is not your American primary player, and it is not good to realize that it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all other movies, a breath of fresh air. Indeed, there were holes of conspiracy, but they generally worked. Firstly, Kidman was also skilled at very different, not very interesting, but still a very sexy role. He keeps making sure that he is one of the top talents in Hollywood. It is not just his Russian emphasis when he speaks English effectively, but there are times when he keeps talking long in Russian and if you don't know it is Nicole Kidman, you can never question his truth. Harrison Ford should consider "K-19". In general a little movie that works in spite of the awesome buzz.
