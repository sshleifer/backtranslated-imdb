This movie is one of those "WOW!" movies. Not because it's the biggest movie of all time, but because it's surprised. It's not just a T.V film, but it was in Elvis. I can say safe as many listeners if there is only one Elvis, but I can also say safe that Kurt Russel came very close to something real. It was one of the major divisions I ever saw. He made me believe that it was true. I learned a lot about Elvis's life by watching this film. And don't let the TV part be lost - it's really an amazing film! And Kurt Russel could be a twin of Elvis :)
