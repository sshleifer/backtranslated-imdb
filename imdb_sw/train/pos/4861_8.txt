Joan Fontaine is a "Slave In Tribulation" in this 1937 music star Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The program, which is in it, is about the British woman (Fontaine) in love with the United States, who has lost to Astaire, the star of the comedy music. The film directed by George Stevens, has an amazing Gershwin music, including "Good Work If You Can Get It" and "Foggy Day." The best location is the number "Stiff Upper Lip", which takes place in a happy house. The voice of Astaire's singing seems to be very strong in this film than it does in others, and has a couple of best dance numbers. Burns plays on the top client and secretary Allen is Burns. She is a hilarious master. The problem, as others said, is Fontaine, who needs to play with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could use twice as easily because he shows the drum for a long shot, and it happens among the trees. I would think it was twice the play was very hard. <br /> <br /> Surely the value of seeing despite its errors.
