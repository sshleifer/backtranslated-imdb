Unfortunately, this film is not available for a long time (if other posters have explained), but this is one of the most important dramas of the Great Depression, the hard drama and the touch of love laid out in the city of shanty. It shows the performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young who are on their best job, and is a good example of how the director, Frank Borzage, could create a close aura story of poverty, crime, and lack of social, which proves that the romantic and spiritual nature of his talents were. This film shows how love continues in the middle of the pastor and despair needs, and is a sure guarantee of life. This is the real masterpiece of the period, and it is a well-known movie.
