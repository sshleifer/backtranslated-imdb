I haven't laughed for a long time - although the film has some time of sadness too, especially when it changes from an amazing concern to the faithful and powerful. The characters are very realistic times, sappy sometimes, but it's quite realistic. It's not a fan of Jerry Springer show - I feel for people involved. This film is rather satire, and it does well. It is not bad that all of the cancellations were * hit * out when this movie is shown on public television, which takes a lot of fun from it. I am going to rent this movie to enjoy it fully. <br /> <br />
