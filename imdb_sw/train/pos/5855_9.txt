If you played "Spider-Man" on PS version, then you have seen all. In fact you should receive the DC version. Just set it a game graphically better; The textures are mild, the level is easy to navigate, and it has a much better sound then it's a cousin PS. I bought this game at the end of '00s' and is still going on until today. Good, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an excellent and strategic game but if you are a fan of the head of the Network ol then you can take this to your gaming library. Walking around the city like Ussi was never seen this beautiful and dying in the video game. If you have a Dreamcast, take this at an affordable price. The DC version is just amazing.
