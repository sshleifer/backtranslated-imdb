Not a writer or a critic ... I am a student who has seen this film a few minutes ago. And I want to thank the people who worked in creating this film! It is not the best or most .... but it touched my heart ... why I would like to understand myself ... it's easy and found. It is about love and caring, about the life we ​​have but we are sometimes lost because of physical things ....... Look at all the time we have but we are missing. ... why fu * k we do so ??? We need to live if they have died ... worries about every second and remember: if we do good things - good things come to us! HAppiness is true .. and has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in! Thank you very much for the film and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
