I wonder how this film (and many others has 5 stars and less when there are crappy videos of an average of 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. Fanboy's thoughts are facing again. When this movie came out almost everyone killed it. The old girl said this did not have certainly for many years later I watched this film and I found myself enjoying it even though it was a little laugh. Bay has brought it. At any level ... Stories: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is an old man of guilt used by an untrusted trustee Edgar (David Morse) as a pastor to catch a murderer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson). All of Alvin are mentioned by the bug put in his jaw after the accident. When these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after a gold brick taken in awist gone awry. Jamie Foxx is funny and also like Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a quicker who is much smarter than he leaves. Doug Hutchinson is similar to Bristol. He can be on-top sometimes in his behavior of John Malkovitchesque. He was better than he like Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is as good as a hard-working agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as the brother of Alvin Stevie. All with Jamie had a short time on the screen. The only movie file is some of the attempts to fall suddenly. The status of running the horse race is a high-top way but I didn't look away. The director went out there to earn points for it. With the bombing area and the treasure agent tied to the seat when the detonator sits on the door was very good. Everything in Bait is not bad movies for long shot. It was not pleasant, it's normal and I didn't look at me every minute. That should count something. Bait is one of the films that were hit under the 2000s. <br /> <br /> PS: for the attorney claiming that this film is very strict .... How long have you been living under a rock? I am sure you have seen a series of Die Hard and ALL movie and Quentin Tarantino. But those movies are not the proper violence? Weirdo.
