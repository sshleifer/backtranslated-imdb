This is a very rare example of films about male damage (partners). The film takes the headline so that even the total audience is not aware of transvestitism all the time they will be sympathetic to its main character. Adrian Pasdar is widely believed as Gerald / Geraldine and is not worthy of forgetting with this blue acting. The focus of Christopher Monger is very good, treating it very difficult, full of good news. Not a great movie, nor a film of "art", but a small, beautiful picture!
