This is a film that everyone should watch. Before raising the most important points (while South Africa is on the road to restore there are still many countries in these conditions now), it is best described when Denzel Washington offers, in my opinion, the best performance in its work so far. Kline also provides good performance, although maybe not as stunning as Washington's. John Thaw also places a good beauty as Police Officer. <br /> <br /> There are many possible places where racism can fall, but all of these have been avoided. It would be easy to describe white people as bad people and black people as good boys, but Attenborough hasn't done that. In fact, there were white characters who seemed to be bad, such as Captain in Soweto rebellion, but adding additional criteria to all the characters would have made the film for a long time. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think it needs all the hours and a whole half to tell the whole story, in fact it is a wonderful one. The best place in the film is that of Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole group begins to sing the South African national song, it is probably one of them, if not the most moving events I have seen. If you haven't seen this film already: see. It may not be well to see, but it certainly has its value.
