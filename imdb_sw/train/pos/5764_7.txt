I reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and wiped it. I believe I mentioned that "trouble" and "Turkey." Okay, well, with many levels, it is still Turkey. It has around the production standards, it is a plot that makes almost no meaning, and acting it on the level of play for third grade. That said, this has grown so much for me over the years as a kind of classic camp. In fact, all Todd Sheets' director's films have had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood in this regard: Watch them regularly and select the flubbed lines, continuous mistakes (the same zombie, two different places!), And other obstacles. It says this: The paper is a very good boy, and this time, one of its first products, it's not good, it's got a good. And I must add that good actors / good actors in the film are Kasey Rousch, although I may be biased, when I attended school.
