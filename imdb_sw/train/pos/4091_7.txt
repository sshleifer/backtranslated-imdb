I saw this film in London's 1975 movies and I haven't seen since. I found it alive. I loved its nature. It is rare that someone makes a film like this - and also sad. <br /> <br /> What it means, I was reading a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a film fan, I always "pictures" books like a film. Kinda "touch" them, you know? But as I read it, I thought, well, this would make a big film - but of course it would have been "adapted" - to the point where it would have little connection with the book. But I thought, well why? Indeed, it cannot be displayed on Sunday afternoon TV, but it was found on the movie for PEOPLE, who knew what was in, where did HARM? Of course, my civil liberty had broken down here. The director can make a real review of the "Black Hotel" film. <br /> <br /> In the best world, film management for adults should not be EXIST. But sadly, when I admit to having an adult INTELLIGENT, that freedom can be innocent, there are always those who are not concerned about distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and who may have the power to do evil acts. br>> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" enters the community. <br /> <br /> His appearance in the UK, the British censor released it. Despite the 'relaxation '69 on weakness, due to the theoretical film, he had a censor passed everything, he would be looking for a new job on Monday. But ... in those days, there was an alternative. G.L.C. This was the local city council and the department that was able to pass the film only to London, where it seemed to be the viewers were "more" than those out of sticks. It was presented correctly and hit. However, it later became "board" had only four people - three who voted, as well as "chair". And that day, one of the voters had died. So the remaining two voters and the chair sat down to see "Bete". One of the voters thought, like me, that the film was a hilarious and impossible to encourage evil acts with anyone. Another had no thought and only thought a piece of disgust. And the chair did not understand, so he decided to lose the side of FREEDOM. <br /> <br /> When the lost voter finally saw the film, they also thought it was disgusting, but it was TOO LATE! The film has received its "X-London" document and opened a mixed reaction. G.L.C. The film control board was recently disconnected! So "La Bete" was just opened in London and what could be called more to FLUKE! But I was glad it was. It's great! If you haven't seen, do it. It's FANTASY, and, like, it's more exciting than many things you see in these days ...
