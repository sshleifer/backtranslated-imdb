Then you should see this film, understand the truth. After reading the book, Mrs Duke is now a teacher for those with bipolar disorder; which was a manic-depression name. It is hard to believe that in this day and age, people still say others with emotional problems, or those who seek mental help. It is still emotional and discriminatory thoughts when, and this is unfortunate. In this film, the audience sees pain and suffering Mrs Duke has been going through, especially as a child. Most of us can remember from the "Patty Duke Show" of young people. She was the name of the household in America for 15 years. As he was growing in the 1950s, stigma was in full force. However, we see if he continues in his work, but the disease becomes worse. He goes through drug abuse and prostitution; even to marry someone who rejects the next week; and he has several conflicts and has his children and old mother. This problem happened before you had enough treatment, and medication. Recent studies by NAMI (National Union on Medical Treatment) wrote that a large number of American people cannot identify many common symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also given that one in five respondents in the election believed that people could control their AIDS without drugs if they wanted it. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) If you are watching this film, you will learn a true story of a skilled woman who could not “brag about bootstraps” and “get well” until she was taught about her illness, and received proper treatment. Thank you, Mrs Duke, for being a teacher against ignorance and discrimination.
