This movie is cheaper, it is delightful !!! And Ron Liebmann (Messenger Vaughn) provides a diatribes to enjoy more in the history of the film. I have 2 copies of this movie on the video ... for one, Ralph Macchio is essentially taking behind behind Major Vaugn while fighting "Hash". In fact you forgot to edit this error out of the film, but it goes to show how funny the movie is, when the executives themselves can not keep the same face!
