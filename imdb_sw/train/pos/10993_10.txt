This film is Gem because it goes to a smooth, but stable solution. <br /> <br /> I advise the audience that although it is billed as a thriller of Spy Corporate and Ms Liu yukopo, it takes for purposeful purpose but depends on speed. It's not about the explosion, the car chases, or the flying bullets. You must be patient and instead, see the details here. It's sedate because that's the main character. The viewer should watch and think if this story opens. I do not give the destroyers - because it destroys the check point. The program is what you read from other publications: the average collar guy, looking for change and adventure, a sign for the work of spy company. Just go somewhere and record it secretly and distribute the data inside. <br /> <br /> Take from there. This movie begins on a high walk - with the background of the company's disruption that includes itself, the base of urbanization. <br /> <br /> Then begins to speed up. <br /> <br /> Acting in all parts is good - and yes, some actions are characters of caricature. But they are all good, and they enjoy. And the red piano reverses is perfect as a smooth, soft head: All right is not the original. And last: Not all looks. <Br /> <br /> Get well and turn on the lights to look at this - and turn the voice: this movie wants you to listen to it.
