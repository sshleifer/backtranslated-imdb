"Telefilms" tend to fall under the low budget problems and a quick shot schedule, and why this film always tends to direction. George C. Scott incorporates Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, whirling all his winter trends, and still makes a simple character. The production value of this film was unique, never depending on the specific effects of boff or setting sound settings, still depending on the depth and transparency of shooting on the site and behind the power. The current stand alone.
