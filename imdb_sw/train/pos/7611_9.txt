"I looked into the eye of this island, and what I saw was good," says one of the main characters in winning the ABC's "Lost" award. The series can be summarized as a dance story about a group of victims of aircraft crash on an island that is unknown, but that would have been showing the show. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who are associated with the island, and themselves, and finally themselves struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it appears to be not an ordinary island, or - and not be alone. My first fear after hearing the concept of this series was a lack of new stories that can tell us after a certain period, but this has proved to be baseless. The story flows naturally, the talk is magic, the characters are remembered and implementation is good. The island is a characteristic of itself, and to understand these views you need to see for yourself, which may only show its authenticity and beauty. At the time of writing this review, only the first season has been opened, and it is filled with strong periods. My special dispute is that the second season seems to decline a little less, but fortunately it returns to the beautiful shape for the last events. If I can recommend a single television series you should follow the right now, of course it will be this. If you are interested in excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, very strong cast and staff, beautiful places, and an island that is more spiritually visible than nature, "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
