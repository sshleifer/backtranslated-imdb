Yes, My Love was Mario Lanza's village of popularity and is still popular today. His voice was firm and strong, in fact that MGM decided to use him in Caruso General. Lanza himself thought she was a reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book with Kostelanitz who wrote Lanza's notes, he explains that regular practice and sound teaching were Caruso for Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a good job in the story, but the story is not quite true; blame on Hollywood! I was struggling to sing his songs over the years, and to be fine until I lose my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the highest score of My Love is not easy; but good!
