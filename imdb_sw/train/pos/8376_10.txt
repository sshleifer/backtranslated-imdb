One of the best movies out there. Perhaps the movie was not much bigger, but it's a plot and a good idea. Great for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and great fun. One of my favorites would suggest to anyone who loves creative and creative movies. Publish World War 3 and fight in big robots, actors offered good performance and made it worth while. Seti is not surprising, but simple and functional to look for the overall film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. See why I loved it since it came out. It's not a common flick and not like anything that you have ever seen. Look and think as a child. It is a good attitude and very happy.
