Although this series lost only a season, you sat with me for 20 years. It was far from my favorite favorite cartoon ever. I would almost everything have a DVD or any kind that I can find. If you find any way to see this series I can use it effectively. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had the story of the truth that was found in many periods. It also made me more concerned with the characters and what had happened to them. Heck Goose character really frightened me sometimes. He was very strange at that time. The group leader also reminds a lot of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If someone has any way to contact the Creator / owner of a series of rights and can take them to the DVD please by all means!
