If you would like to return to the plot, this is your movie. It is not possible at any time to predict what will happen next. There is nothing visible or final as you think it will be. All characters are gentle and engaged. Cage is the best. Dennis Hopper also shows his positive side of sin. JT Walsh is perfect in its last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes the beginning of the superbly film in the cameo. I put this film as "I'm a real film, really, very bad". Not a few minutes in this film. A real sleeper. This movie has been hit down and, sadly, has been ignored.
