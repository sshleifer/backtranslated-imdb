This is an open and loving film for years. The film has Keaton looking for a woman's love at the age of stones, in ancient Rome and now (1920s). In all three cases, he is a Wimpy Buster ordinary and fights against Wallace Beery for his love of a woman. In the third period, I think I loved the best Roman even though I accept it could also be cheesiest. In fact I loved the events with the lion which was definitely a guy at costume with the amazing race of the car in the snow - but what I enjoyed most was the realist of Keaton. However, all three periods were better off with the film, while not the best, it is still a unique and enjoyable film. Look out!
