I watched this film for an accident when writing all the films I wanted my sister to record when I was on vacation and I am very happy to be with this. It deals with issues that most directors are holding, my only problem with this film is that it was made for TV so I couldn't buy a copy for my friend! It is a fascinating story about how people with eating disorders should not avoid everyone and how many include friends. I realized that although bulimics can maintain a good weight, it has a greater impact on their health that most people do not know.
