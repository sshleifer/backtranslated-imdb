Three stories of fear based on non-return Hindu worship members return home but have changed in some way. In the first story our former member of worship is now in the insanity and is visited by a report who wants to know about what went on in worship. That slowly go as the story is told to stimulate when the two are seated and facing each other. The author is particularly interested in what causes the death of participants. What appeared instead of a sudden stimulation becomes an amazing and amazing surprise. Things get very bloody. The second story has a criminal boy to visit a psychiatrist for a necessary cure. The patient appears to have a kind of agenda but a mental therapist is on the job. Again, things decrease slightly and get weird. Then there is something amazing in a story that is very written and awesome. The last story deals with a spiritual nurse who says that he can remove people from their hands with his hands. One of the patients is a member of an old cult, so a successful healing gets more difficult. Again, we are surprised and deviated. It has a very good place there. There is a good female front knowledge as well as a perfect male pride for some reason. I have seen the stories well written and the director succeeds in introducing each and every amazing story to him with amazing gory. Note: review of the German DVD.
