The first thing I said is that I have Jake Speed ​​Speed. I have seen at least 10 times. This film is one of the most enjoyable movies. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was arrested in Paris and the family has not heard anything. Together comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), to tell him exactly where his sister is and offer to find him. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. It doesn't work for money because it just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him closely and writes their adventures in novel. This film is a great adventure. It's hilarious, it is a step-packed, it is very good. I think it is a cult film and a very subsequent worship. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and provides out of one liners which you can't forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as a girl with a sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the man whose stomach has risen in the stranger, plays the devil, distorts the villian which only adds fun. In many ways, this film is similar to Indiana Jones, somehow it is similar to James Bond movies. Maybe it should be called Indiana Bond but whatever it is, it's a very interesting film.
