Fanya !! Japan is a real show and I love it! It was displayed in our country recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It's about Azuma Kazuma who tries to fulfill his dream to make Japanese bread which will represent his country. He works at the South Coast of the Pantasia Toyo and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. John Pierre and control Pantasia. They are fighting with other skilled professionals from many other countries and not just learning to make different types of bread but also learn to cook another food. It's a very fantastic and unique anime because it also imitates characters from other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and Piece One) and famous people from real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must-look for people of different ages.
