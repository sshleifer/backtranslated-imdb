I gave him 10, for everyone else seemed to like and would churlish not. The reason I have trouble you are adding personal opinion on the work of the Castle. <br /> <br /> I have seen the "Friends" and the "Tingler" (version of clever coloring where everything except blood is black and white) rarely "House on Haunted Hill" many times. Even I am not old enough to see them when the Castle was on his showman approach, so I can thank them for their own reputation. And when many come out as a second level, schlocky, hammy, etc., I believe they make him freeze. <br /> <br /> The last sequence of "Friends" is GENUINELY awesome and work today - with the premise of "Tingler" when you were silly, it was original. But "The House on the Haunted Hill" was SENDING. After using the home of Frank Lloyd Wright as out of it, Vincent's high price and solid cast, along with good values ​​and productive products - when I saw the first night of the night that showed at the end of the sixties, gave the audience's answers before and I haven't seen since. It was a little where the heroine is alone on the floor (if you haven't seen the film, stop reading now) and we're waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. Do you have a NO call to make a phone call, the camera turns slowly, and force viewers to change their eyes ... I say no more (my "spoiler" above refers only to this movie) . The quote is, I believe this was a DELIBERATE - not an accident - and when it happened, ALL viewers (including more people!) took the audience about MINUTES TEN to calm. <br /> <br /> Now that is best to make movies. It may be the person who displays the fire may be, but the "House" and two other films I have described were THE MONEY. The castle can be not Hitchcock, but it was not Ed Wood, either. <br /> <br /> It is easy to focus on someone's heads and forget to explore their TALENT. So I hope this document acknowledged that. I hope to see it.
