I loved this movie. I am Mexican and I was most at risk with that. In fact, I think this movie should be displayed on all police headquarters in Mexico. It is a sad fact that our police system has broken down as a corpse of 3 months old. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. The watchman turned the eyes of revenge. Grab is a good industry here (at least in big cities). I really want the real young people can suffer at the same time as Creasy of a man did his good work. That would be very surprising (Sorry, I am that angry!). MAN on MOTO is an interesting film that you can't miss. It may be difficult for some of you, if you are used to read subtitles (Mexico does it all the time when watching American movies) but it will be worth it. Some editing is a bit of fuzzy ... kind like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how Mexico corruption is). The movie starts slightly slower but faster begins to frantically with the second half. I swear you will be happy when you look at Denzel Washington to send the offenders. His performance is a few things of Beauty. Last (no destroyers, OK !!!) is a little sad, but I'm sure you would like it. MAN on Fire is one of the best movies of the year. A "must be" for DVD collection! 9 * out of 10
