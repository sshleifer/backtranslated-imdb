This is a very common film and probably unknown from Shirley Temple if it is not in any of its collections. The reason is possible because it has no end of happiness, unlike all other films. The music, though he drives one song called 'The world gives me life'. The film was released in 1934 with the original in black and white, the version with color and VHS, I would say they did a good job as the color does not look really, as opposed to me to say the color movies of Laurel and Hardy which are bad.The film is good for its age and the story has never been at all, I am surprised no one has tried to make a remake.When the film was a bit to talk like some of the events with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could say in five. do not go with this because this film has a real good time in it, especially when [Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals a necklace, and hides it in the Shirley's teddy bear thumb and tightening its actions, {while at the same time her daughter is singing for the audience in another room} dominated the most.Gary and Caroles edgy words face when they are exploring it is also very good. In all this is a good film from the early 30's, accepting its age.
