If you did not feel this film from Walt Disney Pictures, don't worry about it. It can be done with other films and Disney that mean educational purposes as "Reproductive Plans". It was produced with Kotex to teach girls before teenagers about menstruation, largely. It teaches only at a higher level, so it does not go into detail with the "Ram head" series / Reproductive System. <br /> <br /> The film shows "Wonderful Disney Things" such as page turning and animation use to tell stories. <br /> <br /> This film is not possible to get, so if you can get a movie, good luck to you and enjoy it.
