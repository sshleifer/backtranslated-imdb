The Brooks movie of what I've ever seen. I can watch and look at the tape 100 times. I laugh at my ** and cry at a certain time. It's a good and beautiful movie, and if you like Brooks - this is a must! For a short time - Brooks (billionare) gets a homeless road for 30 days to win the entire poor district from his opponent. The truth sounds, but at the end - it's about the warm relationship between humans ... Very advice!
