I own it Ralph Bakshis forgotten the Fire and Ice hub on video video OOP video. Equally one thing, this is better than any Conan-esque film that you will ever see. Indeed, it is cheesy, but who cares? It stood the test of time, and the only way that began to look cheesy is to compare the modern epics to fantasy like LOTR: FOTR (though I love the film.) & ice, the daughter of kings has been captured by human beings of Jarols (ice), when the only survivor of the affected village saves. It's not as natural as a Betty Nurse, but it's not a matter. It really brings an interesting idea of ​​the world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> As for practical events: good. They are well addressed, have sharp hostility, and have many sounds. Just watch the weather war, now THAT'S END! Teamwork and discussion: capable. True. They will not be used for Oscar, but it is the same as not getting your nerves. <br /> <br /> Animation is quite good. Shot on 3D with tips (I THINK), it looks very good. Much of the nature looks very deep and well-designed, and although character structures feel a little 1-dimentional, it's okay. Overall, this is a good gem neglected and will be more interesting than any of the modern "entertainment".
