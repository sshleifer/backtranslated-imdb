This film is a very good film. I will say that these exhibitions are sometimes weak; but for the most part, acting is very good. The only actor who beat me away from his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was wonderful! Tom Hanks appeared to be not sure for several points in the film but also was amazing. Paul Newman, good as always. This movie is the one that made the movie a jewel (and I use the word a few times). Conrad Hall is a real professional. If at any time the film had to be strengthened, you will see a very good job for this person. He puts every shot so that nothing is left. When the camera is still there, there is a postcard like quality on the screen. When the camera holds, each shot is planned to overthrow. But it doesn't stop there. It creates a choice of color and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way to brighten the lights is some of the amazing lighting work that I have seen. His work on this movie has done it. This film is on the list of the best movies and LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Stories People will say this movie is a 1930 gangster gangster, but I believe they missed the movie. It is a story of love about a beaten man who fails to protect his son from the life he has chosen. It is a very beautiful story that includes a good bond between two people who have nothing but each other. Writing screens is eligible for Oscar. Music Thomas Newman is sad but hopeful to enhance this sad but hopeful story. Music is some of the best and moving symbols I've had. Trends Sam Mendes is a new director and feel for an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he receives from his actors are shortages in today's film making. I'll be looking for the second film of Sam Mendes. 10/10 one of the most exciting and beautiful movies I have ever seen.
