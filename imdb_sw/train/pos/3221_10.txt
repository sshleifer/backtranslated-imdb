In several recorded films are made to a few for the Blade refugee, but one of the most obvious is the fact that 607 and its unit is a genetic building, reproduction to use fighters. But if my favorite quote from the film is, "you should make them smart and fast". Kurt Russell did a wonderful job, his facial expressions or the lack of cinemas gave them more means to talk the story and the rest were cast. Even when he is hit by Sandra but he does not know how to deal with these feelings, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or trembled at him when he was invited, and clung to him with a little boy who in many ways reminded Todd himself, and what he could be if not for his appointment to be a soldier.
