I have watched almost every Gundam / Meki animation that has been shown in the US and this far has a good story. The path of his plot turns around and turns to interest. Gundam Wing is a series of focus on politics and war. The series follows a group of five-year-old boys who have been trained in experimental experiments of Gundams. The Gundam fighters were trained to fight against the strong revolt known as Oz. As things start to burn between OZ and Gundam fighters, new political parties will set up and the elderly will leave. Old conflicts will end and new ones will occur. To find peace, Gundam fighters should come up with events happening in their world and end all fighting. But, people like to go to find what purpose. I recommend this anime to anyone who wants a show that has a deep plot.
