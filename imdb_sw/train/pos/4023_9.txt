This is a very good film. Acting, the work of the script and the camera is the first level. Music is good, too, though it is early in the film, when items are still cheery. There is no real superstars in cast, although several faces will be familiar. All sent there is the best work with the script. But it is difficult to watch, because there is no good end to the situation that was given. Now it is a style of British criticism by placing Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then separating them into cruelty in two countries. There are some attributes in this view, but it is also true that no one has been forced by Hindus and Muslims in the area to treat each other as they did when dividing. It seems more likely that the British saw only the tension between religion and that they were clever enough to use them for their own purpose. As a result, there is much brutality and adultery in this situation and this is not desirable to remember and see on the screen. But it has never been colored as black-and-white cases. There is baseness and respect for both sides, and also hope for change in young generations. There is a kind of redemption, at the end, when Puro should make a difficult choice between a man who has lost his life, but also loved him very much, and his family who has rejected him, and then come to seek him. But at the same time, he has no choice that he does not know of the great pain for him. This film carries the message that Muslims and Hindus have serious errors, and that all can be respectful and caring people. The fact of the division makes it recognizing everything more, since it cannot have genuine reconciliation on the Indian / Pakistani border. In this sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". At the end, we were delighted to see the film, although the resolution was troubling the heart. If Britain and the United States can cope with their own history of racism and this kind of freedom, they will certainly be better.
