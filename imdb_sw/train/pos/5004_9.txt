but as entertainment and random! Love it or hate it, but do not expect a modern plot or a cliffhanger to blow nail. Think like Seinfeld, but without monitoring and repeating the performances of wacky characters (well ... so far; I feel that I will continue to favorites while the season goes on). Comfort "is not for despair - it means to be interested in a small amount of effort on your part of your brain. Why does this show show everything I need in the program when I get home from work in the evening: the top conversation back and just right amount the "cute" for the characters for me to enjoy when I finally look up from the computer to see what I am. <br /> <br /> Funnier than most of the sitcoms today, calmer than evening in NASCAR. Can't wait for the next.
