The plan is terrible, real sad, unpleasant conditions for low-budget production, and at least, for German production. A little spiritual Indian, an amazing movie and a slasher mixed together. The development of the plot with the characters is good, very close to reality, without any label-atmosphere. It may be perfect, but unfortunately some of the things were a little disappointing, it should not always have a low-budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) Sometimes it's not over the average. Almost every actor looks like a layout. Some of them do good, or a very good job, but some do as traditional German court actors! But I was very disappointed with Mathieu Carri√®re's acting! His acting (in many of his old movies was good) here was less than average! But that may be the reason, why he today participates in Japanese soccer soap or TV series in private ways. 2.) Conversation sometimes is on opera-soap. 3/3 / 3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3) 3. A bad voice led to sometimes very difficult to understand, what characters say. I saw it on the DVD and was happy to be able to restore it again and listen again. It is caused by a set (a great hall like in a hospital or a group of esoterically) and sometimes a wonderful text of actors! But all of it, it's a fascinating, worth-looking movie, more than commercial movies, which is often worse.
