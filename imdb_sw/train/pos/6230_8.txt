1936 was the most beautiful year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection? Mark Sandrich 'Follow Fleet.' At this time outside Astaire is such a pain as Baker Baker, a pilot who just falls into the café of the seed of water which Sherry Martin (Rogers) fights with romantic sweet romantic feelings in everyone's ear. Yep, you thought? they are hot for each other again. This sister of Sherry's spinster, Connie (Harriet Hillard) jeopardizes all the good romance for the collapse of a friend of Bake, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); The kind of use 'em up and toss' em out the kind of guy, so forcing Sherry to review his view of all the marine in general. Irving Berlin gives an impossible class to the case with its classic, classy, ​​class and levels, "Let's Keep", 'I Put My Milk In One Basket' and 'Let's Say Music and Dance;' This guide is guided by God on suicide that is becoming a double-known and powerful force for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> Transfers 'Fleet' is a weak tad. The gray gray remains uneven but is now a tad thick look and not nearly as much tonal as different names. The seeds are still there. So these are things related to age. Once you sit in the lowest quality of dense pictures and sometimes more, the general feeling is more than acceptable for this film. Sound is Mono but it's very good. Extras include feature, trailer displays and short, but odd? No voice definition. Considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of Astaire / Rogers this is an uncertain look from Warner Home Video.
