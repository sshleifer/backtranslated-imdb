Physicians are a good journey from beginning to end, thanks to the great part of the magic produced by stars. Alan Arkin is wonderful in one of its best responsibilities in decades. Like any very good film, it is a journey that the theme is liberating and results of germination. I can't believe this film is very hard to find - I would like to buy it on the DVD with heart but I have not yet learned.
