I loved this show so much and I am so very sadly canceled I thought it was coming back, but just two weeks of stupid. That's terrible. I hate how we have never known how everyone lives. it takes. Bring it again! ABC has ignorance shows as Supernanny and whatnot but does not give time to good as Six Degrees. If they complain about testing perhaps maybe because they had a bad slot because this was really a good show, something I could understand and expect. JJ Abrams has been released, he is awesome, I would like ABC can only believe him enough to complete the story. I loved being thrown out as well. I couldn't wait to see how everyone could meet immediately. Everyone's story has now been completed, now I will not know if Steven and Whitney will join or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is also true.
