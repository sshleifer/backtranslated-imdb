One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that attracted the US web site during WWII, Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" shows a spoon of hobo placed on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little boy returns to the real sadist while making a house on the back of a dog, but Elmer warns the dog: "One more group and I'll give you!" At the same time, the shadow puts power on the dog! * And it's not the end! I saw that in one area, Elmer reads the comic book with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs often made stars but Elmer has never been in contact with Porky (unless you count too short "Any buttons today"). But to me, the thought of Elmer read about other famous characters from its kind that emphasizes the ethical nature of his world, as though he knew of his existence within his world even if they do not appear in this cartoon. > <br /> Of course, I'm going too far in my analysis. I am sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment, and certainly incorporates. For "I might get like this" line, it looks like that is something that censors had not allowed but somehow missed; I, for one, I don't know what it should be like. Was it sex? In the end, I would think that I would like to see everything, I would like to be tempted to find out more, instead of doing what the cat did (though it was a good trick). <br /> <br /> * Boys behind these cartoons certainly had something for TNT, didn't they?
