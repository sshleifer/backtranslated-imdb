I had only the worst day of my life. Then I faced this beautiful film, I looked at it, and now I'm ready to go with the streetlamp kiss. I need to admit, I just watched it for two reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. But it is very true. The plan is very clever and creative. It's almost like the comedy Shakespearean and all of his delightful misunderstandings. And indeed there are also ... VERA-ELLEN LEGS. The only lucky feature of this film is that the version I bought ("Classics Family" and Mill Creek Entertainment) is not the best quality of video, and I have heard the same about Alpha release. Brightness and contrast are very small, so many things seem to have happened especially when Vera plays in white dress. But I think you can connect to the control of keeping your TV to pay compensation. I can just think how it looks on big screens back in '51. The layout, clothing and color are otherwise surprising and delightful for the fun - a kind of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." In the case of romance goes, this is perfect. Not sappy, not made, not text. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Such a bad, you poor schmucks, your sad life will never be alive like this. It has not been created. Waiting, what am I laughing? My life gets as bad as yours. Oh hell. Time to watch this film again.
