I remember seeing this film of years ago, I think, BBC2. I would like to see again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? If I remember, it was a very powerful movie, especially a place that comes from a horse with gas masks. Besides that I can't remember very much about the story - that's why I want to see it again! I've used the web but I can't find a copy, which is common in my experience - maybe no DVD or VHS of this film on the market. Will you enjoy any help she can give me about this? Thank you very much for your help. Best, Albany234@googlemail.com
