I enjoy all the versions of this story but this is my favorite at all. George C.Scott gives an overview of the Scrooge behavior that others don't get. The movie shows more about why he become so strict. Scrooge changes appear gradually when meeting with different ghosts and events they show. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tiny Tim better. He is a good boy rather than playing with someone who is close to a boy like in another film. Anthony Walters still has every or more of his baby's teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is amazing as Bob Cratchit. He is a very good actor. He shows a person who loves his family. He is acting with respect or not as a powerful man who works under Swala but as a man who in good living lives because he has a family to give. Susannah York and other actors are doing their best to bring characters into life. Edward Woodward is the best Spirit of Christmas Now I've seen. They often play as a jolly character of Santa. In this he shows anger in the Scrooges perspective and actually makes Scrooge renewed again. <br /> <br /> Clothing and sets brings up the London life of Dickens. Good movie.
