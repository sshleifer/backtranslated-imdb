Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and star of Yvonne De Carlo in this funny, funny movie. Last Fred Gwynne is so wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), Lily's wife (Yvonne De Carlo), and her son and daughter. Sid Caesar is a hilarious owner as the owner of the museum museum which has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the Herman and Grandpa wax figures start to threaten the city everyone claims both. Two now have to delete their names before the delay. You will laugh as loud as I did.
