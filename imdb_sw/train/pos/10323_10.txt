This is an entertaining movie. A few publications I have read on this forum are written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort in the whole game. It was not made that way .... It is a very enjoyable film, which is done in language with cheek. All actors seem to be happy when they are playing. The process of struggle is interesting, broken and, above all, not free. What is known as “Death”, which was used several times, is not, as I read in one review, “terrible”. Several viewers were very important on the war of the war between Doc and Sea near the end of the film. Hey, show ... Again, I remember one and all that this is an enjoyable film. Each phase of this "war" was mentioned, which added a fun feature. Participants did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of these military films. Ron Ely seems to be popular in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another good touch is the only way that the ultimate destiny of the "wicked" (Sea) is dealt with. I promise you that if you try to take this film seriously and look at the value of entertainment, you will spend 100 minutes more enjoyable.
