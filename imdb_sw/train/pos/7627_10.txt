I remember watching this film in the past and after seeing 3000 miles in Graceland, it all came over. Why hasn't this been released yet Video or DVD yet? It is dirty that this movie's greatness has never been released when other trash has been. In fact this is one of John Carpenter's films that has never been released. I haven't actually seen on TV or since I watched it. Kurt Russell was a perfect choice for Elvis's role. This is a role played to play. John's breach of creation from fear brought this gem that I would like to like to TV again. It is good to act and be done well when singing is available. Give more of the biggest hits than Elvis and gusto. I think this was also a film that created a partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them perform a great movie show (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in small China, and Escape from LA One who should be given this before someone has made remake or its own version of his life, which I do not feel not only destroying the king but also destroying the magic that this has. If this is not given then we will have a Heart Hotel.
