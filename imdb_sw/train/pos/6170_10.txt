I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year, and I was troubled by it. It's a novel, a warm novel brought to the screen, very efficient, and well-directed. More than anything, he reminded me of David Lean's films, with his ability to deal with difficult stories, and his knack to create powerful scenes affecting you on various levels. The best movie I have seen in years.
