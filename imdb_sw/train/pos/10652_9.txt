I don't know why critics beat this film. I hardly ever agree with them however. <br /> <br /> Movie may be a little bit - it's not usually going to Horror movies! I even needed to examine myself to see during the day. I don't need to have trouble! ;) (Cinema was full of children too, heh !;) ... Liam was good as always. I also loved Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> <br /> The house was very Gothic and beautiful through spooky. Special effects and sounds were amazing. I also loved music symbols, especially the gentle tunes for Eleanor and his journey to save children, how he grew up in his order and life and finally gained his strength, peace and freedom.
