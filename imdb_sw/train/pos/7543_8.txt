this is a visual change of manga and very short conversation. it is a dialogue that appears in the words of the baloons as it was in the manga. The plot of this is but but clearly it was addressed. there is a matter of manga which this depends on available in English in a collection of explosive books, 'underground comics'', and has a real discussion of which describes a little plot than here. I recommend checking this amount if you like this, because it describes some of the "plot" of the film, which is otherwise unknown. This wise animation is very good, good use of computers and photographs is largely found. jumps in and out of events, like characters, cats and his death the death of a dead sister circles inside and out of a series of unusual pictures: boat, circus, desert. for only half an hour passes through a number of plots and semi-settings, which leads me to believe that the director chose several issues of long-term manga to deal with random, but only selected. knowing what is going on can increase the increase. this reminds me of the kind of things they played on the mtv show, the cartoon sushi, especially for a short time that catches the caterpillar of the man who was cut near the house. only in this case the cat resembles a more kitty and their adventure is extended including death and reincarnation with several themes (though not easy to tell what is going on). The dvd of this has the definition of the director and "decision-making", but I do not know the comments for those because I am not around. I offer this 8/10 for now, here is no different comparison with anime, and I hope more like this.
