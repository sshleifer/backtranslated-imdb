I think this movie is quite good. And I'm not just mentioning the breathing environment. It is about two English girls who are unhappy who choose to rent a Italian fortress to take a break from their unhappy home life. Finally all four women are paying taxes together, all with different personalities and different reasons for being there. In this very beautiful place they find the peace they desire and surprising that peace comes from meditation inside and resolutions, more than without. I also think it is strange because of the relationships that are made good and understanding. Acting is happy to look at itself. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
