This is a very dense, surprising, and hard film that clarifies slowly, revealing a great detail, like the attention given in the novel, and watching this "IS" film as a novel look opened. When I did not care about the author, if I felt that he was not balanced with all the exhibitions, this film includes some of the best work I have seen, and leadership, Summer Phoenix, it's amazing. His right and naivete others can find implausible, kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that critiki, but it's still amazing, because she is different from anything I've ever seen. This film is very good, made by Eric Gautier, and part of what is unique on this film is how it doesn't show when you could expect. It is always surprising, and despite its length, the film is not better than required. For 163 minutes, it's very short, for a mistake, I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. Filled with a short time that is just stunning, some of the best you are likely to see all year, and all this time add up to the end of the wonderful film experience. When family is special, Ian Holm is a brilliant, and what this film says about the venue is not found in the film since Cassavetes' 'Night Opening,' or maybe Chaplin's "Limelight." But, believe it or not, this film is "less" normal. I did not know where this film was going, and now, after seeing it, it still has great potential. This is a powerful, very exciting film.
