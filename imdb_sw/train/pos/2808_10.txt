This movie is not available, and is not recommended. It is - anger, because AIDS in the early '90s-was depressed. But his true message is one of love and patience. Mark and Tom were in a long, loving relationship. Their commitment to each other is evident immediately, and if the AIDS pandemic is increasing and it is the essence of their lives, you see the strength and commitment that is true of the heart. When “Silverlake Life” was originally released, I was very involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at the HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me if there was no other AIDS episode of his day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, they had a good experience that I saw every day in real life. I knew from personal experience what it was like to look for AIDS to eat away from the old people, young, healthy; seeing Mark and Tom's eye in the film was like watching my real life friends ruined. It touches me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.
