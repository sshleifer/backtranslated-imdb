I don't know ... Maybe it's because it is an amazing tax for Islamic religious action (hajj) but I just felt the movie hit down. I can only believe that the film has ever voted with only 223 people so far that they were given that the movie was released in 2004 and has won many awards since. The film is one of the sweetest movies.Reda, a French boy from Baccalauréat staying , he is asked by his old father to take him to Makka.Strange as it may seem (if a person does not know much about Islam) the father wants his son to drive them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia on a once-a-lifetime religious journey. The gap between the father and the child depends on enough words ('you can learn to read and write, but you don't know something about life,' an unknown father to his son) but some kind of bromidic generation is avoided. Father does not speak in French though Reda understands Arabic but can only answer in French. Although they meet many people on the road: "There is an old woman who fears the border of Bosnia to Belgrade, and Mustafa's (Jacky Nercessian), who helps them in Turkey's border, shy women wearing burqas on the road to Damascus" is always a father and child mixed . There is not a lot of conversations in the movie that makes it enjoyable for your eyes. You see good ideas in every city they go. The director shows you even the Blue Mosque and Sophia Hagia though movies are not available. I usually do not like movies that do not like to have a good conversation and that takes their power from the camera's craft but this was very good.With non-responsive information (such as an invisible French girlfriend) ) The film attracts a view. For a great work of art and recall this film is the beginning of Ismaël Ferroukhi.
