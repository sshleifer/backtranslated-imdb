Exercise exercise, emphasizing in claustrophobia. Japanese fun which includes difficult challenges to put it in two rooms. It's not quite a success, but it gets, amazing and doing well. Can someone get the film in some way to remind SAW? Two men were beaten into the room and fought against each other? but contrary to the film tries to stay with its clusters and put the hero locked in his cell in the film. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Others may find the doubts about what they have despised, but this inspector found it surprising. Sound and film pictures are available well. Certainly it is a good film to use to show a good video model at home. Just for the late night film, one is in paranoid mode. Of course I was up that night.
