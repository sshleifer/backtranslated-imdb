Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are strict. I have seen Kilmer on The Doors, however its translation of John Holmes is very good. Nothing compared with Boogie Nights which was a slow type. Wonderland is a movie that has the potential to show you a horrible story from a view from a boy who has just been taken in the opposite of drug and abuse of what happens around. At the same time, the behavior of John Holmes shows a very clever hustler who can go through the worst and worst situation around. The movie deserves more than once. Seventy-year-old celebration of drugs is amazing.
