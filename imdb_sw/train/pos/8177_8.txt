I wonder no one thought to make a film like this before. Fears are often more effective when you use unhappy life as a head. And no (except Steve Martin in Little Shop Of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Tooth abuse has been done before (see Marathan Man for example), but this brings fear into suburbia. <br /> <br /> This program surrounds a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who gets mad. Now our dear doctor did not play with the perfect deck to start, but it is dominated by envy and compelling-compelling she begins to persuade people around her. Doctors on psychiatric conditions are kinda close to what we see in the behavior of Micheal Douglas in the fall down, but with a terrible edge. It is written and led by the retired fear of Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, his witches and great flow. Also played to play with the soldier, is welcome Ken Foree. Now I think this movie can't work without a wonderful performance from Corbin Bernsen. After just seeing him in the LA Act, I was beaten by his acting. The dentist of the dentist 2 also deserves to look, but slightly less than compared to nature. <br /> <Bottom / TTKK's Bottomline - Movie that enjoys with certain events that will make you enter, planned punches and good performance from Bernsen
