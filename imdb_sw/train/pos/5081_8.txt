This movie was strict and even the lowest lobby, still fit to watch. Film begins as Claudette Colbert wants to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if someone has any trouble, the boy jumps and announces that Colbert can't marry because he is already married! Colbert insists this is not true, but when they explore it they find that the Right to Peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signature wedding license! Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette's ideas are going with people around him who believe in his purity. Then, when the first husband is supposed to be killed, all the evidence and doubt falls on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The movie is an exciting secret amazing film, just as I explained now is the first half of the movie. The following is amazing and amazing. Unfortunately, the conclusion, however, is a bit of a stop, as the leading power behind all of these returns "from the outside of the left field" - and surprisingly since it was unexpected and impossible to think based information presented to the viewer. However, despite this, the film was very good, I could even criticize the end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a good job as a sweetheart of "knuckle-busting", although far from him some performances were excellent as well.
