Finally I bought and added to my collection of "Show People". I can't give more information than what they saw the original audience and characters, plot and quality of this film without repeating their own words. Seeing cameo images, out of the most of the M-G-M silent mice of the stars, they have to look at itself. In fact I love the area where Marion Davies appears himself and has met himself and playing the main character of the film, Patricia Pepoire. Be sure to read his lips if there is no head card showing what he says when he sees Marion Davies but it is something of the effect of "I don't think I love him!" Pour the grain, pop in the tape and be ready to turn over three-quarters of the history of film making. Enjoy!
