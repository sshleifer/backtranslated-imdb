The investigation of the investigation continues on the back stage when Visa, on its opening night, continues to anonymous audience. The most unusual combination of music and murder is worth looking for the cast, its production numbers, and the invention of the film. Gertrude Michael has an exciting role play for the drama actor of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, with stars in the "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was also on the album 70 of Bette Midler). Therefore, when chorus girls are moving around, they are faced with investigator Victor McLaglen urging the girls while trying to solve the murder of an unknown woman. We learn quickly that the girl (Dorothy Stickney) likes Brisson from Far, that the wardrobe of the wardrobe (Jessie Ralph) is the mother of Brisson, and that step manager (Jack Oakie) enters everything. Most of the plots decrease between mobile numbers. The most popular song is "Cocktails for two." Kitty Carlisle also sings haunting "Where did He come from?" And there is a wonderful rhapsody that enters the unique number of Harlem's Duke Ellington! Release completely. <br /> <br /> Acting some serious here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is also very good too. Brisson is zero though. Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays a doctor, and also checks if you can see Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among girls show.
