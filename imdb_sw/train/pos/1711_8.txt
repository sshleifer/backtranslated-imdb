The second film of Abhay Deol, written by Imtiaz Ali, the efforts of Shivam Nair leader. It may have its first place?? She waits and wait and finally looks like a girl in distress and Ankush (Abhay Deol). They spend many days with him when he pulls him out of a difficult situation after another and eventually loves him. Then the lover returns! Aage pardey for keywords! Sound known? This is another effectiveness of White Dostoyevsky Nights and a little bit of borrowing from Le Notti Bianchi (very little - Ankush puts lovers away from telling a partner she is dead!). But this is natural and realistic (duh) to deal with very hyped and overnlown Saawariya. I wonder why nobody brought this little gem when we were talking about Saawariya as a few months ago. <br /> <br /> The settings of Delhi are wonderful - there is a flight to go through the old Delhi, shots of Jama Masjid from the roof, Circus Connaught, street and rickshaws (What? The color-light fixtures in the hotel are available to tell you this includes seeds with rental rooms for an hour! I see more Abhay more I love this boy. In this second film he is very good as a rental witness who is given the purpose of life with a beautiful woman. So look good, and when he screams he is responsible for the role, but I've found him feeling better. I do not know that he is in him as a good actor, or maybe he will blossom like a brother. Music and Himesh Reshammiya is not great and actually movies lose on songs, it causes damage to the story and does not live well and characters are trying to sing. Support is the best and I give these changes to White White on thumbs up. BTW - The fact that I would Abhay Deol's cute dimples does not have to do with my rating.
