Movie staple, adequate laughter and action for any audience. Since the last person who put on this film called himself Woody Allen incestuous and commented on the film, here I am. <Br /> <br /> The film follows the impossible duo, Johansson and Allen, if they follow the tip given to them by the spirit of the English author who recently died. Their search leads them into the house of the killer, and finally to the end of the horrible end. But do not let the fool, the film is hilarious and acting is good. It seems that if the directors reach a certain age they get good things. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to do some work to think more of their work. Also, due to watching the film in the exhibition of the exhibition, you can only tell people who love Woody Allen and already ready to make a backback. The second thing he walked on the audience of the screen decreased. There's just something about a person and he shines really in Scoop. Watch out, it's worth a trip.
