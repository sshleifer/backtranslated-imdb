Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a secret woman (Fay Helm) on the bar and let him see a show with him. He agrees that they don't get any information about each other - even names. Sometimes this is the best type of date. However, when he returned to his home, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife has been killed. His alibi is a mysterious woman but no one can remember to see him and, from this, Scott is sentenced to die for his wife's murder. His Kansas secretary (Ella Raines) has not proved his guilt and sets out to find a woman who can save him from death's penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good film and a viewer is 100% behind Kansas experiment to reach the truth. We follow him through other memorable events, for example, his track of the Mac's bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and claustrophobic place where Cliff player (Elisha Cook Jr) takes him to rely on, drink and play while fighting his friends. This is a clear example of the sexual desire that is part of the film as everyone drives very fast and logically for the time of the area. Ella Raines is good in the role of a woman and Thomas Gomez makes a lovely police. Alan Curtis started well as a mixture, a innocent man, but once he was arrested his work took the left side as he had a bad condition for Kansas for any reason. God knows why he stuck with him. The film did not stop the change who the killer is like we know from about half through the film, but this doesn't matter. In fact, it adds tension to the great progress of the story as we Kansas know what's going on and then getting hell! It is a good film and beautiful events but although Elisha Cook Jr has a role to be remembered, I never like him in anything that I see ... someone gives me neck-tie .....
