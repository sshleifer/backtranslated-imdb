Yes, I have a feeling and schmaltzy !! But this movie (and it's a theme of the theme) remain one of my greats at all! Robert Downey Jr. he does the same right for the role of "Louis Jeffries" which has been born again with the story (even though the following) is romantic and makes a person believe in a happy ending!
