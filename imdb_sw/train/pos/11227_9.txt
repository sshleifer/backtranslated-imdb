The boundaries of the secret-are more than the fiction of the genius - it is well thought and organized series to keep the world of Star Trek alive and grow. From a small fan of the current fan to a well-known net; The boundaries of the mystery has a bit of something for each fan of a star journey in it. Keep in Star Trek's Late: Monday's Saturday / DS9 Community and the Voyager Hidden Frontier takes the issue and issues raised in another series of Star Trek and stories set to use development characters, plots and storytelling. Star Trek Secret Frontier has taken social stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long-term job - real things that occur in the close quarters and spatial and conflicting conflicts. to love. Done on the "Green Green" studio; The boundaries of confidential bring a constant cast into the screen and inside your hearts. Most of the colleagues who work together love together with their love for their time and energy. The use of the design of green screens, props, makes and clothing works to make the hidden world of Star Trek rejoice and reliable. The frontier has gone to a place where few continue to walk in the false world of science, and have succeeded once they got there. Frontier Siri provides an excellent feature of a well-thought bonus site, with interesting discussion sessions, creative acquisition, production and characters and weekly fun conversations. I highly recommend taking less time load and check.
