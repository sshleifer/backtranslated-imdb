I totally disagree with other views. I was completely silent. I got an opportunity on this film and I was glad I did it. I am really happy. I can't find anything wrong with it. It's the script period is the original. Brady from Brady Bunch.But this gal can actually act. Put in Australia Outback is perfect. Interesting sounds. Big voice is Paul Kelly.God thank you Paul Kelly.The Cranberries is also here. I can look at it again. That's interesting. It makes a person think. It's (it was) perhaps better than nine of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters who were also out this time.Back Of Beyond is a delightful.Well's film. It can't find anything wrong with it. My first comment!
