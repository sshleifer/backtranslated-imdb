Michael Cacoyannis has had a long-term job but has an amazing reputation for his name, including some of the real duds like the cold satire of satire Day Day Fish came. Iphigenia, however, is clear. Used by Cacoyannis from playing with Euripides, it is the best delivery of a natural disaster and recently made its first television in many years in the United States with respect to Flix Channel. The film is hit by an epic but it is not appropriate to have a great film, and the emphasis placed on a simple story: by praying to gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is obliged to give his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), much to the destruction of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas ). Kazakos and Papas are both good, but it's a wonderful Papamoschou that brings the most interesting features on the screens, combining the lack of childhood and early recognition that she is pawn in a political game. It is highly recommended for fans of international movies.
