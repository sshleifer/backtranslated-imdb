That is one of the best-made movies and never stops me worrying all the time. The voice of the voice and the good work of the camera made by hand was very good. Often the movie's position will not hold faith like other, but I felt that the sound of this picture and time was better. Dakota Fanning becomes the most powerful in a movie that requires a child of the soul and has never misled me with his talent. For the sake of Mr. Washington and in fact Christopher Walken both are increasingly challenging to show the black sides of humanity trying to move to the light.
