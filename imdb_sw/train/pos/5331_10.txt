just watched it on the sky television he lost the first half an hour. I wondered if it was a true story to watch it to the end. there was no short time to say what happened to everyone. reminded me of speed but at the end of the day I thought it was released on the movie as we saw the following error. The flat we saw is that they remove the bonnet (hood) and then later there are two car shots and a police car in front of trying to slow down when the bonnet has come. it was with me along my seat when I thought the child would go to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge didn't decrease and then it was. I'm afraid I made a burst of tears so it's not bad!
