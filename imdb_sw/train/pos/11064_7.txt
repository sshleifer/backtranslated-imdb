"I will take you there" tells a foolish person who has lost his wife and another and finds an unlikely partner on the day of the blind. Unlike the most romantic comedies, this indie is a romantic-shades of comedy involving Rogers and Sheedy with a little emphasis on love. The kind of road trips are experiencing many fun and sometimes the pain continues to move, staying clean, and is looking for value for indie lovers.
