I have never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" came out, but the movie is obvious to see. Playing the character of the head, Liam Neeson brings that spirit to the role he played in Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a very good job as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one of the most likely to promote your skin. All of them, this comes out as well as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood released two films around back and returning to take a swipe in England. Very nice. Also star John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
