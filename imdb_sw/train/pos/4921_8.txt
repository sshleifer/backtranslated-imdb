If a road car is called Desire (also guided by all Gadg in action and screens) Fear In the Settings shows New Orleans which claims its great popularity - the birthplace of Jazz - it's not even worth mentioning. It was the seventh movie of Richard Widmark and certainly went a long way to strengthen as a good actor he really was rather than just a psychologist. Gadg himself appears in an unauthorized role as a morgue servant but the film is rich in talent starting with Jack Palance (still being beaten as Walter Jack Palance) as the local 'Big' 'tracker followed the Zero Mostel club, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig with a solid rock-solid Paul Douglas as a fighter who comes round to the doc of Widmark views. It is the most rewarding film so it has little to be seen. Catch it as you can.
