Yes, cameras were a good place at the right time. It is interesting to see how the world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor people in his country, can be respected in the United States. "Sin" worse, in my opinion, is caring for those under the barrel. What could be so bad about that? I have been fascinated by the US government's media response to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was really good (about 1959) when he praised Batista. Recently, Castro began to turn organizations into Cuba towards the needs of the poor rather than the oil cat. We are a respectable country, but why do the media and governments have problems such as sharing with the poor? If these people are "dictators," then we can use more "dictatorship" especially where the poorest poor live in the world.
