Great surprise, probably because I expected to exploit. This review was very reluctant, though all seemed to agree that the concept was gold: one finds his new girl is a great hero, and finds, when he wants to break him, that he is a kind of psychological. I continued to expect a fall, but it has never done it. Indeed, it does not act like its amazing clusters as it can, and chooses to be short when it would be better to expand the film world. But I can't blame it. Uma Thurman is as good as a superhero of bipolar, G-Girl. And I found, after several years of accusing him, that Luke Wilson could be perfect when he was beaten as a schlub. He was given two of the best exhibitions of 2006 (the other in very poor Idiocracy). I am completely broken on the words on his face when he and Thurman first have sex. It is one of the most funniest sex experiences ever. My true complaint is that it makes G-Girl very little psychological, as close to so. Maybe for some history I would be well accepted. I can forgive his mistakes, though, because I had a good time to see it. Standing, indeed.
