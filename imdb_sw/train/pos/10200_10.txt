All I hear about is how the animation was done wrong. It cannot be the same as what everyone expects, but look this way. What? Do you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that animation was made dry and gentle for purposes. It was good to see his behavior change in this movie, considering it would probably be closer to the stage of survival as we will get. I hope for a short time soon. If we want to live, I think we can be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I don't think the Lady Death could transfer the film better. But as much as possible, It is my own belief that all who travel about this film are bad DEAD. No pun is planned.
