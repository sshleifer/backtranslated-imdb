Today's sci-fi attractions are more than Rambo in the outer space with special effects of monster (frequent sadness such as the sounds of explosions in vacuum space). Although tame and standards today, the special effects of "Non-prevented Planet" were surprising in their time. Even today, they are still responsible. However, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason for attracting radio still has an appeal. Much of what went on until the mind of the audience. (What did Krell's creatures look like?) Since a lot of storytelling has not been disclosed or just canceled at the end, tension and doubt held in all movies. The end was also highly motivated and satisfactory. In my mind, this is still one of the best films (if not the best) made.
