Ettore Scola, one of the most refined directors and chiefs of the country's people, is not on the DVD ... (it's summer 2001 right now ....) Secrets of driving mind. <br /> <br /> This grand grandfather returned to the cinema in my city thanks thanks to Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and seeing again in the big screen after all the years of looking on video- tape ... A real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid understanding but even try to verify the point: I used my younger brother and I saw this film. He had never seen the film before and "did not like the old ones of Italy ..." As the rest in the theater was attracted to this wonder. Even in the last names, the hall remained completely quiet. <br /> <br /> This unique day is true. Wonderful sponsored. And great loss if you haven't seen (still) ...
