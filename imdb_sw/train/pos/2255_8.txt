It's not a bad war machine. Fighting events were good. Michel Qissi did his best to lead his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without the wrong language and blood. The screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line for the story that works. IT will be good to see something else from him in one form. He loves art and has strong women. It was worth watching. I recommend the film in all the game with the military lovers.
