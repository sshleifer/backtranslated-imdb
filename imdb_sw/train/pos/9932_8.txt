If you are going to this film you expect something that is not, you will be disappointed, like any movie. This movie has what Hemmingway described as "ice effect". On the face, his only cache of random videos were played together to make the film. If this was written in the book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you really try to catch it, the reason behind the plot (with some example of a trick) can very well go through. Of course the movie will need to see twice to get to know it. Experiments do not describe this film. The camera function and post-production increases the overall flavor of the film, making it artistic for some points and opening the interpretation to others (something that is needed in American movies like late). Although, in some place it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and very heavy for some audience, the movie will never be quite unrealistic. The only feature of the movie I would write as "needs to improve" is a voice selection. There is no good film without sound, and although the sound is very suitable, the opening is too small, and some rap songs in the film could be replaced by something more (heavy, rock or psychedelic electron would have made this film a real trip) ). The image rotation and power ... color palettes enhances another feature of "artistic", also experiencing events occurring in all films, this is not a film that you can miss any part and still understands. However, this also makes it more of a film that is needed to look at, and not one of you will get bored. 8.5 / 10
