Movie movie is really, really funny. Yes, it has time to die, it can be very clear, slightly decreasing in the second half and the story is an odd mess, but it laughs loudly in every way. And it's important to see Ed McMahon just like a good clans of throat. The film is in the same class as Elvira, Giza's Giza, another very awesome, you like the movie.
