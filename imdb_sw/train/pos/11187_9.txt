The Semetary of the Pet (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has moved to Ludlow's small town. The family has father, Louis, mother, Rachel, brother Gage, and daughter, Ellen. They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89, and can tell you about the history of Ludlow's history. <br /> <br /> Behind the new Creed house, there is a way leading to pet graves (written by pet sematary). When Ellen wants to go up to see it, Jud takes the family on a journey. That is the beginning of hell for the family of believers. When Rachel and the children are gone, the Ellen Church of death dies. Jud feels that Ellen is prepared for the death of her cat, so suggests Louis to follow more by the way, passing the pet graves. Jud /> <br /> Jud tells Louis of this burial ground, once used by Micmac Indians. The Church of Louis Buries, without the help of Jud. A few days later, the Church returns, alive, but it comes from hell. This movie was one of the two awesome movies that could be afraid of me, except for "Exorcist". The most extensive functioning of Zelda, Rachel's sister with meningitis of the spinal cord, or Victor Pascow, the spirit who tries to help Creeds make mistakes in removing objects from the dead. <br /> <br /> Music in this movie has an interesting section. At the same time it is sad and wonderful. It goes with the film with amazing. <br /> <br /> 9/10
