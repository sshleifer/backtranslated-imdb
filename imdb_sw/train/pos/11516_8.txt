I'm not John Cleese perfect (though I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I was a fan, and when I saw this stay, ignored, on my shelf at my local Blockbuster, I decided to try. I found it a wonderful surprise, and one of the experiences of The 50 minutes I have ever had the most interesting experience. The writing is an English model of "show show." In fact, as a sound skit, this was no place on the album "Firesign Theater." This adds “Wonderful observations” in the form of jaws that can create British everyday fanatics. The gift for mixing satirical lighting lights with “close tics” and behavior and time, and creators use them all for good effect here to show by Cleese for "Holmes" seems to have a great debt to "Inspector Clouseau" of Arkin and Seller, however Cleese has such a knack to a physical comedy that he more than owns himself to treat malware Here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a sensible but non-conscious understanding and timely delivery and delivery that has the best part of the film. I have never heard of Lowe before this (its history seems to be vaudeville and musical performances), but it says all of its work and performance as much as I care about. Some people can be cautious of "Wonderful investigation ...", especially if the UK is not recommended "tea tea". But I'm so glad I saw this before it disappeared from the front.
