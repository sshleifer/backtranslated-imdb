I saw this film about ten years ago and I thought it was very real. It was not as bad as other critics were making it. The fact that it was written usually depends on John Hughes that suggests that you can at least expect a funny conversation. (By the way, I also think Science Weird is quite good which also wrote at electric speed and Hughes). <br /> <br /> The film has to look very garish by using all the basic colors - reds, yellow etc. - which makes it look quite unique. Cast is also quite good. The Bunny Packard and the devil with the Salk Delores are standing out. The movie has got a bit but I personally prefer it for another 'Lampoon' series.
