I have never seen the 'Next Action Hero' show, and even read other comments here, he did not know that this film was 'award' from the competition. I was on the way and I looked at this, and I saw myself looking, I would try, to the end. Yes, the program has been made (Game Dangerous, etc.) but I was optimistic, and almost received, 'gotcha' - how the protagonist would like to beat the hunter at the end. I think high-tech decreased (GPS) and gave me a flashbacks of cool-sweat of Night Rider, but nevertheless more than overdone. The basic problem I had this movie was a SOD degree (Standing Unbelief) that was needed for the viewer. What? We really think that a person who avoids helicopters can run many fire bombs on a public bridge and no COPS indicate to explore? Would the limousine be able to make many restrictions in the Las Vegas cycle and no COPS indicate? Pleeease. Too much of such a kind - fun look, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much. The ultimate solution was good, but the end was misleading, and after the star of the Star Trek Star. At least now I understand why the act was cheesy - except for Zane, who has not worked as well as IMHO - they were winners from the real show. Just give out.
