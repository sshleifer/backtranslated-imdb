Nicolas Mallet is a failure. Skilled at the bank, everyone walks on it. Then his friend, the author who is no books he likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his master he is leaving. He expects to spend all his life making more money and sleeping with many women. And he can do just that. If it was not for the amount of death (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, this would be farce. There are many jabs in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. Jean-Louis Trintignant is a beautiful romantic love. Romy Schneider is very interesting. Certainly worth checking.
