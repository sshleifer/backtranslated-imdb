I saw this film 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they were showing this film as a double-featured by Tom Jones (1963). I haven't seen this film on TV since. I got to see this film because one of the stars is Jim funny and very talented, like Lusty's Bride. I believe that Dale now writes the stories of Harry Potter on Casette, but yet he is quite funny. This is a quick paced comedy. Not on VHS or DVD. Columbia photos should be passed through their film collection, and consider retrieving and releasing this film on DVD. Christopher Plummer is a hilarious master like Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also humorous as Ramble marine. This is a comedy comedy, a kind of one film no longer see, and great production standards. *** 1/2 stars out of ****
