A lot of information and a lot of digging, and if you have seen Zijiz, you know its speed. Even if you haven't seen many films or at least other films and similar directors mentioned in this doc, you will be lost. <br /> <br /> And the film list is long. Director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild in Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and Conversation (Coppola) There are some segway films like, Star Wars : Part III, Matrix ... but these suspects are baits. In fact, Zombi is not enough, but if you don't buy (or if you) mind psychological analytics, then you will be angry even to the end. But you should not be, as the layout, pieces, how the film turns to these parts, Zigaba points are never available.
