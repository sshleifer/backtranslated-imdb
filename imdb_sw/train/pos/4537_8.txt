I saw the film for the first time on BBC July 27 of 2005. For me it is a good interpretation of the man Conan Doyle, and I really ask fans of sherlock to think about it. I also think it's a movie for these fans if they agree or not mentioned. You can ask yourself to be A.C. Doyle a powerful man or covered himself with a question. Yet he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of the kind of biography? It's not down I put this power ahead, it's a movie you have to see - even if you're not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look, fun and have your own opinion.
