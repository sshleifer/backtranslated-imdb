Impact suddenly tends to be treated as a failure of the Eastwood art during his career when he established a good reputation as a director. The reason is not really the film itself but the view takes care which looks helpful. In other places it is actually allegedly more to Death Death than the original Dirty Harry film. One can say if it's so-late the day is a film about guilt, justice and payment. For me, at the end of the day is more sympathetic than mercy. However, in view of all these arguments it is easy to ignore that the sudden impact is a awfully well-made film. Forget "Go ahead of the punk, make my day day", that's an iconic but not original. But see the view of San fransisco taken from the air, entering the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are very interesting. Or look at the area where Sondra Locke visited her sick sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes good use of juxtaposition of surfaces. So all in all the sudden results are a very visual film which shows how the Orient usually becomes the director. And if I remember correctly it was the first time Eastwood set that on the screen though in the film's action of unacceptable ideology. Also, I think this is the first well-planned Eastwood film. Although Eastwood has many talents as a director, dramaturgy has always been its weakest point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) Space of the story leads to visual elements to be well integrated into the film and not distract from the story. The only thing that really hates is a farting dog.
