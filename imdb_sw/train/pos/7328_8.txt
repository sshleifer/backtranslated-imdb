I loved this film. I lost this thing that is not too bad to spend the evening. It was a satisfying experience. Some of the events were hilarious and have been so on a movie that was not intended to be just a stupid stupid comedy but moral and moral values. It rules for both errors. Lead is good but especially a boy, who also wrote and made the film. I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were suggested and made me care about what happens to them at the end that says a lot. The script is clever and involves and has a sense of pleasure for it. I think you don't want to look at this.
