This movie has always been my Disney film. Then 11/21/01 I saw the 30-hour aniversy of this film DVD. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is too big, It has 30 minutes more than the origin was missing. I didn't know this when I started looking. The movie made ever ever since. The cut music should be left. You haven't seen this film until you see the full version of 131. Most people say that music is forgetting. I remember every song in this movie with the heart, every song has its own Publisher, and comes together as a hole. I remember when I was young I had an "Eglantine" song on my head for a day at a time. With the "Briny Sea" (the song was meant to be married to a woman but it was cut out of the film) Please see the new 30-day version of the nonversion and switch to this film. 10 that is true.
