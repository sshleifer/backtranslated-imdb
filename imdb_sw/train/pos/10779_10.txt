Classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. It has a fascinating design that attracts the favorite characters. Rovers roads are a show of value to see, it's 13 short intervals, and if you can manage space to see, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that has all 13 events. I would like to buy if they did, and if they do, you should also buy. If you have children who love dogs, they will love road cars! Rovers of the road should be more cautious when they were revealed, it was an original and very unique one that should be more interesting than it was.
