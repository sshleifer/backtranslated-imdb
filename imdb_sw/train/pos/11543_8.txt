Neil Simon has a very active body, but it is an odd marriage that made him popular. This film works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Mattery have great chemistry. Support for this film is also stellar. It is about 2 men living together who come from the opposite planet. Script states with humor from this mode. This was done in some form previously. This is what brings it all together into a very good bag. Simon has done a good job, but this is his best job that made his job as possible. It's hard to imagine Simon playing this.
