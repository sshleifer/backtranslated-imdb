He always shared this video from the video frame. Finally he got round to buy for fiver in the sale and the boy is a film. The only awesome performance from all cases and has been done for beauty. Even from time to time so you can hear what the conversation is, if you are too far picking up the bits of the story. It is a real move, constantly exciting and very focused. It's not a lot of conversation but it happens in a way that you feel so much through. 9/10 from me. Must see.
