Okay, sorry, but I loved this film. I love all 80 of these movies, because you don't see it anymore! I want to ask you all who say this film is just to put an end to, or to imitate good, what is it? I have never seen another film like this, well, not fear yet. <br /> <br /> Basically it is about a popular group in school, who likes to do everything living in hell, so they decided to take this nerdy boy named Marty. It turns out to kill when she gets pain from one of their little ones. So, about 10 years later, with a group of friends who are hurting Marty to get a letter to meet High School School. But ... the only ones they receive! So they go back to the old school, and one of them is discovered by ... Yes you probably know what is happening! The only thing that distorted me was the end. It can be left, or considered properly. <br /> <br /> I think you should try, and try to be bad! ~ / ~ * ~ ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
