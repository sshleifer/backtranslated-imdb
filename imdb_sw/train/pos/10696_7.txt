Every time I see Nicole I love her more. I like a movie like this. The woman just stops, but she keeps breaking your heart. The first time I remember seeing this was the Human Bondage, the version of Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. Livestock about Russian accuracy mentioned in this film is small, it was good enough for me or anyone else who can speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people are not sure. Russian good kings were also cast. Finally, I must hit my hat with Ben Chaplin, as someone else said, plays a magnificent array, and there was a warmth between him and Nicole. Think, boys are paid for it, mind-blowing.
