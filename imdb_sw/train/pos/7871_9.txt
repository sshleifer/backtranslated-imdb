Mr. Bhandarkar is going out to touch on the issues of the layers and gives a true picture of modern society. One gets the impression of even the director of his original films like Satta and Chandni. The only issues mentioned in the last movie are available and seen in general here. Offer is amazing and one can see the judgment on each scene from many corners. To a large extent, movies leave you wondering about many things around. When you start changing things, you are about to get closer, but you lose a mark in many cases. It leaves a permanent feeling at the end. <br /> <br /> Observers are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani & Atul Kulkarni among others. Discussions are well documented and you feel close to some of these people. There are still some events that make you think about deep. These songs have been saved during the voice and Lata's voice for the most important song "Kitne Ajeeb" makes you feel that you are left alone in the middle of modern society!
