He enjoyed this 1936 film by many former pastors and William Powell, (Dr Lawrence Bradford), "Mr. Roberts", who played as a doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and they were divorced and still managed to live together and also fight at all times. Paula wanted her husband to investigate suicide and do everything he could to convince her that it was very important. Jean Arthur has a variety of nutty replacement and there are a lot of 1936 comedy and a way of killing is something you can never believe, especially for jockey at California Race Track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" played a major role as a bookie with James Gleason, a detective who needs help Dr. Bradford to solve this amazing mystery of murder. If you see this film, just remember it was released and led in 1936 by people in the audience in those days thought this was a good entertainment and it was true in those days!
