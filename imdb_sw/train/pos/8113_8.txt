This sci-fi title is very destructive after the editors wiped it after its opening in 1936. The visual is amazing to see, but the script allows many intellectual conversations about war and development. all. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both actors, come as a pair of chefs. Ralph Richardson is as good as "Lord" is the battle of megalomaniac. The Second World War was very serious in view that the world was the raging of the greatest crisis in human history at the time. I am sure that the war did not come as it was in the film. There are some interesting series of montage emerging time levels between different film events. Although it is not as entertaining as I expected it will be, this film puts you in your mind a long time after seeing it.
