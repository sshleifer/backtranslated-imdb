It is interesting that for 'Sand Lincoln' players have helped Ford players to give a little known, other actors than stars. This not only focuses on his films on Lincoln's intermediate behavior, but also gives the audience an enjoyable experience in Lincoln as a person of his place and time, someone has embraced, as each of us is caused, in both the issues and feelings of his time and find his way to solve. Not by the words and actions of Londa's Fonda but by the faces, the impact of the supporters of Ford is describing the story of the creation of the youth of Lincoln, the meaning of space in society and courage, and how people responded to Mr. Lincoln's words and actions. and put their faith in this person who thought they respected and obeyed. Try this test: instead of looking at Henry Fonda, the next time you will see 'Youth Mr. Lincoln' add your direction to supportive characters - what you expect, I will expect, to have a good advantage based on Lincoln and Ford. I would like to testify that Ford's story through the effects of the Fonda characters in Fonda can be appealed to David Lean when he told Omar Sharif in 'Doctor Zhivago', where it is the responses of respondents to Zhivago which actually speaks of Zhivago.
