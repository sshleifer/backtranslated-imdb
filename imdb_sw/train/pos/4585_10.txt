This movie is the best of Jackie. Still I can't get enough to look at some of his best stunts ever. I also love bad people in this movie (an old man looks like the Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike the other work of Jackie, this film also has a great story line and I recommend to all fans of Jackie.
