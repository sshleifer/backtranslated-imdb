I saw 'Still Crazy' to be an incredible entertainment, and not just for those who lived during this duration of 'late 60s,' at the end of '70s rock. My 15-year-old daughter looks at me every time I remove the DVD (don't worry, it's just three times) and she also likes. It is true love, pain and hilarious nod for the ages, and every actor closes its details in full. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad to turn to him like 'Our Love' to bring him more. Bruce Robinson was as wonderful as Brian, bringing real life to what can be a caricature of rock rock performances. It was interesting to see that Robinson has named himself as a writer. I am living in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw a movie that I closed for Billy Connolly in the local stores (lived here at the moment) and told her it was one of my five films that always love. He invited me to sit with him in the food court and talked about the movie for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​a remake of the United States directed before decisively rejecting it. Why destroy with nature? My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it was not widely known in movies and many people have also missed a wonderful experience.
