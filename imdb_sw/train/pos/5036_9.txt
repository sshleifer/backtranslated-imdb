Bill Paxton, of Guests, Near Giza, and the popularity of Terminator, wondering me and its beginning as the director of Frailty. He blows up all the jars, but there is one implausibility next to that which involves a FBI agent (Power Booth) which takes action from this otherwise cold and stimulating the stimulating imagination. Other than that, this film was very good. Bill Paxton has a father. He did not give the first name, but that is not the weakness of the film. In fact tightening the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a kind of sign of some sort. He has a vision one day that he said he sent from God to tell him that the world is coming to an end and he and his two children Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) should give them good spirits and kill them. Demons seem like ordinary people who kill them, and this makes the spectator wonder if Dad has lost his mind, or is actually doing the work of God. There are cases that show both points that increase the density and give the film even more. The story is sold by a flashback with one of those who has now grown (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks to a FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Power Booth) who is very doubtful and sure. After all not every day someone comes to your office to tell you who knows who the killer. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of changes, and Bill Paxton explains it beautifully by putting us guess without losing interest. Acting is amazing. Two teenagers lead with Paxton a good job together, looking like a normal family even if both are involved in the murder. As I said there is one possibility that involves the Booth Power, but it is not a big thing. This was a well-made film involving faith and family.
