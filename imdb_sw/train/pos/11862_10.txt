for anyone who plays video games here no one has found that the GTA: The City's Vice-Chamber in the game and other items including the weapons from a film connected to this film and this movie has led the game creators (Rockstar Games) to act others from this film and this way is one of the best 80 movies out there I recommend this to anyone who has not yet seen 10/10 no questions he asked
