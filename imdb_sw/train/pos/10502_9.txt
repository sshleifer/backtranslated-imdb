one of the most fun mario I ever played. The level is creative, there is water control, and good graphics at its time. there is also a multitude of mad bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels are sad, and if you come from some of the difficult levels and still, you need to get more successful to fight the boss, it may be angry. Other complaints are the camera angle; although it works well for a lot of time, it can be pain in a certain situation. as your great time for a fan of mario; this is for you. even if you're not a big fan of him, I'd still recommend this. His great game, and find what you need may take some time, but it's very satisfying. good to play in a short time to burst. it will almost hold your interest; it really holds me!
