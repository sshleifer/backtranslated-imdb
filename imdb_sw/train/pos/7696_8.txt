When the "Good Times" started in 1974, it was the first one of the most insurmountable families. It was the foundation of the poor family of Evans's Chicago and their conflicts to reach the end. Many parts of the original were based on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide families. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were powerful actors and had a good chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. he was the son of a ruthless child who had a good sense who did because of his lack of artistic talent. Thelma was a beautiful, bright girl who was constantly insulting business with J.J. Michael was the closest man who had been well trained on social issues and was scheduled to be a lawyer. In 1976, manufacturers made a big mistake by running John Amos, in fact killing his character. This has changed the direction, and not the best I add. The exhibition began to focus more on J.J. and his character as a buffoon that stirred the audience of black colors such as star series Esther Rolle, who came after the next season. Instead of a show that focused on the key issues of Africa and America that were present in the community at the time, the audience received a full-time exhibition match and the joke of oil. <br /> <br /> Once Esther jumps left, the quality of the display shows more. Although it was still visible, it was no longer a sign of breaking the ground which once was. Though Esther Rolle returned to the 1978 season, it became clear that the show was on her last leg. The last closed-up was closed during the season and the show was silent. First / third season: A. The last three times: C +.
