This period from the first little season aside to controversial and the whole angle of hitting the angle angle. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and guided is incorporated by a good executive. (Nicholas Lea makes X-Files its original though not as Agent Krycek but as a victim named Michael) I especially enjoyed building up and finishing itself. <br /> <br>> It is different but enjoyable. Look at any negative views that you can hear.
