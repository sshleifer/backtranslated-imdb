William Shakespeare would be very happy with this play of his play. Not only is the best version of the movie, but it is also a full version of Hamlet. Hamlet's Kenneth Branagh is just wise. Not only because it's written by Shakespeare, but also because it had guts to do the whole thing, even if it went over four hours. We all know the story of the Prince of Denmark and his plot to take revenge on his father's death, so I can go into the details of the story. I, however, will tell you that the best part of this version of Hamlet is not a set of breathe or a beautiful picture, but the interpretation of the behavior of each character. I am sure you will see Polonius better than a pleasant photo of Richard Briers. More, you can't go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi, from time to time Shakespeare's change is as good as an opponent for Hamlet. Of course, we must talk about Kenneth Branagh. He defeated the audience when he came to the area with the first meeting with Shakespeare, Henry V. He isolates himself with Hamlet. Indeed, the presence of Olivier was strong, but I think the performance of Branagh is wonderful. When you see him on the screen, it's almost as he knew exactly how Shakespeare wanted to play. How he was chosen for Oscar is a total mystery. At least a movie got a few appointments and even an unusual choice of Screenplay. I think they know good writing when they see it yet. <br /> <br /> All in all, you will not be able to get the most productive and rich play of the best Bard. Saying that technical issues were surprising would have been less. If you like to play and it's a Shakespeare fan, you really need to watch this film. Even if you don't care too much Shakespeare, these images will put you in the movie season. You can't think you will be able to stay all at once, but you will see that stopping this film will make you want to see it even more.
