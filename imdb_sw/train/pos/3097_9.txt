This edition was wonderful. It was hard and well documented by all the characters where they fit and be out of terrible. Even Jonathan's beloved lover of pride loved it. Since our airwaves are filled with crap like Idol of the United States and play with the stars, it was good to see a concert that was not so much opera so as. It was always amazing to see how each character could be linked to the next situation. It is really furious that we finally get a show that makes you think a bit and leave it out because of some strange number that most of us don't even have to be cautious. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be lost not only for most people but for some honest fans.
