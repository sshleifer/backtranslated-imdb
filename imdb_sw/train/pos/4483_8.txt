Everything comedy of music must be. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) did not act, and Frank Sinatra (such as Clarence Doolittle) did not score. The exhibition with them is very good, showing how much talent can add to the wrong plan. Sinatra "I Fall For Love Easily" is a sign of its future and future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" and a little Mexican girl is happy. Kelly certainly got her appointment as the Best Player. And there is the truth of the true lines, like: "Do you think the navy takes dopes?"; "Do you think anyone is singing a sleeping boat?"; and, "We got a little trouble, we took a little baby." The most enjoyable movie, the only thing to shake the dust of the second world war was recently concluded.
