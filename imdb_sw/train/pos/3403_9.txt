The strict production of Techicolor describes the unusual story of love between a woman with a great religious faith and a guardian of the Trappist who has stood her monastery, breaking her promises. The film opens at a museum conference in Europe, where an old student prays - beauty alone in black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is advised by Mama Superior to go into the desert to "find out", and lose her grief over her father who recently died. In the train car to the Sahara he resists the man who was very worried (Charles Boyer) - our old ruler. He recently at the hotel near the oasis of palms where he again sees our wonderful man worry if he is stumped on what to do when faced with a seductive girl playing too much. Domini becomes friends with him, although he doesn't know anything of the past - romance will soon follow. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic, and distinctive (by the way, almost surreal and even a little campy) - I observed that it is very fun and entertaining. Photography in this is very interesting - it is full of close and close face with beautiful shots of colorful caravans across the desert, the silhouetted figure against the sun's atmosphere. Marlene Dietrich provides well, though bound, working here and looks beautiful. Charles Boyer - not one of my favorites - is really very good in this, I think part of his suit and looks very young and very good too. Basil Rathbone is good here, unless given very little to do. Another great orchestral bigger and Max Steiner helps to keep the drama - all of them, the most enjoyable film.
