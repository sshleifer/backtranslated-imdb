Well, there are many ways to destroy the political thriller. They usually come out or come out very often, often with a system that is fairly and unreliable. But the City of Councils do not do or above. This program is clever, the story is reliable. As far as the characters go I will say this movie is the average average. No character appears where Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His Charismatic mayor is very good and proves that Al Pacino is the highest actor of American actors today.
