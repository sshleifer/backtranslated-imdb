There is much happening in the College of Students. A scientist is building an invisible toxic gas. Before he was able to achieve his discovery, a scientist is killed by a whip-wrestling player, who has a whip. After the coalition of the church and gas, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but the murder continues. Who can kill the fatal killer who seems to come and go as he likes and out of college? <br /> <br /> Working: <br /> <br /> - The murderer. What you do not like about a killer who is around around wearing a red color of KKK, full with red gloves. A white whip that carries and uses it very effectively stands up against a red red coat. Though the idea of ​​a murderer in a red dress, with an interesting head around a girl's school is very similar, it is one of the most horrible of the sins I have seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I would like to track down the music of the head of the Children's College. It has a jazzy, hip, 60s feel that I just love it. Touches Bizarre. In addition to the red coat of the killer and hood, the movie has a hot part of the pit, the pit of alligators and the top-up, the poison toxicity of the Bible, the set-up array, mini skirts, go skirts, and top-hair hair . I would like to describe it as a cross between the 60 show of Batman TV and Italian Italian. College of Women's College is a real treat for the eye. Finally. Let's just say that there are more twists than the mountain road. Only when you think the killer has been revealed, here comes the loss .. and another .. and another with another. It doesn't work: <br /> <br /> - General Inspector Sir John. I know that person was meant to be a comic aid, but its buffoon character has a very long way of screens. Previously, I announced alligators in the hole. And when they are a good touch, they serve a very little purpose. Why might all the problems and not use them? - Plodding Plot. Some Children of the University do not have a flow or rhythm for it. There is too much time in the film when things come easily to extremes. Better pacing would have made this movie more enjoyable. I have not seen so many of these German krimis but of the few I have seen (Phantom of Soho, the guest of Blackmoor Castle, Eyes of London's Lights) this can be my favorite. This has a real funky feels that I'm coming in. Although the conspiracy came much better, I could easily give them a College of Girls College 7/10.
