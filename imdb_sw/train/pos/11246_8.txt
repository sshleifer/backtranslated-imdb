Breaking the glass is a film that everyone wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. It is a very dark story about how the record company makes the performer perform their way and make as much money as possible. Watching some of 'finding a star star' of television shows in the UK and abroad I remind you every time this film. Although it is not a specialist on the subject, the winners of these exhibitions tend to hit a very big one and then come down from there. The film preceded these exhibitions though the effect looks similar. After fleeing his manager, he played very well with Phil Daniels, slowly but actually the record company changes his lyrics puts on stimulating and finally released. You are the stars of tomorrow .... Look at this and continue !!!
