Mel Torme and Victor Borge, at their young age, makes this film interesting - and especially to watch the little Sinatra, on the sunny side of the 30th, and definitely show them that this was "yes, I am a famous singer, but not an actor yet" step. Michele Morgan is angry, not in front, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has been completely lost to me. Leon Erroll is silly, as always, but generally it is very good. The 7 possibilities of 10 possibilities are about the "bridge" right, because for the combination of its best elements, as well as the lack of many stories, and therefore the absurdity, and the annoyances mentioned earlier - are the average average for the best. Most fun is from looking at three entertainment icons in their early years.
