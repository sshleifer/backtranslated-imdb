Here is another film that is not very helpful for many suggestions. It is a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining and which, of course, finally led a series of television successes that most said it was better (I enjoy all, personal). For others, it is difficult to accelerate Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were cured at a TV show by Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe the opposite). But what we have in these events is all four actors who in real life seemed very much like their filmmakers who were able to make these characteristics themselves. It is Neil Simon's equipment that is important, and where it laughs. <br /> For those who have somehow never heard of ODD COUPLE, it's a neurotic story and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage with his patient wife and takes shelter in Manhattan's friend's apartment his ignorant and innocent (Matthau). Setting these two possible apartments together in the four walls makes some of the most extraordinary demonstrations.
