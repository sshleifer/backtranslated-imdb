Just search. Looking for green feed in New York City, Jon Voight is a young cowboy Cowboy (near Gump-like) Joe Buck from Texas. It will not take long for Big Apple to compel him and all his expectations and soon Joe is the goal of all of New Yorkers's winter and losses from road booths. Because of his pure heart, he is sympathetic to one of these sticks, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later joins him into his apartment violence and two are struggling to survive. <br /> <br /> During the Midnight Comedy is called as a comedy, well described as a bad comedy or comedic disaster in my opinion. It is on all the beautiful films that are stylish in the hippie-modern vibe of the 1960s with its impressive movie of Warhol-party and juxtaposing with New York City. The film breaks Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in the middle, and thus stresses his outdoor position. We feel in his struggle to intervene, but also get only enough money to feed RZO Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as well as rich in substance and builds a lot of heart. I think this film should be encouraged to explore the forest and its pure heart and out-of-the-way, and in large quantities, the Mamba Dundee film as it is associated with almost all forms of humor - the difference between country- cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans. Very compelling and creative film which I recommend very much. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
