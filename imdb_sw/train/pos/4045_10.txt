I am very happy that I have a chance to see this small gem movie. I saw it in a private film festival, so don't expect to come to your city anytime soon. During the film, I saw about 10 people wake up and walk out. It's not bad for them (down in the south, people don't like to read the headings below). The movie will start slowly, but it is rich in discussion which I never felt tired. When that step comes to an end, I found myself on the screen as if I was climbing a basket of cells. <br /> <br /> I also had a great kick of the Titles that appeared before the chapter, especially those who set up characters as they appear on the screen. Reminds me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you face the heads of the level. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video / comic movie" movies, then I invite you.
