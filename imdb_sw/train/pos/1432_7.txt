I was also looking to see this film as a preview-like film for people who love movies about nature. The movie shows different situations and animals associated with them from North Pole and down south as the movie continues. Footage from this movie is often very pleasing and often wondered how on earth they could take some underwater shots or heaven. However beautiful, a large part of the picture I had already seen in the 'World Planet' of a series of television, referred to by David Attenborough. I saw Attenborough's description of the planet Earth better than the World notes. 'Earth' is a simple movie. It jumps over the scientific explanation which Attenborough covers in its series of 'Planet Earth.' For example, the Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is the best nursery for the small wild whale, because there are few small animals. The planet Earth will tell you that the tropical ocean is a good nursery, because water is less oxygen and is less nutrient to help so many animals, like big sharks, etc. So, it is an important difference. That, with the great voice of Attanborough's top makes the planet Earth better document than the Earth. Still, however, I think the world should look at the beautiful pictures and the fact that it is easy to understand makes them attractive to children as well.
