I watched this film with my baby's eyes, and I had no desire. The story is known, the orphan orphan must be brought to his parents with the impossible trio (tiger mamooth - sabertooth and lazy animal) ... This made me very laugh at the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: it works, it's amazing and it's “must-see” with your kids (they will like it).
