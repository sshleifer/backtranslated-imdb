This film agreed with me on two levels. As a child I was transferred from London to climb up the interest forces in the country. When I fled the bombs and I had experience that produced valuable memories (for example hearing around night singing in the dark for the first time) and enjoying the life I never could have in London, I missed my family and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and son are both dead and living alone in a small country country. As an old man who now does not have a wife whose children are married and live away in another province, I am also alone alone. The mother of the boy is a fanatic religion and very unusual ideas of raising the child. Since deep love has grown between Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom goes in his search and ultimately save him from a very unusual situation and is dangerous. At the end of the story there is a great tension since due to some bureaucratic rule appears that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a relationship of love with him.
