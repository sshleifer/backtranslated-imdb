This film has the basis of a decay of simple morals, and still a sense of justice. Many ordinary Joes among us would like to "catch the MAN". "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports in his office. Later, Paul retires 70 to Mr. Marchand the owner of the club. And then there is Paul's Parole Officer. There seems to be any question about this last characteristic character. The audience says that it is a weakness in the low-lying game of ping-pong among our two characters, increasing the problem until their lives have changed dramatically. They see each agent "MAN". One or both can be deleted, killed, or closed if they do not do as they are told. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sense of last aid. Carla finally gets put. His boss is forced out to be jerk. Mr. Owner of the Club is a mess of pulpy in his own bathroom. They earn $ $. And ... they are not worried about the information of the Parole Officer, because his moral weakness causes him to put his heavy wife in the apartment (or whatever the police was found to be arrested). It is a key trigger of the barrier to the lock of the lock that is seriously injured. Never worry that someone else can find Paul's file later to manage his release; for when they are free! They can even leave with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They serve someone!
