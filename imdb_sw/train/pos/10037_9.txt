Shipping can be dropped but the movie does not get !!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' made again with this amazing picture. One of my most popular events is the 'dinner table', where the family of Rose and friends meet Jack after rescuing him. Rose looks at her face that every woman should have when you meet with 'THE ONE' ... Jack and Rose have a relationship that is a 'MOVIE STUFF' but it is a good feature of the film. We have a lustful mother and all her scholars include partners who live far from their husbands' wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but Gilbert's Grape star saves him. I was very interested in hanging on the boat area. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long but it's amazing !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go see it twice if you want, It's worth it!
