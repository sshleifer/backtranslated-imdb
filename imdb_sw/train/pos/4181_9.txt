It has been a long time since I have seen this movie (at least 15 years) and still it attracts me to a clear picture of the negative consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the Geneva Conditions. The unit of underwater water experts in Australia is taken to the islands near Japan after a successful mission to set up mines in the Japanese port. Once they have jailed these people expect treatment similar to any other POWs but for their worries recently learned from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are tested as spies since they were out of uniform when captured. The results of the violation, and the Japanese military code, are used to be beaten. <br /> <br /> Despite their prayers, and the prayers of the prison guards of compassion, the day of counting the way as an interesting time bomb. The tension is too high you will actually hear, though it may be your chest with a blow and a cycle of action of the protest action. <br /> <br /> The end is also really painful to re-discuss my head here. But I can promise you - you never forget. Good luck to find the video in U.S.
