This movie is very strange, it is difficult to find words to describe. This is the only time I can decide which is the best, book or movie. Whoopi Goldberg is wonderful, and Oprah Winfrey, a very good actor, can be happy, happy and sad at the same time. All along the film was well guided by Steven Speilberg, and not approved. 9/10
