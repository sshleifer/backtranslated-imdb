I love this movie. Bozz is ultra-cool, not being a soldier who doesn't want to go to war. His Persona is the same through Yossarian in Catch-22, the Joseph Heller's novel of men and war. This film, however, is not set in the war zone, but in pre-war training training. This amazing film is about identifying the disease that Vietnam's war is an offense and those men who have been excluded as a sacrifice because of the loss. Colin Farrell is a brilliant like Bozz, a soldier who has shown a true love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he has forbidden and forgotten for the establishment that you tried to kill him. Bozz is quite cool and not done, measuring and strengthening its military chiefs, getting their goats every opportunity. He is an example of Jesus Christ and a degree of psychology, "save" his fellow soldiers and show those who need the truth, the way out of the army of man. <br /> <br /> Acting and action is crisp and reliable and like "sleeper", Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of three top Vietnam videos in my opinion. FIVE STARS, pick up on.
