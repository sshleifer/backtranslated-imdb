Perhaps Disney had the hope of another Pope Poppins but this is a very different story and when Angela enjoys he was a very different actor for Julie Andrews. After saying that Lansbury is fully cast and provides magical performance. There is something very interesting about his behavior and has been given extraordinary support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry tune but certainly does not know if the singer. It does not matter if he was a gifted actor. There are some great names from the most popular stars sometimes like Roddy McDowel who gives the winning performance and the most loved Tessie OShea who does very little but it's nice to see the old gal. It is also good to see Sam Jaffe and king of English TV Bruce Forsythe in small tasks. These findings are very good, especially the briny sea and I do not believe. The main Portabello Road is installed but has many displays. The effects look at a little cliche today but the German invaders are attacked by the wild army in the film is amazing. Children do not like the other movies but someone is trying to understand what a young person says. I loved the march of the home army. House guards were very important for the UK and this is a heat tax. Animation is beautiful, better than Pixar which I find too much. A fun and amazing film has not been done in action.
