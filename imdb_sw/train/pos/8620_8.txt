I have finished watching a version of 139 auctions (widescreen) and other friends and we were beaten. I won't bother to repeat what others have said. What filmmakers do and the concept is unexpected and fun. The greatest battle is bored. Later we were surprised to see that there are still about 30 minutes left to go but that did not prevent us from being fully involved and accepted. There is one thing that destroyed it and that was awesome music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads are not here and every time we all have broken into laughter. It's hideous. You have warned but stories and stories lay the foundation. There are several best moments that make you look at the talent behind the camera. There is much use of silence as well as photographing a slow motion that works well. I wish I could erase the music but sile. <br /> <br /> Delete this out. It's fun, it's different and takes you to a place you don't expect and that is so comforting.
