This film was interesting to take with Hollywood on the novel and the same name as Pearl S. Buck. While some people today may think it is an ethnic discrimination, while the Chinese idea was still going on itself. I found that white actors playing Chinese were not as bad as I expected, that is not the same as the blackface Asia. Back then he had no Asian participants in the United States (even George Takei was doing) and Rainer did a good job with his part. It was not the greatest performance I have ever seen but through the old school system that was working well. The locust area had been shot very well and had a special impressive effect. I wonder that during the release of the type of Great Depression comes back to this film as an example. Especially the political shock is destroying farmers and how they seem to be abandoned by all. The film had a parallel with John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence was also affected. If this was a western family, the locust would have won at the end, and punished the farmer for his pride, greed, and evil. However here he learns his lesson, then he succeeds.
