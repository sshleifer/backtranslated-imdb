The shot, artists show their particular role. You get a real impression of Lucienne climbing from poverty to the most beautiful girl. Feeling of the tragedy to fight the tragedy again. All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times. The commentary of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this film to anyone who loves beauty of art as well as a line of bad stories.
