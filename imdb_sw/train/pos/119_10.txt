The best way to describe Europa, which is on the list of my favorite films, is the excitement from a friend after the film ended: "I didn't know films can be made like that". Very appropriate in the visual style, is one of the best examples of what can be movies. It's far away from the "master and coverage" style of shot as one can get; fully integrate multiple layers of images, sounds, effects, props, conversations, sound up, performance, editing, lights, etc ... all the same, none more. Despite the Hollywood conversation of myopia, the movies are not about talk, not about good lighting, action or music. It works best when all of the same elements, where to specify the elements, by order or combination that are presented, will communicate with that idea. Reducing or eliminating the contribution of one element, and the film is useless. "Europa" is what the cinema should strive to be.
