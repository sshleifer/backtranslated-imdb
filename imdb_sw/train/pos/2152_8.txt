There was a good time in the reality of modern life (not just in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how sophisticated culture can be, and you want to lose out of mold created for you. Playing was just a car to say "do what you like even if it's the norm". Instead Billy Elliot if I would say. I enjoyed the film too. Humor was planned for a time, and when it was affected you saw it as true, you could feel the stability between Sugiyama and his wife, love in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and wig and his excitement on the dance floor made me just sing! <br /> <br /> All workers did a good job, the story was well written. I looked at it a second time and took a little nuances that I missed on the first look. Good entertainment!
