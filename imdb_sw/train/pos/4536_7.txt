It is written by the author who wrote the best series of the killing room that has written the ACD and Doctor's adventures, Joseph Bell, I was looking forward to this and I had no desire. It was very slow moving, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle's confusion in Sherlock Holmes which was very accurate and effective. It was a study of interesting behavior and beat well (on a digital, odd video with a piece of period). Acting was very good around, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox though an actor who showed ACD, whose name I can't remember was not interesting. The best study of the behavior on the same amount of decline as any ordinary Sherlock Holmes case. What? Watch this if you get a chance
