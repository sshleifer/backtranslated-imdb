With a simple story and hero to get involved, this was a terrible movie that started all. John Carpenter brings the life of a dream nail on Halloween night, while Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis at its beginning, the work of defining work) and his bad friends arrange a fun-only night to cross the path with the infinite psychopath from hell. Michael Myers has fled from the astronomical lies of ... as he killed his sister fifteen years ago, now he has come to Haddonfield, the city of Illinois which his murder took place. As soon as he visits Laurie after dropping out of the bag to the left house where he lives, he begins to talk and start to frighten him, turning on his fun night for fear as he incites anyone in his way to reach him. br> <br /> The beautiful display of lighting and lighting makes this flick of awesome horror ... scary ... for long long shots feel like you are faced with a guilty killer himself. Myers is well hidden until it is fully revealed in an exciting conclusion. Even though "Halloween" is temporary, it is not less than decline. The idea alone is a mixture of pipe, and this little shocker is one of the most popular and memorable movies of fear that have been made to this day ... has given seven sequels and finally remake of the terrible Zombie Zombie, and put a new state of fear which still remains it is today.
