Cillian Murphy and the star of Rachel McAdams in this written and directed by the master of doubts, Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie begins to trouble in The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. This problem is set by Lisa Reisert, hotel manager. Then he goes to the airport, and that's where all the trouble starts. He meets Jackson Rippner, who doesn't want to be Jack in the name of Jack Ripper, if you know you and I mean. Then they climb the plane, and enough, Rippner and Reisert sitting next to each other. For the next half, Lisa is scared, upset, scared by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we go on to where Jack drives Lisa off the airport. Then Lisa goes home to see if her father is right, and enough, Rippner is ready. There are about twelve minutes of violence and strong force in any area. In general, about 25 minutes of severe action comes at the end. It is not just a powerful film but it was a good plot. As I said, I will not give you anything because it's exciting and exciting and awesome / awesome. And acting from each character in the movie, even those who do not have the lines altogether, all were perfect pitch. It was wonderful. Everything was amazing in this film! Acting, music, effects, decisions, leading, editing, writing, everything was amazing! Wes Craven is obviously the Master of Suspense. The red eye is definitely a must-see and it is definitely to use the value of using your money. You can watch this film regularly and again and never will be boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is better than 10 stars out of 10. br>> My MPAA item: PG-13: Some Bad Violence Procedures, and My Language / Canada Rating: 14A: Violence, Horror Events, Horror Content
