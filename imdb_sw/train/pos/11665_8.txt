I would like to know about this film not "surprise" of Oscar selection for the best animation feature. Surprisingly, it happened that I was able to look at this animated treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about Brendan's child who was the abuser of a permanent and overprotective Abbot of Kells. The original task of Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, a famous Iona, ran with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes with an artistic model and an outline of the outside world. While on the way, Brendan was a friend of the white sprite Aisling forest, for he tried to restore the old glass of great value to the art of the typical book. <br /> <br /> "The Kells secret" is not the best for the animation provided today. It is a waste of species as illustrations are carried out in geometric lines and design regardless of originality, such as signals. The movement of these verses is a reminder of the simple style of animation that is used in the first "Kung Fu Panda" series. However, it is the biggest use of color which is the most important source for the audience. The fragments used in the Viking raid are uncontrolled anger. Try to get this film's stylish gem. It is an honor to welcome from any guns at current prices such as "Monsters vs. Aliens" and so on. Celtic music players are the best in avoiding the feeling of fantasy which imbues the film. Okay, the story can be a little bit and a little bit wanting. I would like to know more about the book that Brendan and Aiden were working. But the clear star of this film is a clear sketch of its stylish, it said it was the basis of the artwork in the real Kells book.
