The main problem I see with this film is its logo, which screams for every note, "This is a movie of the cheapest." There's nothing more to say here. Simplified measurements. The second problem, which I see as very strong and also involves the opening of a plot near the end of the film (one of the shots money, if you will be), is a discussion between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and someone of the sunflower (Richard Ziman), where Martha has been revealed as the leader of the trial. At all during this discussion, the observer knows very well that he has to listen to the film debate. In other words, the suspension of unbelief decreases here. The credibility of a reliable discussion between two people is provided for the delivery of the news of filmmakers who want to give the audience. The third problem was made by Adrienne Barbeau. When I honestly believe to be a good actor in his work, I see that this part can be very low. The main aspect of his work that is not seen as mesh is the scope that character goes through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family with a woman near Rambo in a message. This part of the script would be open to stretch for any actor, and one cannot put too much blame, therefore, on Barbeau. To the extent that he did his job efficiently, however, I would just like to call a very serious problem on the film in general. Finally, the film did a good job in the first half because it was enough, especially when its panic shines. I feel that the film would have benefited from this commitment to these flashes as a mechanism to prevent the excitement because enough in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / <br / piece? I would like to give you a C + firm for B-, depending on how much credit you would like to give to the creators to produce this film on a small budget. Even with two serious and two major problems, the film is directed to the solid Jungian side of the Nazi falsehood. I do not see problems with the development of a plot or cooperation; The discussion, as well as the discrimination shown above, is very clear in areas, especially the most important part between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the reason for the increase was good, if it was a bit of fizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also involved produced, gave good performance. All of them, this film has value to view - see with your favorite Nazi. :)
