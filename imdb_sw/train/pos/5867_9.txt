Jacknife is a jewel of 80 years. It is a film that breathes in an amazing way with a very interesting touch. In Jacknife all lovers of European and American movies can find things to involve. Screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the major exhibitions so far. He shows his hero of drunkenness to make us feel his broken heart in every line, every step. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the most executives of all time in one of the simple but realistic performances in his work. Jacknife is never available as it shows his vivid heroes of the typical Hollywood elements of the character. After the war there is no hero. Everyone is a failure, and this film is about the same simple. No one can fix its pieces after the war, such as the heroes of this film. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war builds. It's just a very good film.
