As strange as it may seem, Gojoe is the stage of the anime-and of Hong Kong-leading to samurai flick with pacifistic messages. This film title is displayed through the main character (a great job with Daisuke Ryu), benkei-turned-boddhist-monk Benkei. Benkei has vowed never to kill again, but still takes a sword to fight what he thinks is a demon attack ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a difficult film to measure. It is a picture of a visual and beautiful picture, but it uses a lot of tricks (ringing cameras and speed speeds, self-portrait, beat, digital effects etc.), so the end result is despair. That said, the beginning and end of the film is however elegant and powerful. If only Sogo Ishii director would be wise enough to use his pocket tricks. Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a video with anti-brutal message, Gojoe uses a lot of energy and time screens to show up the events of the war permanently. Also, how the violence is displayed is always the defense force; In fact, the blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the pictures of the film signals. Luckily, Ishii is wise enough to show a bad, horrible side of violence as well. However, it seems that Ishii does not know whether he is doing a traditional or allegory act of deep values. Audience cannot be sure of this, either, to the end of the film. Power (though stupid) end up what it saves Gojoe; it emphasizes clearly that this film is nothing more than just a fest.
