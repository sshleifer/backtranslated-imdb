This movie is ridiculous! That's what I like about this "Right to Right" section. It's easy to judge this movie because it's not with Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, Marilyn's original and Eddie. But look at the year and do math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had started their parts far away! This time it does for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who enjoyed her role as Lili, was pushing Big 6-0 (though she was still beautiful and still had a perfect "Lili"). It is a shame that Yvonne De Carlo was not given a great deal. However, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them very popular! During the 2 seasons that MUNSTERS was at the time, it was the Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made it a success. All others served the cast members, not to say they were not needed. They were! The television series could not be saved as long as you did without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (original "Eddie"), the choice was very simple. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice on Joan Marshall. Although this film is not available with the original TV series, it still takes a good step and is one of the special "TV" specialists that was hit by a boob tube during the early 1970s.
