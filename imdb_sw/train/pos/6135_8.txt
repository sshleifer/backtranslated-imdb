Bedknob & Broomsticks is one of the Disney stations. It was done with the monitoring of animations and actors and actors involved with drawings. (Such a concept was used in Maria Poppins when children and Maria are lost on the road to the road.) I have enjoyed this film with the eyes of the child because I have not seen years. Back, it was one of my favorite films. It was magical and mystical, and the last events (the first crisis and spiritual weapons to walk in battle) were my favorite. There was a lot of stop-animation used by the narrative (for example, people turn into rabbits), which can be dated slightly and silly now. (Also, I believe that the film begins slowly.) Through the eyes of the child, this is an enjoyable film and it is easy for children to put themselves in children's places in the film. It's a thinking film which sadly has forgotten today.
