This was one of the best displays made for TV. If you have secrets and preferences and deviation and turn around. Focus on the terms. I was lucky I saw this in the UK. They can have that bad place, I can't remember, but at least it was on a regular basis every week. My friend and I got on the trailer inside, and none of us is a big fan of American series usually. After the experiment, we knew this was special. We missed a few events, making you sad and mad for the week loses those who lol. <br /> <br /> Great, great acting. Gary Cole was quite brilliant, even better than her role as Custer. Lucas Black made an amazing performance for the child, and Paige Turco was the best since the Fifth Party. And Nick Searcy of course, as a long sheriff suffered sidekick. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some bits of confusion and amazement, which I would think would have explained later, and of course would have been in a later series. That made the end less powerful, and you can say they would kill it. What has it made us go? Why did they do so with one of the best performances? Shoot exec.
