Very good comedy on journalist trying to learn how to put his head on water after running out of thought. It can't say much about this film without giving a story. I can say that a little bit looked like you're looking at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Nice surprise a little bit - after all another surprise. It is well documented and beautiful for all.
