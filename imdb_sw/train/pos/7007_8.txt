From the first place you are given signs about what's going on here. It becomes more apparent and more like story lines. Acting is very good and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what would happen I was very surprised because. I'm still wondering why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "second thought", but the last sacrifice seemed to be contrary to his feelings and emotions. It was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused. Maybe that was a film. I loved the film and Wil Smith could win another film. This one knows how to entertain the audience!
