First of all, I loved the music of Bruce Broughton, very of the sound, and this alone has increased the charm of the film. The best feature of the movie was three animals, shown by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and late Don Ameche. Although Fox has funniest lines, Ameche plays childbirth (sound of reason), and Field adds that the character that seems to make Chance. Humans were not like engaging, and sometimes the film caused it, but that's my only complaint. This is one of the most beautiful films, with the most beautiful Canadian shots, I believe. Although the film itself is too long, there is no good time, and this benefits from sound work and well written script. All in all, the most interesting and perhaps supported film, with 9/10 from me.
