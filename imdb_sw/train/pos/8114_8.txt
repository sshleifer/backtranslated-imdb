As scientists did in a way that H.G. Wells had their confidence in the future, history would have never turned how it did in the coming things. They were almost 80 years ago that Wells wrote the Examples of the Future that this film is based on and no closer to the world describing than ever before, in various ways. Even though players known as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson, and Cedric Hardwicke are in cast, they are more caricatures than real characters. It's a great weakness and film, it's dedicated to the philosophy of Wells of science to solve all the problems and we are all ignorant of the past. The Massey characters, two generations of one family view a more optimistic view of hope. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptical person who feels a man struggling before. And Ralph Richardson is a war that arises from the destruction of another thirty-year war. By the way as atomic bombs have not been established, toxic gas was considered to be a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and victory cannot combine. Scientists as a group are also higher than the world of politics involved in such things. In the well-being of Wells' people they certainly fled the Hitler regime and Mussolini. Those people, however, to conquer themselves, surrendered themselves to the Partners and made atomic weapons that were modernized. If they did as Good would, a person like Albert Einstein could be a junta of scientists who would introduce a new command after World War II. Well they got badly on time and in development. It never seemed to have a computer view as atomic power. Computer writers are more likely to be our rulers in the new brave world than scientists at the moment. Still, things have been helped by William Cameron Menzies and the set out provided an interesting view in H.G's mind. Wells, certainly a respected professional of his time though he did not have the right to the chapter of Coming.
