Searching for Quo Vadis in a local video store, I've got this 1985 edition that appeared to be interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Very very kind of film Ken Russell -yirky, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different." Nero was not widely presented as a wicked body, but as a wacky king, who was not filled who could have a circus job. Perhaps he is wondering why on earth he was placed in the "leading" kingdom - it was not very happy, and what happiness he desired. Klause Maria Bandaur had a good time with this role and played for everything was worth. Yes, Nero tormented revenge Christians; one of the many who did that. When one of his people complained: "No one will understand us. We just protected ourselves." He got that right.
