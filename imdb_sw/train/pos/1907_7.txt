The Simple Rules are an extraordinary display but also have life lessons especially in particular the subject of progression after a loss which was a part of which Paul died which was the first part I watched on the show coming to ABC. Henatey's Cate (Katey Sagal), daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and son of Rory (Martin Spanjers) - looking for guidance and support after Paul (John Ritter) death, grandfather of family. Cate parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) are supportive. I am happy later in the second season of this show decided to put David Spade in this show since he finished with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all this and all of these are very good. This view reminds me of a lot of sitcoms of the classic family from the 80s and 90s that was on ABC.
