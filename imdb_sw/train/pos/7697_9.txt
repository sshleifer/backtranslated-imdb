This is another great movie I was fortunate to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). Returning to the end of the 80's I was a newcomer of that kind and just new about JC big, SH & YB. I didn't know what to expect when I paid my money for hard money to see this in the "third-party bill of classics" in Scala old. I don't need to worry, I remained breathless with this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and did not see this movie, do it right now!
