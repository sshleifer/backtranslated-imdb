The dentist was made when almost every profession was psychological. We had mad police officers, ambulance men, secret secrets and that was just for the beginning. Dentist came suprisingly delayed because going to normal teeth is a dream of everyone. <br /> <br /> The program has been hit. Doctor's clean clean doctor Doctor Feinstone lives a perfect life in his "white house", has a very good wife and a good chance to work as a dentist. The dark clouds are coming to their horizon in the form of a bad IRS (Earin Bole of Terminator), clean clean nose "cleaning" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to have gone through a dark filter. He goes to the trouble and begins to care for people with bad teeth. And you don't want to come on his way. <br /> <br /> Traders were professionals. Producer / director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish movies like Re-Animator and Beyond. He led the pastor to Re-Animator and his first movie movie was very good from John Carpenter's They Live. Film producer Pierre David is known from the movie as Scanners. Cast was good. Corbin Bernsen obeyed me. I knew him from LA Law and Premier, but I could have been a new dream as a dentist. He was very good in his role and was a kind of sad man. Linda Hoffman was wise and dumb as wife of Feinstones. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after seeing him and the neighboring women I knew my future career. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, from More) was good to see if cop over the case. Virginya Keehne was a innocent young man who is almost a second customer for Feinstone. Final warning: If you have been like me and you have trouble with a dentist then maybe you should stop this. But if you want to try than you should be prepared with dark humor and bad ballot.
