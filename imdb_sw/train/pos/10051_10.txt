Family problems are increasing in real life and that is the meaning of this film. Love can hold members together through events and experiments and this is what this film is about. One person, Daddy, has the maturity and courage to maintain a family during trouble. Children are growing, directly, in a difficult way, realizing that regardless of their age or parent, the parent still loves their children and is ready to give them a river when they fall. ALL WORKERS are shown their characters who performed the best performances. Yes, I cried in a way to know that I had the same experience as an adult and later as a parent. This is true for life is one that every adult, and parent, will do well to see, though others do not realize until they are also parents. You must see for those who care about their families.
