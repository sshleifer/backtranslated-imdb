Mark Frechette star as Mark, the left university. Mark is accused of killing soldiers at the university, and he runs all the way to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane into the local airport, and emerging himself. <br /> <br /> Once you fly on the desert, Mark mark car spots from the air. A young woman named Daria walks, and she sees Mark around the plane. Mark eliminates the bird several times, causing Daria to walk or get hit. When he arrives, he is involved with Daria, who has been concentrated on the Mark's highjinks. After participating in heart talks for hours, Mark and Daria get naked, making love sand. But with Mark avoid the rules, they realize that he needs to continue running. Therefore, a short attempt by Mark and Daria is very smooth, because it cannot develop a full romance. Zabriski Point was Eraserhead's early 70s. All these films have quality, vague, and hard meaning with characters. Frechette was like a tough man, as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette approached the bank in real life. While he was in prison, Mark died of an untimely death. He was killed with 150 lb weight, which fell on him when he was weighed. The best thing about this film was the royal movie, with special visual effects. The incredible, slow-motion impurities in the air after the explosion, were a genetic stroke. Although not like to break the film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated with early 70s counterculture. I recommend, for those who love pre-preventive films that show hostility, youth rebellion during the 70's.
