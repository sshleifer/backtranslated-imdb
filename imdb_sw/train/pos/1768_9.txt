I don't laugh this hard on the film for a long time. I had to go to an early investigation, and I was happy because I had died. I had tears in my eyes for laughter in many films. All the audience shared my laughter, and they were clapping and screaming in many movies. <br /> <br /> Kudos for Steve Carrell (who was already a fan of). It proves in this talented film very good for playing. She has a style I have never seen. And Catherine Keener is as good as always. Thank God God did not come from Will Ferrell (love him, but he saw him very much during this summer). There were parts of comedic genius in this film. Thanks to Carrell, and thanks for writing (also Carrell). The triggering and dater speed and "obvious problem" was quite common. I'll go to see 'Virgin of 40' when it will be opened. My advice: go see for a great laugh with an incredibly enjoyable movie on it.
