Unfortunately for myself - I fell on this show at the end of his life. I only got a few (almost three) sessions before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters, and the story - but many of the GREAT executives! I was a fan of Gender and City, so I noticed two characters I told (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), with Jay Hernandez (From Carlito: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I enjoy watching small actors to get their results, and they felt like this show would further their work. I hope this at least gets back to the DVD, and maybe WB will take for the second season sometimes? At the same time, I look at the ABC website from the beginning.
