A good film which only eight minutes shows a mixture of odd species: hidden, thriller, music. In short, we are allowed to tell you about the story: The girl comes in European coffee and then ... The softest from the mysterious secret to the logic of the story. At any time, no way to place Vigalondo has been able to rejoice with B / W through ideas and despite (due to budget) quite strictly. Because of the unity of space time the film is approaching the size of a short poem (almost haiku). Spain, the country of quick poetry in B / W (Bu note Bu√±uel earlier?) <br /> <br /> Must see to assure our faith in small movies abroad.
