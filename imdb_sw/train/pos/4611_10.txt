I was but a young man simple, looking for a good movie action, and then there was a light shining on the TV station I had never actually watched, a little station known as SBS. One night I saw in the TV guide that the movie Jackie Chan - 'Story Story' will be later. To be fifteen, and just after the 'Rumble in Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "WOW awesome" and sat his look, and always shouted "WOW awesome" as the movie has continued. Two weeks later, after SBS showed 'Police Story' trilogy, I knew I had found my new actress favorite <br /> <br. /> Jackie Chan has Ka Kui, Hong Kong soldiers who busts great medicine Lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's Secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is taken by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan has been sent to protect her. Things go bad - the worst reaaaal - when the case Chu is dismissed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the biggest action movies ever, and one among the favorite Jackie. Chan Movies. It is approaching power, and it ends with one of the series of wonderful acts planned. Everything in between is good. However, some funny parts may seem a little taller than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is still one of Jackie's best efforts. For movie action, the story is good, and Jackie is the best actor than this at work with a 'New New Police' field. This is not a 'miracle', but maybe that's a good thing. The Police Story is one of the best works of Jackie. I was playing Jackie Chan movies, and I must give a good start to any Jackie fans. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan's movies didn't come well - 10/10
