Atlantis: The lost dollar has some of the best animation, smooth and intelligent conversation of any Disney movie that I have seen. And I believed it in the first 15 minutes. I especially love Don Novello sound of work on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Still the entire film appears to move at a speed of double that fits - at least in the first act. Another feature of any Disney movie is a satisfying opponent - which Atlantis does not provide. He average for the best. Half way through the movie there is a huge move. It's just that. It's a great movie however. Everyone should look at it.
