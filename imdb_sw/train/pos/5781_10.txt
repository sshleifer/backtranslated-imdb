"Most of us at least live in two worlds, the real world where we are at the mercy of the environment and the world inside, conscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr .Gone begins into the world of "The Maxx" A fascinating world where fantasy and reality are included. Inspired by the comic books of Sam Kieth, "Maxx" is very faithful to the material that was revealed, not only in the story but also in the style of photographs, which are seen as comic pages, and give this surreal show and unique appearance. But also, the story is interesting and entertaining. At some point it may turn too strange, but when you have entered into it, it is difficult to eliminate it. Myths and characters are amazing developments. Music goes perfectly with the style of show and give them a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, as many beautiful animations, this was a short time. "Maxx" must see. It is one of my all-time favorites.
