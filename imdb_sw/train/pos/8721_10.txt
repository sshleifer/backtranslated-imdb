Disney (and amazing people in PIXAR of course) provides a beautiful, exciting story with the best of computer animation. I agree that the 'faces' of bugs were more static than 'Antz' and they had four feet (in 'Antz' six ...). But nature was very good and animation was breathing. But then this is a lesson: it was not a computer that made it a success: it was a man behind the machine, who added a nice twist, which I miss in 'Antz'. Some of the highlights were 'bloopers' at the end (So keep the last look, it has its value!), Which was exciting and original. The line 'was completely addressed in the area' was planned for the viewer.
