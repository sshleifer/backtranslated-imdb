I'm afraid it was a movie that you need to look at completely to get anything from it. Not a movie that is not as sensible as ..... "GIVING WORK SECTION 58" you know one where Riggs are mad? not a film that is very similar at the end if it's beginning. you can run everywhere talk on the phone what to do and enjoy in any way. to understand it or what happened. Do not let your DOGGY GET THE EXAMPLE!
