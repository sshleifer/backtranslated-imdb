I watched the first 17 sessions and this series is just amazing! I was not impressed with the series of anime since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series actually depends on the h game, which I do not know if it has been done before or not, I have never played a game, but from what I have followed well. <br /> <br /> I offer this 10/10 series. It has great stories, interesting characters, and some of the best animations that I have seen. It also has a good Japanese music in it too! If you haven't seen this series yet, see. You can find the lowest intervals on anime websites out there, it's okay from Japan.
