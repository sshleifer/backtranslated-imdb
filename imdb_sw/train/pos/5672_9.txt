In this phase of the series, Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency period in the UK (during the future part of George III's reign). At this time, Blackadder's expectations are very poor - instead of royalty, he is a servant of George IV much (the price of the price). Unlike the historical accounts of George IV, this is about as bright as tomatoes and as a result, Blackadder can use him and arrange his heart plans. The only difference in the style between this one and the original is that the series has been completed with a very note, very, very different - you see only believe. More than that, all elements of the common story are there and the show is hilarious. The only storage I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children due to its bad language and adult situations.
