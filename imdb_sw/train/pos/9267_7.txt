Not a bad film. Somehow I was made to the true root for the conquerors to win the game played in the movie although I don't know anything about football and not a fan. The end of the bus was excited. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed into sports games among men because their oaths are not suitable for women to hear. Despite this law, some women are trying to get in, but most of them get arrested. It is really amazing that any society could have such an ancient gender concept. In an interview, Panahi says his films are the history of his history and injustice, and that one day we can look at these movies and see how Iran lived once. One hopes that the future will come sooner rather than later.
