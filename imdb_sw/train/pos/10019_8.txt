When it comes to movies, I can be very good, and I will complain about anything and everything done wrong. When every movie has its destruction, the Night listener had a low calculation. If you are reading the last review (it was difficult, since half of it was written on the hat and there was no real information about the movie), you might have been led to believe that this film was not well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 verses in the same review, you have found the reason for the rejection: he does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team is looking for ... appears) <br /> <br /> so, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie is eligible for its characteristics, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let's go on a quick list first: 1. good plot? Absolutely. I will not give you away, but the plot is compelling and certainly not what one expects from advertising. This is exciting, not fear, and should be given as such. This story will surprise them, even more so because it is true (and the plot continued to stay completely with real events). <br /> <br /> 2. Do Normal? Yes. Robin Williams long ago broke out of the comedy-cast chains, and since then he has succeeded in the great responsibilities that most people could have written down over the last decade. He sometimes gets the highest form in his role in the Night listener, playing the radio army who is constantly having trouble and getting into the case of ... well, I'll let you see yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Best trends? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I mentioned, I really know something about leadership. I have been sutdying the art of school leadership now for 3 years. I certainly don't think it makes a lot of difference (the only thing that is involved is if you would like the direction), but I thought it should just set up again that I put my thoughts here on something big and relevant. .. for example: it is not the sexual orientation of the director (or drug behavior of the production team, LOL). Patrick Stettner's direction was a lot of dark and dark, and allowed the horn and lighting to help create such "tension and release" instead of the fast, steady cameras and quick cuts we are constantly under today . Some people can show you stories through their camera, while others feel like they should make stories with the camera. I am very grateful when someone today has the courage to use the camera as required to be used, which is like an eye ball that we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, movies, and editing? Great around. I have prepared so much, and I could go over the last three for the other ten verses, so I'll just close. <br /> <br /> Briefly, go see this film. Do not listen to people who are interested in attacking, especially if they are so ignorant that they do not know that the goal of 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben
