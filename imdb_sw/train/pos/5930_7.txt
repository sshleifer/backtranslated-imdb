The mother-son-duo of pride (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) exploits the power of widows, and their new goal is good but Tanya alone (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of worries, overable more bestsellerists like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Mr Dung himself, is really not almost as bad as it could be. Yes, sometimes it gets dirty dirt, but there are some amazing touch surprises: good old cemetery, sound displays and candlelit-gothic-scene-scene, mirror highlighting the form of madness, etc.. The film is attributed to Mr. Dung's Mouthed dialogue and the seat of the seat-toilet seat of the fatty people, led by a senior shepherd, but there is a flow of fertilizer.
