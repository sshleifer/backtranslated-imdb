I see this film as a hub, but it has taken at least 4 or 5 times to see it, to identify what a great film. First, it describes WW2's face that we can't see in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German army, the army and the Nazi government are shown more "humanized". One of the most fascinating truths is mentioned, at the end of the film, of the genocide that occurred in the forest in the last 20 years ... that the forest is the place where the final stages of Berlin Alexanderplatz are being held: That are the trees where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another tip for those who like notes, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is considering the change of people every time they go to the door, or the door is open. Many doors are shown on the screen, opened and locked. And the characters change in their personality, their actions, etc. at any time. What? Did you see that?
