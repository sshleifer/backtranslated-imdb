Michael Stearns plays Mike, a distressed sexual man with a view of sexuality. It has no problem as naked but while women start having sex with men when they lose. He believes that when women are having sex while they lose any sense of "guilt" and / or "beauty". So he travels through Hollywood Hills to beat a loving couple away, finally shooting dead people with high-quality guns. <br /> <br /> The primary reason for the existence of this film is to engage in regular sexual activity. "Stories" comes as more after. This should make many of the happiest men of both sexes when we are very interested if we are treated with long-term fraud (women here look at unhealthy clothes) and sex used as a great measure of consideration. Of course, you see a fair deal through the maximum ups a strange reason and shows you forced towards voyeurism. (For one thing, Mike checks the couple through the scope of the moment at one time before they finally pull the trigger.) This is all carefully attested if the atmosphere of the atmosphere in sound sounds. <br /> <br /> penetration of lurid trash should enjoy this for one degree or another. Even with a single lesbian experiment with Mike and makes him less sure * how to respond. It opens very fast, but it is experiencing an exciting surprise. It is a shortage of kinky and lost that if nothing else is going to keep other viewers on the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
