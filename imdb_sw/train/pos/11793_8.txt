I look forward to going back as soon as possible. I'm trying to check all Star Trek items. This is the 3rd month and I have now been on the 3rd Season of TNG and I am ready for DS9 for the full. Star Trek is a great television event. <br /> <br /> "Gray Shades" is the first part of the record in the TNG series. After just watching these exhibitions, these parts were clean in my mind, but I noticed how some of them were beaten again because the film looked better. The 1st season was always seen as real and bad for me - and the executives seemed to be stupid, if they did not benefit in their skin. <br /> <br /> The show is basically just made on the great hits of more fun and sad times in the life of Riker on Business until this moment. Statistics and Riker area in the hall-hall is a common time of new friendship. My thing is when a 2 officer on the Klingon ship defeats Riker's power as the first officer and the Riker hitting CRAP alive from Klingon. Then the administrator goes to $$ but good. All this time is a reminder that the LOT of things, things have happened already in just 2 seasons and 5 more to go with a few movies! At this point in the series they begin to develop feelings that bind Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Up to now they have been told the truth, but they have not yet used it. Let the record show that ST Week - Memories Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and suggests that he has had a close relationship with Riker and also keeps very close to emotion. This period proves that there will be romantic interests for a long time. <br /> <br /> Here are the features: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this point in the series, the value of production is faster and Star Trek TNG puts into a sci-fi behemoth which it was appropriate to be. Look at this as an adult I see now what THE BEGINNING OF THE STRIKE OF THE Star Trek provides. They need to make a new show of ST set after all present presentations. Movie DS9 would also be good.
