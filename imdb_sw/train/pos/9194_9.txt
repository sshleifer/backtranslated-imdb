I first met with this show when I had lived in Japan for six months last year. I got it on the internet when I was looking for good tips to help me with my Japanese. The host mother warned me to get away from it because she thought it was weird, but I found it fun! Koyuki demonstrated the characteristic of the spirit of Matsujun made my day every time I get! I first saw him in "Hana Yori Dango", but I loved him more in this! Even though the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to see that it did not change very much in the show. Their relationship grew, but they were not true. Still, the fun time had all (Even for Fukushima!).
