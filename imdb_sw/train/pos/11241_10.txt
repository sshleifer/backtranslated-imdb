I got this, one of my all-time films on a DVD recently and as usual, while watching, anything hit me. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Hazel O'Connor and the sound of this film has just me in tears, especially "Are You" will follow. It is a journey of cleanliness to me for my youth. These two standards are better for Quadrophenia (which was also starring Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> Sound of a loud voice with a great view of Britain in Thecherite years of 80 pain I grew up. The latter is sad, for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering child. I hope to turn off this DVD from a regular view, I can watch it regularly and never be bored, just by the voice alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear about your father's sister. God bless you all. xx
