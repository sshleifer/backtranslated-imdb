OK. There are people who should not see this film. Do not see if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) Do not like if you are unsuitable by _The Watchmen_. 3) Do not see if you want a great movie of superhero. Some of you, sing, don't go, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's quirky, it's a delightful sendup of every bad cliche known to man. Frequent playback in youth humor is not of the tongue-of-the-side of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria, as well as sub-sections with Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see Louise Lasser get to work, too.) I laughed all the way. It is absolutely worthy, somewhat extraordinary, but a godi-.
