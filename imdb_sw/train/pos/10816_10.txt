No, this should not be a great transparency of the budget, but it is brilliant for its own right. you have to look at what it is, a low-budget budget involving a woman's zombie with a 12-inch stick of love that puts out the beat. those who came to give this movie a low review were perhaps looking for a second group of worship or secret "secret" as they say and did not get there. I like how everyone shows a clear observation such as "5 out of the holes of fish" hahaha, well, yes. I don't think the movie and the budget like this can afford the "executives" or effects so that they can work with what they have. The guts and entrails were really very convincing. The movie was a little choppy from the sequence to the sequence but in general, this is one of the best movies I have seen recently that it is not recommended any trend or prediction. very good to laugh.
