Paul was completely crushed by a man who made Dave. It's the same story, not as funny. Paul told me this morning about the event sammy davis sings a new national song of the parador. arrived in Brazil after a long flight from vegas, three airplanes, a car ride to a set, etc. was beaten. he couldn't stand, he had to use cane. he was sitting in a trailer about the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> didn't know he could do it. then he saw an extra 6000 crowd, paid bucha 7. he lived and photographed it for two hours. he was so great, then he fell around. Paul is a good boy, though he likes it very much. real talent.
