Most educational movies are not more complicated than the intellectual, preserved only by the fact that "MST3K" laughs ("Why the Industrial Arts Research?" Coming to mind). "Great Hemo" is actually quite done. It is all about blood, heart, and circulation system. I agree that I don't remember everything from them, but it does a good job to describe everything, making it big but fun. I think that you can always count on June Foray (the most popular voice of Rocky Squirrel, he has a pig here). That "Hemo Magnificent" itself can be hard to find, maybe the best place to see it in "Gremlins": The class is watching when the gremlin makes it.
