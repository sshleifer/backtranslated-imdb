This is a good film for fans of McCartney and Beatles! The royal time is guaranteed to all. Listeners (and some celebrities such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) are, as always, very strange: from young children to the sixty-year-old inspectors. They know the words for all songs by heart, and some of them cry when Paul enters the "black" "yesterday" "all my love" and all the treasures of his list (who except John Lennon and Dylan, can claim such a repertoire?) very much moving: <br /> <br /> -Two double for Lennon and Harrison, the first "here today" they did solo (the head was included in "tug of war" 1982 and it was his best track), then "something" while Paul uses ukulele. "The long and windy way", when necessary, when Paul's voice dies, for he moves to tears with the members of the tourist's servants holding the stage. I remember, in the first seventy years, when people defended Paul, because he had no involvement in politics, as his former partner was. They had to change their mind to Paul as a volunteer artist: "popularity is a great reason that allows love." The film shows various aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is nothing but selfishness.
