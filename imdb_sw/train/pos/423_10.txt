I have read the summary of the plot and is the worst I have read. It doesn't work right for this amazing movie. For example a good summary, read the list in the "Turner Classic Movies". Otherwise, this was one of my favorite movies like a little child. My sister and I could not wait until April every time we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horses at the time. It is one of the great scholars who the whole family can look for. Color is clean and beautiful. The story line is interesting and the songs are good. They don't have movies like this again. Good acting and not on top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are your best, with many other actors.
