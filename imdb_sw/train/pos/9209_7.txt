RATING STAR: ***** Function **** Just Misses Mark *** That Little Little Among ** Lagging Back * The Pits Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) peace make his way in the West Wild when he batches men's gang woman. Being gentle, usually comes in and stops this and by doing so he kills the son of a bad striker. This is the beginning of all the guns that fight until the end will be only one winner. M Dudikoff is a star of action that has never been able to overcome me. Maybe I found him too late and after another film I saw him on Monday, the Human Shield, was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have something to the west, that movies that are a kind of transport to me at a different time and place and give real entertainment to the fighters and this Dudikoff has taken one of his best literature, if his films go anyway. <br /> The film blows a few points under the frame of the middle villain, releasing the sound as empty Marlon Brando and some ropey takes from some cast, with an unnecessary array of looking cheap. But if, for a strange reason, your life is dependent on the Dudikoff film, this will be one of your best choices. ***
