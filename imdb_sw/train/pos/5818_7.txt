Actually this movie has a romantic time, part of the clay and Joe Pesci and part of the children, and is worse than other MJ movies like "Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Spirit". But if the trouble of dying Michael Jackson fan since eleven years, (Yes, that's half my life, you people!), I can't complain very much about it. Just see this good man and hear his wonderful music is a Heavenly journey for me. But as a movie, it's not quite good, and I'm afraid, that it will get a very low grade to me, if my boyfriend Mike didn't have one star in it. But since no one except Mike is the author of the month, he needs to get 7 out of 10 from me.
