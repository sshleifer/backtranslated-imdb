Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film with 18 categories. You can make groups - 18 in 120 minutes because each director had seven minutes to tell him or her story. The movie depends on the basis that you can, in fact, tell the story for a short amount of time. Columns work. Almost all groups are powerful, complete, and satisfying. Each offers a different feature of Parisia's experience, and almost every director provides the best performances from good and very close people. There were many powerful pictures in this film that are hard to select one or two favorites. I probably remember I was Juliette Binoche as a sad mother in the "Place des Victoires," Gena Rowlands as a beauty of aging in "Quartier Latin," Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in part "Loin du 16ème" and Margo Martindale as a letter car Colorado's mail learned to speak French so that he could visit Paris (part of "14ème Arrondissement"). A special visit must be given to Gulliver Hecq, perhaps a very young boy who is attacking a US tourist at the Paris Metro Center (part of "Tuileries"). <br /> <br /> This is the best movie. My wife and I decided to hire for a few months so that we could get some of the tricks that we don't miss. However, Paris is very beautiful and I can recommend that you try to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss!
