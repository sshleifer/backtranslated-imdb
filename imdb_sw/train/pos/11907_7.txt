Hitchcock had a view that the listeners are not interested in what puts the characters at risk - just that they are dangerous, and they need to escape. <br /> <br /> This film confirms Hitchcock was not accurate for 100%. Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when he is not clear. Trevor Howard decides their best course of action is run for it. And so, the body of the movie has a pair of shades of walking and leaving trains, buses and coaches - jumping over rocks on the waterfall - penetrating into the bridge. Everything is exciting - but I couldn't get out of my mind that it was not necessary. They should be sitting set. In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
