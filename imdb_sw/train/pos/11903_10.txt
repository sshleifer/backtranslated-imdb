I was lucky to get this movie when it is dedicated to the Maryland film festival. I have been a fan of the most fearful films and especially the William Castle, so this was definitely necessary to see me. This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was the lowest director. Actually, he made awesome films of cheap budget, but he added something to these films: the real living things of the hall that you will never see again. For example, she had nurses if someone had a heart attack in her movies and put vibrators in chairs in the TINGLER. This is a true document made well and brings this striped director into the light, and celebrates its contributions to awesome movies. It also shows Castle as bigger than the character of life, who was very interested and had a smile to her face. Unlike most films that show more waram from film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mainly from its members and directors who were affected by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis, and Joe Dante. You must see for tribal fears and sci-fi fans.
