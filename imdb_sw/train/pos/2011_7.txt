If you have never watched this film and as former actors, this is a film for you. Look at Frank Sinatra when she was very young and very thin with cheeks and a strange voice that sang many old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave the best performance with a large number of drums and music numbers. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake) played a major role with Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who made a classical piano with no comedy stick as he did in his career. This is not a good music, but Frank Sinatra was thrilled to see at the beginning of her career in the 1940s.
