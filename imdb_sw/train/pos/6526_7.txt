I have always enjoyed watching this time when you came to the television during an additional year in 60 years. It is a typical Hollywood story, which is made of drawings, modified and full of guilt but so what is, it's a movie of entertainment and a good film. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the producer of this remake of his 1938 film. The actress Anthony Quinn who had the role of Beluche in the '38 film is the director at the beginning of the text and the swan song if he has never had a film before and never. DeMille gathered workers who had recently worked on his 10 orders to help Quinn pull away including DeMille's long-term partner / actor Henry Wilcoxon who oversees the project. Also from the Ten Commandments is an image writer Jesse Lasky, a movie star Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director of the second unit Arthur Rosson, artists Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, appointed Sam Comer directors and Ray Moyer, The creators of the clothes Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who are the design team of the clothing has received only the Buccaneer selection of Oscar. Good here from the DeMille team led by Yul Brynner as a pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President Michael Jackson. Also in the cast is Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. For more than two hours it pulls to other places but it makes for better battle stations. I would like to give 7.5 out of 10.
