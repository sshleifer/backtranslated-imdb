This amazing wonderful amazing game pays good taxes to stay true to the community. In all the wonderful games of superhero that has been highly lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also shows the sound of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman. When you expect to expect Spiderman does anything the spider can. He makes more than spin webs. In fact, they use as weapons and shields. While it does not use the network to fight, it claps and catches too. Fikila has its full hands as he fought Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr Octopus for a few. See Captain America in comeo. Most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it is very short and can be completed for less than three hours. If you're a fantastic fan of superhero, this game is for you but you don't expect long gameplay. Good luck in "Spiderman 2." My evaluation: 9 out of 10.
