Kubrick showed his beauty again, now in an amazing-frightening film derived from the book of Stephen King so called the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in forty years, married, with one child, and for a period of trouble and drunkenness. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado has stopped service during the winter because of extreme weather conditions, and there is a well-paid job for the caregiver during five months; and Torrance, who was looking for an author, saw it as perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness of this place in winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that a former caregiver had made spirituality and killed his family. Even before he arrived there, his son Danny, who has a friend of thinking who facilitates the future (shinning), knew where it was not good and didn't want to go. Once you set yourself in the hotel, things started well but within a month, Jack began to do something extraordinary, angry, and rising. At this point, we know something will happen, but they don't know when and how. The horrible things that happen like the appearance of two twin girls talk to Danny, and the man who attacked violently. They're alone here. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good with them, as if they were his family; among them a famous psychologist, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "characters" at the hotel. Obeying this command, Jack went to the goal with many terrible things that I have ever seen happen here. The end is amazing and the audience will continue to be interested and shocked until the last minute.
