This movie is a great mocumentary. It follows a rap, NWH, comprised of Ice Cold, Taste and Tone Def for a special way to gangster rap highs, lows and back up. Through trouble with women, egos, cops and white, this group gets on the gangster rap world, as this film goes on the attack. I know every highly recommended group is This is a Wind Wind, for very good reasons, however I think that if it is a proper feeling, this movie is better. Laughter did not end, even for someone who did not enter the rap culture. I am a white, not interested in rap music, culture or anything else related to it, however I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the screenplay, songs and stars in it showed great potential and it is a shame that I have not seen since the Fear of Black Hat. However, I have seen him once more than you, and that is, that I recommend the Fear of Black Hat for you to quickly laugh. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Don't shoot with you to see whites! .... their eyes? No, not a shot for you to see whites." .
