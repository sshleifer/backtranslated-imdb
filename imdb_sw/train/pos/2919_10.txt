I saw the film twice in a week's place, twice in the movie in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was filled with two and people had to turn. From the beginning of the film by Henry Winkler to get 'injured' on the football field all listeners were in excitement with laughter, laughter that lasted up to credit. For those who love America to fight this film is necessary, but be ready to see Henry Winkler if you have never seen him before. Also check out a well-known actor whose trademark fight with the head-but! When you have the opportunity to watch this movie and it is a family comedy entertainment for the best!
