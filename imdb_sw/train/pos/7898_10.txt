The movie found bad reviews but because it was contrary to because the critics could not "get" off the films, I thought I would try. Unfortunately they were indeed in this situation. The video feels also that it is too far to set. A kind of feeling that is impossible to describe, but it's not good. To develop more things, the script is a trivial matter that is very useful. A very talented talenter emerges through this mess making very difficult. Hurt and Bracco will try free to add something to the film and the performance of enthusiasm but nothing in the script. It may not have been embarrassing to them if they were chosen only by Thurman. One thing "critics" critics of the film could not mention however it is that the film is really quite funny. When it is time for a proper satire or other arrogant times such as when the grandmothers live in the issue dismissing Hurt away and ranch them with the smell of the waterless ... ahem ... in front of the bottle. <br /> <br /> Because of the chortles beaten around, when I do not recommend this film, there is entertainment to watch Even Cowgirls Get Blues is worth for something different.
