Rain or shine out, you enter the movie house. It makes you happy. (If not, come out.) Lights leave. You live down with a bar of ice cream. Moving photos begin to take photos on screen. You feel content. In the dark, you return to the beginning of time. Staying around the camp fire ... watching the modern version of the fire that circles 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering unknown turns and events of the situation with others of your family / audience. Those who are unhappy with themselves, should not write comments. (Long-term romantic music ...)
