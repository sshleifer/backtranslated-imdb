First of all, I need to start these comments by saying I am a great nightmare on fan of Elm Street. I think it's a great series of fear ever. For me, Freddy is hosted! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who tried to be the last shape behind, is a wonderful movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as previous films. Freddy has a lot of time screens. Others think it makes it low, which I agree. And that's, in my opinion, especially sure. This movie is available so we can know Freddy better, who he is, who, how he was a person who loves our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's best if we never know it because it's hard to know why evil is bad. Obviously these people won't like Rob Zombie's remake. To enjoy this truth, you should see different things. It's not about a wonderful man to hide in the bush of your dreamland waiting to fear your hell. This was the first, and it was amazing. As years passed, Freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could run away from him. Now it is time to learn about this state of evil, the psychological elements of Freddy's area of ​​fear. In addition to the old Freddy story, I also liked the status of the movie. No more children in Springwood, just grown adults. All bad events are serious. The sound is awesome, especially the opening song called 'I'm Awake Now' 'conducted by Doo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, the Last Nightmare is an epicenter and I can't believe it so it's hit down. Maybe it is unclear, or I have a different taste! Otherwise, all Freddy's fans should look at it. It has a lot of horrible moments as well as a pleasant time too, and a lot of cameos! Prepare yourself for something different and may not be desperate.
