A great movie of doubt and a strict campaign of campaign campaign adds the player makes it treat it to watch and enjoy. The director of director Brian de Palma who makes a huge contribution to consuming (many call it "rapoff") and this film and 2.35 DVD: 1 of a large mirror must fully appreciate the function of the camera (and several events and people hide each other on the side of the lost on the region designated for television). The failure of the movie, at least for anyone who has a certain kind of ethics, is the longest of all the characters, including police played by NYPD before Dennis Franz (who has hair here!) . The opening part is still shocking with the long swimming area of ​​Angie Dickinson which is quite clear, even 25 years after its release. Film has several instances of beauty in it as well as Dickinson (if it's really close) and Nancy Allen have no shame on showing their bodies. There is no much conversation in the first 20 minutes and there is no bad language to Franz entering the photo after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and although it seems who is the killer, it is still a good shock and happy to enjoy all the way, especially for men who live in naked women.
