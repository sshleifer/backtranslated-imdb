Before Nicholas Cage was a great star, he was a good actress. This most popular film is where Cage offers one of its best displays. "Red Rock West" was a low budget, very unknown film, but it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I found a walk under the shop shop, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who is also the greatest in the film) seen together. Go get this, and I'm sure you can't despair.
