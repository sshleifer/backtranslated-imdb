This is one of the most unfortunate films that found the most sad, unfortunate death on the box office. I saw this film in a local art gallery, in the form of a revival, shortly after entering the usual movies. It certainly deserves the second (or even third). Sandra B. takes the limit by making the words used and taking other songs known in this section (Hank's William's 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' might be a stimulus to tears). Maybe one day, the audience will be ready to take this film more seriously (but without good laughing, too). The film goes faster (thanks to good editing), so that other viewers don't find it and reinforce it. Maybe the revival is just below the tap.
