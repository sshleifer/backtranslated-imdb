This great movie has all the things that made the West of Spaghetti a lively and exciting: MUSIC MUSIC (with one of the few ... if not just .... the workforce working in that type, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING The point (and those who are greedy for the day!), with a beautiful setting and setting (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very beautiful story and a beautiful edge of its romance. Employees do a good job - with a realistic show of Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most important role for a woman in Western Spaghetti. Beside Cardinale in Leone "Once Western Time"). Without submitting any trophies, I would just say that this film has one of the last films I saw!
