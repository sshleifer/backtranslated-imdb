The love of the film, which is also its main theme, is beautiful and well displayed. However, the surrounding story of love is very lyric, graphical and unrealistic. Even worse, the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible, especially as the end of the movie. Don't hesitate to watch this film, if it has attracted your interest, but don't expect too much of it.
