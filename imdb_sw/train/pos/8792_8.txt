The kung fu film of entertainment, and act, conspiracy and combat the cutting off on the average football level. All of the cast are delightful characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan anedy comedy is a fun look, and his best friend shows a particularly interesting skill. For me, film films are the size of cast - sometimes, things are confused as wind films and changes between different settings, and some of the characters are not fully performed as one can. The kung fu film should be first judged on the quality of action, and the Shaolin Temple gives a clear impression on that calculation. The film faces a high-level battle that allows each character to display its knowledge against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Shaolin Temple is a luxury under the budget of kung fu movie. It is not about the quality of the beautiful video of Jet Li, but it certainly has a look for the fans of that kind. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Non-standard description: 1987's Warner Home video released by video was (predictably) unknown, and did not have full features of throw & staff.
