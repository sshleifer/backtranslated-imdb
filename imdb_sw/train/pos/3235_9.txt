The best modern, real pictures of modern Finland, touch and interesting. One of the best Finnish films made. It takes a wonderful life every day in Finland's small Finland town, the people's desires and weaknesses, joy and sadness. Solar eclipses create a cool climate for this effective human investigation. Lampela is one of many Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make incoming movies without gun and burst of blood. His second film Eila is also worth seeing though the story of cleaning women to fight their work is not as much as it looks like in the Jok.
