so yes it is quite nostalgic looking part 1 because this is one part i definitely remembered. I enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the presentations we have now this show seems to be bad. but in fact I like part of the "violence" of the show and the story line has more substances than new now. I thought it was interesting that the Airwolf of Belisario and JAG have the same theme - the leading actor (Hawke and Harm) are all seeking MIA's relatives (brother, father). as wonderful as the personal life of Robert Belisario imitates this plant. <br /> <br /> Question - does anyone have pictures of the Hawke cabin? I love the cabin (it looks like my dream cabin) and that's one of the events I remember about Airwolf.
