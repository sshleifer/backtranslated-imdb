This, "Son of Rebellion" and "Eastern Condors" are my films that love Sammo Hung. The Oil Dragon is more fuel than this ring than "in Condors", but he is not less sure as a director or actress. He, in fact, is on his form and provides a fierce, brutal executive who includes a fantastic semi-series and can tell a story of mercy, sweetness as well. Love and romance are not the priorities of the director here, but serve as a wonderful tool of action, and make sure that viewers do not beat the pace of movement between physical conflicts. <br /> <br /> The opening section, which has an extraordinary effort of the saber epidemic, puts a strong but deceptive tone. The sequence of Sammo's pedicab is driven by a car made by the sound, the comic. The fast and angry fights between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is an example of an amazing choreography and a bright, beautiful, and easy optimal style of its kind. The violence of the film increases gradually until, finally, when a sharp destruction comes, we are faced with the worst changes that have been seen in Sammo production. The case of Billy Chow's director / actor and a crowded house of angry, anti-shock is bone of the bone, physically punishing. Scary for each level and one of the best karate movies made. <br /> <br /> Good score, too.
