A wonderful and compelling movie. It is about a man who is very excited and heavy who tries his life's journey as a donor / door-to-door. The director was able to capture a strong voice that had ever made a good story. The original and separating time also gets great humor in life-related pain. There is a sequence in the testing center that has stopped and made me laugh in a voice that is not something I do as often as I have. One of the most unpopular films I have seen for a long time. It did not leave my mind and I expect Bronstein's future efforts. Wonderful performances around. Simple line "I am very happy." now it's iconic to me.
