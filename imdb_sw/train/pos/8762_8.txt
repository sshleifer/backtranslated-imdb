"What would you do?" is a question that will arise in your mind for a week after looking at Brokedown's attraction. You will also be left wondering if Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a matter that has been left unresolved, and thus. This is a very good and very good film. Although it is slow at times, its speed is to reflect the line of the story - but many films are made with the edge of your seat; want to know what happens next. In the end it will also let you see yourself in the shoes of the leading actors, who are played by brilliant Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also recommended.
