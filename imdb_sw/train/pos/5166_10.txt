Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic to me. I found it exciting, of heart, and love it altogether! Anyone who has gone to a camp like a child and wants to sometimes go back to a “good days” for a short time needs to see this! It starts like 20 years later, the old group of campers returns to the "reunion". I will not comment on the plot again because you see yourself. The executives were the best, and all the stars were beaten. Everyone played a great role. In fact you felt like you were part of a movie watching. Alan Arkin was very good in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy that everyone wants to have in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would recommend this to anyone with a heart! Recommended!
