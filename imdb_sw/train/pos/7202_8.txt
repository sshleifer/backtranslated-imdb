Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years before), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two people blowing a kiss on the screen, and in fact, I was shocked. I understood it on behalf of the plot, and it did not break my heart (not too much), but it was the first time I saw it, at least, in the "normal" movie. I thought it was a good step for his time, and it became bold to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as PG-rated Superman. Male discrimination on the screen may be a conflict of "Brokeback," but it is interesting to remember this original body.
