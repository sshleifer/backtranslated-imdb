Ah, Domino is a breath of fresh air, something new to the movie world. I enjoyed the film because of the complex plot, different characters, and the sharp effects of the camera. I found some complaints about the work of the camera and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, the flashy and wild shots were the end of mistakes made in time. All you see is the desired effect. Perhaps some are complaining because something like this has never been done before, although it is so. In the deepest detail, what you see is how Domino sees things through his eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to stories, I don't see anything bad about it. With the "aggressive" state, according to some, it is really just a quick kind of story. The plan is not all difficult to follow, if you are really considering what is going on. Maybe I'm just because I see movies from so many things like acting, conspiracy, etc. I'm not a "interpreter" or anything that takes a movie away, just comes. So he said, I believe this is the most beautiful movie really, despite the future as a cult-classic, blockbuster, or nothing. <br /> <br /> And the characters, of course there is no doubt about how the differences are. I believe the cast is best if both are doing their best to show their images effectively, so they make women and filmmakers. All characters are very special and include that you get to witness a small piece of each of their lives, keeping them far away. Basically, I personally wanted to be healed by the characters. All who live and burn this film probably don't see it as I do, or don't accept it. It does not matter, this is a good film in its own right, no, it's the best film period.
