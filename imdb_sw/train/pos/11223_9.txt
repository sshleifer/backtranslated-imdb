Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the world of gambling boast. Various stages and wrists had to learn if throwing craps is the skill and itself. <br /> <br /> There are a few surprises. AS as modern as we have today, I was fully expecting a 'beautiful girl' to be crying on her grave, instead of her Buddy. Especially with his words on 'going to the funeral of his best friend', when he first meets Matt. And of course you expect Matt to kill the man who beat the battery of the battery in the face of Mr. Allen, missing him (an interesting role with Bruce Dern). WRROOONNNNGGG !!! some of the rest of Hollywood takes place, but writing is very good, the acting is done carefully that you don't know without joy. And the music is of this world. To send us back to 50 years when our 'natural desires' were introduced by Ray Charles and Bo Diddley's music. Even minority discrimination takes its ugly head in Chicago, but in a so-called, 'Biloxi' and the Confederate flag that supports racist views. I'll watch them again, just hear music. Good good I have the voice of the FACTOTUM sound, so I can listen to that on the car. Look at all together, and you will see how Matt has ceased .... play the characters of the bar room in both. NOO that owns a bar in the range of parks in NYC, may have a good opportunity to do his studies. The main impressions, only come in. He shows very good performances ... good and bad in his characters. His' boy 'in the field' is a good study, carried out mainly because of his bassett-hound eyes. He does love, and persuades. Since he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a young man, I wonder how that ... to make love to the kinda actress who grew up with him. Increases faith, I will say it.
