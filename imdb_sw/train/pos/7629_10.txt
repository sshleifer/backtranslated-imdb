Kurt Russell is Elvis, open and simple. His commitment to this role led to what I think, is the best movie bio ever. If you are a fan of Elvis, see if you can. <br /> <br /> The film made for television was held two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> One section of advice, there are two versions - one for 180 minutes and one for 117 minutes. The only one look is one more. The shortest hour has more than one hour planned. It does not only work because the events in it are often dependent on the selected events. <br /> <br /> This master takes you from the youth of Elvis through its emergence as the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (the real father of Kurt) is ideal as Elvis's parents. And Pat Hingle provides Col. Tom Parker is very capable. King / King Live!
