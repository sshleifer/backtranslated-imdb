Frailty is an incredible film that reaches its wonders by following logic and degradation / degradation. Father (we have not learned his name) is a gentle man with a loving father who is raising his children only after Mom died and gave birth to a little child, Adam. The family of the family is experiencing violence one night while Dad runs into the boys' room and tells them God has given him a vision. And what is the vision? The whole family work is to destroy the demon, who, of course, hides from human form. <br /> <br /> From this premise, the movie dies to follow. Does the father catch people / demons that God has told them to destroy, bind them, put their hands on them to see their visions of evil, and then kill them? while making his young children look. Fenton, an old boy, is scared, seeing only a father has turned into a brutal killer. Adam, the younger, is not surprising, but believes that the Father is following the will of God. Finally, the Father takes his sons to help them to take away the "demons" that God has placed on the fathers' list, and finally, invites them to participate fully in God's message for the family. <br /> <br /> This is not, you understand, bright father. He loves his children. He only follows God's instructions: "This is our work now, my son. We should do this." When Fenton, fearing and persuading his father gone mad, says he will tell the police, his father explains, "If you do, my son, I will die." The angel was clear about this. "The pressure that your children are subjected to is shocking and surprising, and it reduces their entire lives. , the stormy weather, and the high stability in the present day increases the risk of backstory. However, I wanted to believe that I was looking at the human tragedy, rather than the story of God's punishment. The vision of the Father, and this, like other holes of the conspiracy, was a problem for me. act as an angel of death? (1) Roger Ebert review, 4/12/02
