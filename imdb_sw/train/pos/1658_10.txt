If you have seen this film, you have found Puerto Rico. I have lived all my life in Puerto Rico, and must be ashamed to admit that we (PR) live in real chaos now, drugs are the main reason for shooting and murder we have almost every day. These people will beat anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent people are lost because of this. We do not feel safe again, and beyond this, what is called "justice" has not been guided by truth and justice, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" depends on the real, sad things, and actually shows the three major problems of Puerto Rico: killings associated with drugs, money and power that run our courts, and innocent people and children are destroyed and even die because this. Ricardo and his wife, Poli, with their real-to-life plot and their way of winning awards (**), were brave enough to present all of this as bad: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living badly ended !!! ** Recently won the "Copper Ball Award" for the Best Director of the World Cinema Tournament at the Phoenix Film Festival of 2006.
