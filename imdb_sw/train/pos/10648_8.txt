What can I say about the "Haunting"? It has everything that makes beautiful pictures. Soft pieces, music stacks, and sound sound design for both were in place. However, sometimes, it makes sense to it in such a wonderful, surgical way. The whole team must be forgotten to read it through, perhaps because they were too busy to create cg effects and a set of gothic to create a weak plot. Each member of the cast provides good performance, although with little loyalty to the available material. Lili Taylor has more to do while others do. But that's about it. All I can say is that it is twice as much fun, but you will need more. Much more.
