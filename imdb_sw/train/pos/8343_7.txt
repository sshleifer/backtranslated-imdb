Australia Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) leads this comedy / romance which is fun, relaxing, and put in spring. You will laugh while watching this film. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is a mechanic auto, Ed Walters, consisting of IQ's top, which grows with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Older Persons) and his professional friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them for preppie shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, Has Letter) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's nephew who is a skilled expert, but not bold. Perhaps it is because he is surrounded by all those thoughts. He thinks that if he married a man with the highest I.Q. his children will have I.Q. also, but he doesn't know what he wants. Among the beautiful smile of Tim Robbins and the cuteness of Meg this is an enjoyable movie. I love good stories. All people should enjoy this film. Catherine is involved in jerk James Moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very stuffy. This is the love of the first type of sight, between the plant and the mathematical expert. Witty lines and subliminal lines! Style is beautiful. Princeton, New Jersey is good at Spring. With great help from all skilled people Catherine falls to Ed, not knowing that he is mechanic of cars. Favorite Scenes: Ed take multiple choice choices in front of the crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt, and Boris. Ed and Einstein climbing a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris free all the animals of the study! >::: Ed Walters: "He was at the end time" Wahoo? "Catherine Boyd:" Well I'm sure I don't know. "This is an enjoyable movie, I recommend.
