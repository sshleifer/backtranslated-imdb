... as I was seeing this film I did not see this film again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it was so scared! As I said, I had 14 when my English teacher decided to show us; The reason for this is that we have been reading the quotations from the book. All girls in my class had been given when Black Woman came through the window and floating on Kidd's bed, though, just before there was something that was too frightening, which was when Kidd got a toy soldier of his river, and he hears the voice of the child saying "It is for you". The area still hates me to this day, nearly 7 years after watching the film. <br /> <br /> If you are scared easily, FINDA FILIA THIS !!!!!!!!
