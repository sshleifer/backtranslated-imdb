Hamlet is far from all of my Shakespeare work. Branaugh is one player of the actress. His description of this was just amazing. His soliloquies were breathing. As long as it was normal for the film to hold my interest, however I participated in this piece. I recommend this to every fan of shakespeare and those not so much. This has everything that the modern world looks at in its films: murder, betrayal, and fraud. Not knocking the version of Mel Gibson, but Branaugh's children touch the whole job. This has no leaves turning. When you finish the film it will feel like you are reading to play for yourself. Um how you say "thumbs up up".
