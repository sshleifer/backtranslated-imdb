I agree with what "veinbreaker" wrote about "Ahhhh" hearing you get at the end of this movie. I really liked the films they chose, the songs were well written and interesting, especially to track the sound of the psychedelic which Hans Matheson sings. It's trippy. The brother was working in his role, nail "was closed", Beano was a regular player, and Rea put it together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helena was a good partner. But I felt Juliet Aubrey's performance was good. Events between Aubrey & Robinson kill me! Played perfectly with the music behind the scene was spot on! Many musicians are not bad to watch this movie out! They should do! I've told all my friends of music. The main quote of Jimmy Nail's character: "is supposed to be rock & roll, not Phantom's f ***** g opera!"
