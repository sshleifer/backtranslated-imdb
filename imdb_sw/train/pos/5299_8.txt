Once you can adopt the title of the film, "Pecker" is a good film, perhaps one of the best of John Waters. Wonderful casting, led by powerful performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story seem very interesting, realistic. There are some terrible events that are not recommended for young children, but it's there for a purpose. Unfortunately this film was not generated, and most people will be denied a chance to see it. If the space asks you, then go see this film.
