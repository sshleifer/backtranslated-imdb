I saw this experiment when it was first shown, and I am sure many fans of the "Spirit" hate, because, like Batman, Hornet Green etc, it took character to "camp". But I definitely didn't have enough for Batman, because I thought it was entertainment, in other ways such as show. There are two parts that sit with me. First, when Denny's partner has been seriously injured, and gives an amazing speech on how she was standing by the law, and listening to the real letter of it. Then, he says something like, "Boy, I was joking!" What way to tell Denny to be vigilante instead, which he does (though type TV Batman). Then, there is a place where he tries to mislead the ignorance in letting him go to kiss, but he has not missed, because he is very faithful kissing to convince him! This was a good example of "camp", which was also "chosen", and actor and executive.
