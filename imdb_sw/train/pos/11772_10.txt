In one of the shorts restructuring the Bugs Bunny's stir, the famous leporid * works in a shop shop case, when the owner Gildersleeve decides to do her things. Of course, this proves almost impossible, since Bugs knows the shop better than Gildersleeve (and knows when crossing). As always, they put everything at a high speed, and so you need to ask how hilarious cartoon this should be when it first started! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how Looney Tunes looked at '40s before the crowd of Termite Terrace. But do not make mistakes, cartoons were still very good after the refined form. <br /> <br /> However, this is good. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and hares.
