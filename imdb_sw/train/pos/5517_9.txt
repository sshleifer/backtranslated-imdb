No: Part One was an exciting attempt, which not only says a very interesting story, but also tried to do something different from the biopic type: For the second part it is the end of this test. <br /> <br /> This movie offers all the same features from the first, from the amazing performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) toward Steven Soderbergh's guide, without forgetting its intention to break down common rules from biopics. what I like from the Soderbergh experiment ... always trying to do something different and unusual, and it always succeeds. The last message from this film is perfect, and it combines everything we have was told about Che Guervara's life. The only failure I got on Che: The second part is that the smaller parts felt that they were useless. In summary, I offer Che: The second part of enthusiasm is because, as the first, it is a bold and fascinating attempt from the viewer's challenge and leaves us to think.
