I saw this film on television many years ago and I saw this film when I got this on the tape. I thought this had done well. It wasn't the best movies, but it was good enough. Movie has enough talent to encourage many people, especially young children. Acting was good, and Danny Glover led the cast. The plot line was not believed, but the script was well written. This movie can also be the interest of football fans. It doesn't go directly into a full-game film. It automatically uses a good film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages hidden in this film. In general, the film was good, but not good. I offer this 7/10 film.
