Although Super Mario 64 is not like other games in the series, it is still common and is quite similar to old games. Games with this replay value are few and in the middle. More, this game has a lot of variety. There are 15 levels each with different tasks that you can do, and many other hidden jobs. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not take the game entirely. If you hit, you will need to delete your game and start again. And her joy was the second time, or the third time, or when two hundred. A must have any Nintendo 64 owner, and is the reason for having Nintendo 64.
