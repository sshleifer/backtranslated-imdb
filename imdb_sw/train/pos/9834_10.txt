It is certainly cheesy, not Zombie, but it's not bad either. It has a Beatrice Ring which is a great bonus, and it's entertainment. I was fortunate to meet Fulci later in his career and remained a philosophy of experience, for he was not quite satisfied with that. It's good to search for search, especially for girls and Fulci fans. It's a film that is often dismissed.
