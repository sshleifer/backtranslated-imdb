Perhaps the best book of Isabel Allende, the House of the Spirit describes an alternative history of pride, this is full of magic, a mystic lid, with some kind of abnormal sadness. This movie collects great cast, with great art of art, and script which can not be the quality of this book. It is not uncommon for a country that is not known as Chile to be carried out as well as this film, which is probably only a very high goal, and because it left people with illiteracy, especially because they understood very little.
