"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that has not been discussed regularly. The film is only available in the lower VHS format. It is a disgrace to this film not given to DVD. "Erendira" is stunning and beautiful with its magic-real pictures. "Erendira" depends on a short story from the novel "100 Years of Trinity". Erendira is constantly shouting and accidental fire to his grandmother's house. Her grandmother, played with Irene Papas, puts her in prostitution to pay damages. The whole city gets a piece of Erendira, by saying. Although the issue is complex, the film does not use sex. It is done in the form of mature art. Movies also has amazing dress. Some of the most surreal elements of the most sophisticated films are the origami birds that are in the actual plane, and the golden orange with diamond in the middle. Erendira is an amazing film, that even manages to throw with humor. Certainly this is a film that deserves the release of a special DVD. If they could say in espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
