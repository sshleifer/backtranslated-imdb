Burlinson and Thornton provides excellent performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Although it is the first time you think that just about love, it really goes down than that. Natural beauty attracts this movie, and puts it among the best one I have ever seen. Horse Scenes are absolutely amazing! Any horse lovers out there will love this film! <br /> <br />
