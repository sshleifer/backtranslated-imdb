Another good taste of the superhero movie should be after the Batman: The Last End which only helps to stimulate our delicious buds and leaves us want more! That's the real movie of superhero should look like and feel like! Even this hard is a fanfilm of type. Priority for details, character and action is definitely true. Although this is a small resource, it creates a great disgrace to the budget, composed of stars, has created "other" shows of superhero movies. Here the characters and chiefs work and seem like they are real people. Finally, Superman which actually looks "super" and looks like a real thing! Batman way that should be, without the cast of the ball, blows the arms of the body to hide a scrawny physique for more paid executives who do not get. I just want Warner Bros. A wise exec will give OK to produce the full length of this stone. I don't care if it goes to the movies or directly on the DVD, I can't despair of looking at it. Only the plot itself has the value of my hard dough for this. Hope "bigwigs" in the production of Marvel & DC watch and see what real movie produced superhero should look. No more "Batman & Robin" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc.. Learn from these short-term directors and know that there should be no reason to "restore" the hero for film, so that only "bomb" in the movie. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
