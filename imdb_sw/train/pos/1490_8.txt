Everyone has a first love, and although it is difficult to define that feeling when you are young, there you are, lying in you. That is how Malaysia's filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad is trying to prove in his fourth element, the movie where most of the emotional feelings are described through simple fraud, similar. That way is very simple in this case, if the story of love on the film's basis involves 12-year-olds, and thus making any experiments in the "deep" analysis seem confident. That they are not also an extraordinary exhibition made by non-actors, Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip. Former warfare (already seen as adult behavior in the original photo of Ahmad, Gubra), a lovely girl, next to the striker who, perhaps caused by "his birth" in England (his mother studied in the UK), refuses to play with dolls, preferring to play violent games with boys. Then one day he met Mukhsin (Naswip), who came to spend a vacation at his aunt's house, and suddenly he changed his behavior: fistfights, good-riding bicycle-riding and climbing trees. But what does this mean? Are they just friends, or is it more commonly known, something that is not yet ready to understand, let's just accept? <br /> <br /> From the age of the characters, answering these questions are not possible, and so, as in several "small" films (Lost in Translation comes to mind), there is no real closure, the option behind the hope, but ultimately satisfactory: natural operation, unfiltered (especially Aryana) reaches the heart once, and healing power (the most written family) helps to keep a small story of fun and cheating. The low-to-earth approach is not to be effective (hilarious subplot about the neighborhood of adultery has dropped too early), and it is difficult to prove a wonderful reference to Pulp Fiction at the beginning of the element, but the emotional power of the romance of the young is enough to do this an interesting piece of free Asian movies.
