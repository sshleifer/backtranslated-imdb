"Against All Flags" is every classic swashbuckler. It has all the features of the fan's adventure can hope and more for this, the girl in distress is, well, not in distress. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is the best player, runs its enemies in a way that is against the social norms of the period. Anthony Quinn surrounds many third-party actors like Captain Captain Roc Brintana and shows that it is a powerful and powerful nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For a fan of classic adventure, "against all flags" is a must-see. Although it may not be in the same league with some of the earlier works of Errol Flynn (Captain Blood and Sea Sea, for example), it is still very great.
