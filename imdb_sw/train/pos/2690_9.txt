La Teta i La Luna (Breast and Month) describes the life of a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete who has come up with breast-growing breast cancer. I love this film because the characters are very loyal to the human race, like all the characters in Bigas Luna movies (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how exciting and exciting life can be at that age. Also from Catalonia (North-eastern Spain) brought much memory to my mind. This movie shows how good Catalunya is, good people, good lives and especially many people who are not biased.
