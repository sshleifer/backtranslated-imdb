'Una Giornata Particolare' is a movie with a header that appears to be familiar I thought I saw immediately. Now that I have finally seen it, I am very happy. This is one of the best Italian movies I have known, and one of the most spectacular performances by Marcello Mastroianni, whose stars in other talents such as 'La Dolce Vita' and '8 1/2', both from Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola, this is a movie that takes time to set up characters and slowly continues stories a special day, Adolf Hitler's day visited Rome. Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele, the neighbor of Antonietta (Sophia Loren). He is a member of the Mussolini party, very good in his mind, and he is no longer a messenger. The reason I will not reveal. On that day everyone from their building, including her husband and children, is out to see Hitler, is still in the building. Antonietta's flight runs and jumps on Gabriele's floor, and that's how the two meet. Before Antonietta went to Gabriele, he thought of suicide, and because I did not reveal it. How the story comes from here I do not reveal, but what happens between two that makes this special day, not the fact that Hitler is in Rome. <br /> <br /> As I said, Mastroianni has a good performance. You see he is a person who desires someone around him, although for the first time we don't know why. Maybe he likes Antonietta, he might be he likes her, there may be another reason. Antonietta feels we feel. What does this person want from him? He loves attention however. We see how she makes her hair look attractive to that person. Loren plays well too. We understand his questions, although we can't guarantee what his goals are. When we see all their secrets, if so you can call it, it's a good time. How the story comes from there is even more interesting, but I don't want to lose it to you. This is a movie you should see. A great show and a great movie, and a message gives us still standing today.
