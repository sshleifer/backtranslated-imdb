Let's start with the theme of the theme called Christopher Cross. The song is "If you find between New and New York City." It's a beautiful theme and song even after all these years, is not available. In fact it is a great song about New York City too. However, the great stars of Dudley Moore CBE as an observer of spoiled alcoholism is responsible for the behavior of Jill Eikenberry in the film. Jill could star the future on LA LA. However, he is used by his wonderful British pastor, Sir John Gielgud OM who won the Academy Award for his performance in the film as Actor Best Supporting. Arthur likes the character of Liza Minnelli who is perfect in this film instead of his performance in his role in winning Oscar in Cabaret. No, Liza can't sing. She plays the dinner. However I would like Geraldine Fitzgerald as a bach pastor of the family who decides the family luck. However, he is extraordinary and should get a professional prize for himself to the best executive assistant. Barney Martin is known as Jerry's father on Seinfeld's father of Liza. He is also great. The movie was well written, acted, and sent to the audience who wanted more.
