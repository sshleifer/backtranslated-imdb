I had to see this on the flight to NZ last week, and I was wondering how it could reach the UK film and book. I think I had a good feeling. If anything shared with the Red Market during the dirty years works better than the initial commitment to Arsenal FC, who have succeeded for years. As Brit I was also keen to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what is going on. One question focuses on mind - Is the screenplay written using Sox as a team even before finally breaking the curse of Bambino? Or is another team in shape? As a Red Sox fan (weird know, Brit who understands baseball) I can say that it has increased with joy.
