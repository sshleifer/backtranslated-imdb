Million Fire is a good movie for every way. Fun stories, breach and good performances with four professionals who have worked in the business. Peter Ustinov is a brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith â€” definitely one of the most executives of all time - is perfect happiness. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart are all around the outside and also perfect. If you want a full film, this is. What is surprising is how these people work in a natural and powerless way, and create lots and lots of fun. Peter Ustinov was well versed with a good sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Trends, photography, and editing are also the first level, and is a great capsule during London in '60s. It's obvious on my list of favorites at all times.
