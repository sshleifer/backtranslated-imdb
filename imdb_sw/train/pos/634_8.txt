I was one of 200 people who were lucky to see sneak early of this film. Stickust follows Tristan's boy in an attempt to get a fallen star and bring the woman back to prove his love for him. The only thing is that the star dropped on the other side of the wall, the door between Britain and the magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This film was just fun to watch, it has something in everyone, all the events of the drama are made for beauty and comedy spread through a funny film without being corny. If I had to compare with my favorite film, maybe it should be Mrs. Princess, classic. All shows are best, beautiful Claire Danes makes you smile in its show of Yvaine star credible and low and counted Michelle Pfeiffer provides stellar on high performance like Larnia ... but the talking of talking is Robert De Niro ... In every area that has hands down steals show ... <br /> <br /> If you have a love story of a fantastic story of this fantasy is a film. The boys are not forced by the details there is enough comedy to act and not mention the eye of the eye and Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you. The movie is defined and continues to feel for the film ... nothing about the film seems forced.
