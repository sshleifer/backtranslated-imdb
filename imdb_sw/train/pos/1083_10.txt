Another example of the unique talent of Cary Grant. Performance is eligible for an Oscar investigation, but once again it has been blocked by the Academy. Mr. Grant runs a gamut from fraud to tender in this amazing comedy about a man who decides to move from the capital. The building restrictions of the house are good and they were the foundation (freely) for the modern Tom Hanks car, "Money laundering". <br /> <br /> If you love good old comedy without curses and free sex, this movie must see.
