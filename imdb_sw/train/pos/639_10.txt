This is a good show of family and very popular characters. It is a good break from the fact of blitz's late show. There is nothing else on TV now or, unless you count Joan of Arcadia to be the same because it has a young character as well. However, the Clubhouse deserves to look at because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of merit and naivet√© which impresses without being overly sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out of the main members cast, and each one is severe in their place. I really like Kirsten Storms as the sister of Pete Betsy; he is a pill, but still cares for his mother and brother, although he hates to show. It can take a few moments to get feet, but the Clubhouse is one of the best performances to come at a good time, so look at people - you will be glad you did!
