A shock shock, Bonnie's wife, and their newborn children Kenyon and Nancy were so loved and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas - but early 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered. Instead of expecting, the crime made sense to the author Truman Capote, who fled to the area and followed the course of the case for his conclusion. The result was the book of INAWA BACK. Competing, surprisingly, and precisely well written, became the best international supplier and is still a touchstone for crime writers to this day. The 1967 version of the Capote film work is very close as the book itself. Printed in black and white colors in many areas of real life, it has a low-quality document, ic and has been extracted - and general stripes are unique. This is a film that characterizes Robert Blake as the actress rests, and it deserves it. As a Perry Smith killer, Blake brings you into the greatest trouble and unexpected sympathy; is a good performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is not at all low. As a Capote book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock when they are going to Kansas and bringing them to the Futter home - just as it passes through the crash in detail investigation which eventually led to arrest and trial. A piece of film has always been a time when we finally see what happened in a group of groups; in fact closed in the home of the group itself, is a sequence of spinechilling, awesome and terrible. Director and author Richard Brooks directs the film with a very strong decision-making decision, just guilty because he allows the film to be a little preaching. Due to the overall strength of the film, however, this becomes a small hatred. Strong items - and recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer
