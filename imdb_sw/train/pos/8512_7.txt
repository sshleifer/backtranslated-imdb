I can tell you how this movie is bad. I was in the movies and I didn't see them yet, but I am thinking of anyone who pays to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did that year. The thing is that they probably edited. Especially the area where my partner was blowing the coke of the angel of Mexico (perhaps they should follow him). We made a few come up with a visual appearance but far from that I can't remember anything. I was a MC in a few cases (from what I was told.) What I can tell you is that everyone avoided camera employees since who wants to be remembered as someone who climbed or a girl who showed her tits to the world (or that lost girl lost her daughter). itself was of things but people make a difference when the camera is on them.
