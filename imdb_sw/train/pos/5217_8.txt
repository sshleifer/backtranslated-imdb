I got this movie late at night on the cable, and I was very happy. I can only think why this movie is not well known, because the issue is so confusing. But if you can address the topic of sexual abuse, it is good to act, exciting and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good in it. And although the issue is not in the heart of despair, the film does not give its way to being brutally either (like 8mm for example). <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies.
