Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest to fight India's independence to ignore his family and son, this movie is about his son Hiralal who feels that he has been neglected because of Ghathi's community service. The movie starts in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of India's independence against Britain. Hirarala comes to South Africa to help her father who is a barrister, since gandhi was involved in the struggle for independence, wanted his wife and children to join and as a community service and because hirarlal does not get a chance to finish his education and fail his experiment, married with love his gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal hopes to travel to England and become a barrister like his father, but his own father refuses to pay him a tax for his family and a businessman and instead drives away from another person saying that forgiveness should not be limited to his family and should be clear to the student who is eligible The more that lives in the colony. This irritates the allergy and shock between the father and the child increases, hirarlal hates his father by rejecting him and blaming him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal strives to reach the end and growing on the street through a failed trade experiment with a huge debt, losing his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has made a stellar performance like Hiralal gandhi .. everything to him, the direction and script is amazing, the pictures are excellent. generally the best movie and should see it. I offer 10/10
