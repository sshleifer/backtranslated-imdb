Okay, it's not a perfect film in any way but I disagree with the general IMDb view that is very bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990s and I liked it at that time. I didn't see 'Black Mask' at the time and we saw last week for the first time. In addition to the poor dubbing that my DVD discount does not give you an opportunity to switch off, the film has raw energy and bravado which hit Hong Kong movies at this time. I am still engaging in my gun in the opinion that, during the action, these boys, regardless of their budget, add a magic feature on no Bourne Uuwala screen, Casino Royale or Mission It is impossible (I do not know these movies - I just feel they have no shortage of this and feel also regulated) he will reach. What is it? It is a feeling that filmmakers were trying to shoot and edit, not afraid to leave certain obstacles to learn lessons for the future. For me, this makes watching movies, more fun and more dangerous.
