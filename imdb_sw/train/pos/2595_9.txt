The positive reform of the monologues of the Interior of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom and Joseph Strick in restoring the beautiful picture of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - the day of celebration - double the target entender! Bravo Strick director, journalist Haines, as well as the design and cinema director in creating this work. The Gunter Grass novel, The Drum Tin played by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is an alternative to the interactive film that I am similar to the Strick film. Even though there are clear Dublin symbols in the original novel and in the film, there are also known characters, although with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan who Dedalus lives is becoming a famous dancer of Dublin. <br /> <br /> This film for all its quality has been made even rich and extra views. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com 15 June 2008
