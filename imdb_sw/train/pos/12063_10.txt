The black woman (1989) is a TV set of the modern story of Susan Hill, published a few years earlier than the film made. Unfortunately, this film has not been opened on DVD, and as far as I know it has been removed from the VHS. Access is very different from its popularity among those who know terrible films. This story deals with events in the sea community at the beginning of the 20th century where a small representative is sent by his company to complete the issues of a widow who recently died, who died on his private property. What he thought would be a normal and frightening task becomes hard as he discovered that an old woman was haunted to her death, and that her old spirit was not good to rest. The story is told by cunning but short, never being defensive, flashy or over-expositional exposure. Of course open budget can be a contribution to no-nonsense techniques, but it's just a story it needs, and why it works well. What you can't see is scary. After saying this, there is one horrible scene that depends on the visual, and it works perfectly. I watched this film during the day, and it had given me a night vision about a week later. If you would like to be scared, do what you should get and see a woman's photograph in Black.
