The good story of the Pimlico community in London who, after an unlocked WW2 bomb explosion, find the Royal Convention indicates that the area they live is part of the Bourgogne. <br /> <br /> This game works because it attracts many fantasy we have about creating our rules and we don't have to hear them. The strong source of British beacons, especially Stanley Holloway, is doing the best possible. <br /> <br /> There is a very good time in the film, as when people have lost equipment and the rest of London on the other side of the barricade start to throw food and other items on them.
