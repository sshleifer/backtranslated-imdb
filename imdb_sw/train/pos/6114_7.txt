Very good movie that has similar to hit-2001 "My Sassy Girl" but has the most magic power time. The great applause should go in two ways. Ha-Neul Kim is good and beautiful, Sang-woo Kwon is all interesting and rebellious. Chemistry between two is very good. Kyeong-hyeong director Kim uses the CG insertion for pepper on the picture and also provides the anti-strange scenes which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I loved him better than here "High Volcano". And the boy has a future - those who seem to be, those ways of fighting, and romantic leadership. Not bad. Well, I can make it short: Beautiful film. My rating: 7/10
