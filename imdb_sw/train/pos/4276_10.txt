At first sight, who is singing more there seems to be just a wonderful comedy and better? and just kind of common, quiet and slow: it's done! Starting with two singers in the desert landscape, then with a group of wonderful artists, hiding gem! The fictional story, and the fake voice makes you think, yes it is comic, but it lets you just think it will be a kind of gentle film. It is not entirely: very funny and instant, dark trick of ignorance to others, its development of surprise you all along the story? Carefully and carefully, all the characters are important, and the actors give them a full life. And what is wondering, depends on a thorough investigation, a great skill of camera work and a great sense, and indeed everything, general trends and how these notes are presented, that just makes you forget the movie: it's like watching a human society, yet you don't know, shot with a friend behind the camera. And you are behind it. It's simple, and it's special! Do not tell us; in any way that would mean the script, the quality of the image, the color of the music and the type of amateur way, no, no! It is a very Art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? From the top of the mountain, towards the sea, with all kinds of types and peregrinations that the actual river will handle on its sea journey? from a little thing to a stream stream. This picture of the romantic image I used was the best way I can find to describe all the charm that has Which More Sing. For me, again, I take a hammer: just a unique ... I found that the Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is the popular stability? But if I haven't seen, I had no idea about this gentleman. Some experts wrote a trigonomic comment on the film, I fully agree! Eastern Europe Cinema does not know well because it is constantly translated, but I am fortunate to have one example in the original language, and passages in English well. All in all: deep, delicious and unique ... <br /> <br /> For the type of burst and malware and special effects events, avoid at any cost, it can be a trick and good for you! <Br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different types and / or classic, I think you can't regret this, and if you are buying, it will have a good fellowship in your personal DVD library, and not less than respected big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch, or Sacha Guitry among some of my preferred directors. At least for this film! <br /> <br /> *** The movie is never suitable unless the camera is awake in the head of the poet Orson Welles ***
