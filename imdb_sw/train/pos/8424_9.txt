That is my Bush is a life-step project carried out by the South American creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.The show was deleted after one season, not because of bad reviews (in fact it got a good reviews), but because it was too expensive .This is my bush is a beautiful spoof of the wonderful sitcom of a network of normal network. It is also a political satire. That is the closest place as beautiful as South Park, but it is a very funny spoof of Sitcom and also satire good satire.The boy plays in my bush looks very much like him! If you can get a show, check out there is a lot of laughing that! <br /> <br /> 9/10
