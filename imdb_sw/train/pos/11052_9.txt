When I was six, I learned about the "Los Campeones" series, and even if I was just a child I did everything I needed to convince my parents to let me watch "Champions" and "Avengers" once a week. I think it was the golden age of English series ... (I already have a full cycle of "Prisoner"!) But it also ended a few years later with "Tomorrow's People", "The Worst Witch" (just me, or this is "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, before I also want "Champions" to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I also wait for "Dr Nani" (packet series grown in a set of uhm, maybe 300 DVD, please, I could not use more, 8), "Tomorrow's people", and "other small budgets", but the great stories found within my areas were reached, say and understand English, but not all of my relatives, including my parents, who put me in these great stories ... I hope one day, one can feel the influence of this series and then they can sell it as I saw them before. It was published or with a header, but in the same format I saw. and put my TV!
