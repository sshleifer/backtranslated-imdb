What can I say about the first film ever? You can't count this rate, because it shouldn't be entertaining. But if you have a standard, you should give 10. It's amazing to see pictures moving from 1895. This was one of the most important movies in history. I wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
