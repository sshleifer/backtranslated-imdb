Here is this 10/10 Movie because it is worth 10/10. The two best-time actors-Walter Matthau & George Burns are collaborating with Neil Simon and all other actors who are in the film's film + Herbert Ross, and all of this makes this process possible. Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of over 70 years. I like the kind of humor in this film, it makes me laugh hard. I got this film on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was only $ 3). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to look again because I kept missing the first place. The second time I looked at it, I felt better, and I laughed too much. I am definitely going to get this on DVD because I see special features. It is very funny how it happens. Two people work together as travelers / actors / artists. They take part in the action, but in fact they say the action, they can't live another minute with each other, then 15 years later, you want to re-connect for a special TV. You can find that in this film. Matthau & Burns were severe in this film. It is a wonderful shame they died. George Burns deserved to be Oscar. He gave the performance of a strong comic. He was also 78 when this movie was hit. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive a professional award during old age. Jessica Tandy breaks record as an old actor. Richard Benjamin was also amazing in this. He won the Golden Globe for the best actor. He deserved that the Golden Globe. Although most people can compete with what I say, everyone in this film gave a great performance. This comedy is a classic acute. I strongly recommend. Another thing: Anyone who hates this movie is "Putz"
