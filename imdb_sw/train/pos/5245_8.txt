I thought this movie was LOL funny. It is a pleasure, not taken seriously, a film about one perverted view of life, love, and ... well, women "from a low-bus skank station, to a top-class bus station ... The Tim Meadows has a boy (Leon Phelps) who raised him in Playboy-style house with the father of Hugh Hefner-esquire, surrounded by all the beautiful photographs and actors. learn to make yourself without anything but a chauvinistic attitude about life that his youth has taught ... that and unknown, close to the mysterious level of charm and misfortune. And so hijinx starts! semi-useless, comedy / love story, then I recommend very lease "Ladies' Man".
