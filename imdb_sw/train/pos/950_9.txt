The layout and executives make this movie to me is the best version of Dickens's story. George C. Scott is believed as the others were beaten. Its scrooge tend to destroy until the end of the movie. Then his behavior changes to someone who is truly repentant. The 19th-century English city chosen for the environment creates an ideal path for Dickens and adds to the possibility of this film. It's a movie I watch every Christmas with a real Grinch and It's a Wonderful Life.
