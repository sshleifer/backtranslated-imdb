Finally I saw the deceptive "Ice Age". In addition to maybe not be as funny dead as I would after seeing a brilliant teaser no bad word I can say about it. Indeed, it is not as pleasant as the production of Disney (rather, it is the first attempt of the Fox on a full CG movie) but it has a great heart and sometimes (like to look at Manfred's eyes after seeing a sad past experience) and tears. But when they got the baby together with his father I couldn't manage them again. The movie that has no trouble walking on a narrow line of sappy and clich√© and manages to bring more than the best out of it; The end result will be one of the most innovative of the life I have ever seen. Great famous characters who grow rapidly (with great talent also) with many memorable pictures, especially from the Scrat's behalf to make the movie more than enough reason to give. With the Dodo area, which is my favorite private place in 2002. I really don't get it, but for some reason it seems like the CG animation will take a higher position in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this (and who can forget Pixar's creativity) then I don't really care, at least for now. 9/10
