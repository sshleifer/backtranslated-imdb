I ran to this film in the local video store during their annual sales. When you scan thousands of videos, hope to find a few movie cartoon movies, I've watched this film. I read the movie and I knew it was God's hand working for me to buy this film. You see, I have a group of three children (and recently rejected) children living with my family. Once my children developed a relationship with three children in the stars. Movie helped them understand their own situation. For the first time, too, an elder of a brother (age 7 / woman) decided to open me a little about his old condition and the trouble he had. He has been fighting the whole issue of trust. This is also the first time I have seen her cry. After watching the film, I asked him what the child meant. He replied, "It means to be happy." You must see for families that target children and consider adoption. Certainly opened communication lines with us.
