By responding to someone who made a comment about how the film is going on and who believed that there is no meaning for the role of Jess's brother here is my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is to provide a great variety of irony in the story . Craig Sheffer / Norman could predict the problems associated with life to the fullest extent by looking at what Jess's brother did. There are several cases where Brad Pitt and his life are consistent, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer on a shared bar and finally gets Brad Pitt a few days later. The biggest irony was when the character of Craig Sheffer had a great emotional problem for her brothers to death, knowing she could do more to stop it and eventually create more impressive feelings in the film.
