I watched the 'Ice Age'in cinema movies and I loved the movie. Despite the fact that 'Ice Age'has a lot of errors and scientific errors, like humanity, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoth living in the same period, and even where the story flows (apparently North America, but has a reputation for Iceland for example) fun yet (unless you are very strict!) <br /> <br /> The planet comes at the age of ICE, and many animals migrate to the south where there is heat. Sid is a stupid Sloth left by his own family, which cannot stand up again. When he was on his way, he met Manfred, or how he calls 'Manny' a lot of mammoth who doesn't care about disappearance or migration and it goes north. Concerned that he might easily be arrested, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the course of their journey, they found a human mother and her child. Mother dies but Manfred and Sid decide to take her back to the human race. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them go on a shortcut to a human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know, is that Diego is from the clan of saber who hates humanity and wants to kill the child, and also pretend to betray them all to make it a saber food. What will happen, will depend on the character of Diego and conscience ... <br /> <br /> aka "Era do Gelo" - Brazil
