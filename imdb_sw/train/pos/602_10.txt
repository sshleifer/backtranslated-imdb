I have never walked before the flamenco, but somehow I feel like this film was perfect. Colors, how to play dances, worries, and all the opponents put together made a film that lasted too short. I have seen some films of Carlos Saura and I agree that this film can be its best production. I feel that the best features of his old films were put together and connected to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in exploring the ongoing activity behind the camera. While watching this film I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, looking for the beauty of the bang players on a wooden board on a beautiful fruit cloth. For me, this film fits as a protection. I don't know how I can get a copy of this film in the United States in the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to other cultures. It's safe to say that this film is on my list of favorites.
