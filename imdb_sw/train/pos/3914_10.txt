Personally, I think that the film was done very professionally, I loved choreography and acting. The plan also fights with the extraordinary. The film itself is very emotional, and what I liked about it is that it makes you think later. Antonio Gades has lived entirely with his role to the end, and I must say that it is one of my pictures that is popular with Saura is a good director.
