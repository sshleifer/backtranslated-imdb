Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point." It was a good romantic romantic pleasure which by chance did not have a star Woody Allen. It had Scarlett Johansson good in it. <br /> "Scoop" is a Woody Allen film and though it looks at this one, it's okay. It also features Scarlett Johansson and two of them are doing full work together. Johansson has Sondra Pransky, a young college writer who gets life from Joe Strombel's spirit (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the match as he climbed the boat with a bad aggregate and a group of other spirits that Reaper took. One of these is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) He tells Joe that Peter can be a serial killer around England's streets. Joe, having a lifetime, returns to the living and gives this information to Sondra, during the practice of witchcraft. Sondra is on a magic show with Wizard Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). We do not know what to do, he helps the help of Sid Waterman to help him clear the case. This film has a good heart heart feel compared to the "Match Match" and still works all the way. Johansson and Allen work together. Allen's humor is suitable for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is as bright as Peter Layman, the defendant of the "defendant". <br /> <br /> This is a small fun movie to see if you're looking for someone to watch. The pieces used are well used with the story flowing and sometimes forget that Woody Allen is looking at himself. I say give them the opportunity because you can just love it.
