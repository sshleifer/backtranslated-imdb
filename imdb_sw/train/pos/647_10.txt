Indeed, of course, women are very harsh and poor on average, which is surprisingly displayed from the mother for adultery, although not pseudo-artistic, carefully, or negatively. Unlike many of you have just seen La Maman and La Putain twice. Many beautiful movies, I saw my thoughts on it improved after a second look. All I know is what I have seen and I have not yet spent even more until I have found dvd. I still don't know why I enjoy this film very much, but in fact, what do I care about? Although I am sure I will be able to make a good explanation. Okay, so you might disagree, maybe it's time to ignore, not an expert. Blonde reminds me of the beautiful Grushenka.
