I am a C&C fan, returning to their record, and loving this film, but one time in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose California, it was founded by another line of plot that destroyed the entire film. All marijuana references were changed by "diamonds". The Fund "Red" falls to Chong has a diamond in it instead of a dog, but the conversation is still the same ("... has value $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a small section in which ships of the ships were added to explore C&C, and talk about getting diamonds. At the end, instead of "coke space", it's something else. I don't know who created this version, but it was terrible, and obviously they were trying to make the family / child friendly. It would have been better if the network had never been.
