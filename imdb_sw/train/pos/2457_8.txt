When you are in a bad or sad situation, watch this film. It shows a lot of beauty and happiness in a very simple daily environment, and it is very encouraging, especially from the woman and the human perspective. When you know Turkish language or Danish or German language, see the film in any case. Half of the talks are Danish in nature, which is similar to German in the version of the translation, half of the Turkish, with the title of Danish or German, respectively. I looked at Mannheim, Germany, the audience of Turkish audiences showed that there must be a lot of humor in Turkish conversation, which, to a large extent, was running away from me, since it was not fully released in heads. However, the film is interesting even if you don't have Turkish skills. Indeed, movies are playing a lot on the speed and speed. At first glance, there is a lot of movement of the body as quickly as lightning, making it fast, a disturbed film. In particular, although this is a movie of Kung Fu, look for driving events, to show the beauty of emotions. But there are very few, emotional emotional sessions, too. And above all, the characters develop a little more than you would expect in the drama; yet, there is some movement in the characters for: Welcome to Omar host, whose part and work I loved very much. The speed and stability difference helps with the effectiveness of human anger and glory - once displayed, for the same characters, at the same time.
