If it is an action and adventure you want on the film, then you would better advise you to look elsewhere. On the other hand, like a lazy day and want a good movie to go along with the same feeling, see "Similar Stories." Richard Farnsworth puts a compelling function as gently with Gentlemanly Alvin Sawa, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a runner in three countries to see his brother who was a stranger with a stroke. Farnsworth is perfect in this role, since he travels long and windy roads, making friendly friends and giving them many advice on family on the way. The story goes with the slower as a climbing player, but in some way he can look at the viewer, waiting for the second lesson Alvin will give. <br /> <br /> Scroll to bed, relax and enjoy. It is the only way to watch this beautiful movie, which has a 7/10 rate in my book.
