"Mouse In The House" is a very classic cartoon with Tom & Jerry, loyal to their traditional but with own joke. It is a hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and amusing. Art is a good quality either. This shorter is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and tries to find the mouse too, because the «there is only one cat in the house this morning - and that's the cat that gets the mouse». <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny corners in this cartoon. Funniest for me is, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy sleeping sleeping and says sarcastically "I enjoy you are enjoying a siesta" and that he expects to be satisfied because he is not, and making two cats eliminates. Another strange gag is when Tom hides himself as Mammy Two Shoes with Butch slams and fry pan and then Butch doesn't have the same trick for Tom. Of course, even fundier than this, it's when Real Mammy Shoes looks and all (dumb!) Cat think they see each other hiding as Mammy and then two of them attacking her on "back" - lol. Usually he gets mad and once he swims, he's not a man to mix with. But even Jerry doesn't win this time, because he is expelled too.
