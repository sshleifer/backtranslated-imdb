After watching the trailer I was surprised that this film did not do it on the movie, so I ordered BluRay. I had a good time to look at it and say that this film is better than big animation movies out there. Of course, it has its mistakes but still I can recommend it. Animation has been done well, very entertaining and unique and legendary stories looking at all the way to the end. Some back rear is just a fall-dead good and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought that Forest Whitaker's performance is worthless but that Lian-Chu's behavior is shown in this film. So in general, the ulcer ulcer I liked so much and I hope it will succeed enough for all the studios to continue to make good movies like this. I would suggest giving you a chance and wonder how a great movie could have a small budget. Hektor alone is worth watching the film since some of its time is Stitch-like hilarious.
