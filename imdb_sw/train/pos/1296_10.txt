It is a very complicated film to watch, especially if it focuses on the inner core of our whole life. But finally it's a very good and moving film. Anyone who finds that I am worried I must say that they must have missed the idea of ​​the entire film. For those who are really watching the film, they will see that the ways in which issues are addressed are very important, and the result is ultimately uplifting. Indeed, it is very difficult to watch, a hard thing and even cruel. Yet it is very important for the community and everyone. It shows what the world film is doing at this time (I can't limit the time to France only) and everyone should try to see it. I will say it is better to go with a clear head without stripes and a contradictory view, and just allow the film to work for you.
