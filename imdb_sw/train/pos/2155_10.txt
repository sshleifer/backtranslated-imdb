Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) feels motivated by his normal life, to work hard and stay at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his young daughter. One night, on his way to the train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the balcony of the dance school, and a few days later, she decides to visit the school and take the ballroom dance lessons every Wednesday night. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret. Meanwhile, Masako feels a change in the character of her happy husband, and employs a private eye to investigate whether Shohei is doing something. I have finished watching "Will we?" and I loved it very much. What a beautiful and beautiful movie! Myths are beautiful, amazing, drama, comedy and romance. Sent is the best, and I was very impressed with the beauty of the winter and the grace of the wife of Masayuki Suo's director and the professional ballet artist Tamiyo Kusakari. In last September, I saw the US remake of "Are We Dansu?" for the first time, and I got good entertainment. But now I can say it is another unwanted remake, and I recommend this original film instead. Voting for me is ten. Headline (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with me?")
