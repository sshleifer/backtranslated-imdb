WOW! This film is a life-saving agreement, I think, of what happened 9-11-01 in NYC, compared to anything depicted by media outlets. Those stores can only show you what happened outside. This film shows you what happened in INSIDE. It starts with a view of a new firewall of New York, waiting a week for the first great fire to be called to fight. This lesson is suddenly turning to a CIRCLE OF FREEDOM OF THE WAR. You are given the front seat of the line as fire fighters flee to the area, into the lobby of one tower. At the moment before the second plane crash, and the second tower falls, you see the people of fire responding to the powerless voices of people walking on the lobby. It's the eyes that forget to forget. The heart of heartbeat, denial of tears, and compelling it from the first minute to the end, "9/11" deserves to decline in history as one of the best films. We should not forget. <br /> <br />
