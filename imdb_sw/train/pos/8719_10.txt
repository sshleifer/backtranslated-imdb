I was surprised by the improvements made in the animation film. If you sit next to the screen, you will see details on grass and face structures. Details, colors, and shading are at least a command of superior size than Toy Story. How they could erase shading, I never know. I hope that PIXAR will issue a document on how the film was released so that I might know how all this has been fulfilled. According to this film, I think the future animation films will be judged on the basis of this film.
