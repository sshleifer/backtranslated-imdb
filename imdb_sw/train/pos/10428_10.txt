The amazing movie which, in theory, should be boring but it is given to the trick and wonder to act that I have long desired to get ever. Instead of relying on the clich√©s and the recommended time, the plot opens through a series of incredible moments. Leaders are not perfect, so they relate to them as people you know is easy. The movie does not attempt to pull a laugh, or push the best on the audience but only show us the possibility of true love in any situation. Now I have waited to wait for the weekend so I can see the good. Exciting, stimulating thoughts, easily looking for love that I think you should be a romantic attraction there with Casablanca and Breakfast in Tiffany. It will reduce even the most powerful heart.
