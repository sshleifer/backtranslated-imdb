FLAVIA HERETIC is an incredible entry into the kind of nunsploit - the same part of the sleaze, the female trips, and the "history" when we follow Flavia on her amazing journey. We start with Flavia at the meeting. It is not very happy there because it does not believe in all the "laws" that men are led by men and eyes of the world around him and flee from the tribal assembly and his Jewish pal, Abraham. Both are eventually taken by Flavia to a meeting of worship where she joins another "unbeliever" in urging the Islamic invasion. Flavia hang out with Muslims who take a meeting of the meeting and get "busy" with the elite in a wonderful set. Finally the Israelites leaving and Flavia are punished as a traitor of Christianity in a more brutal place of evil ... \ t and the removal of the strokes, and the foot of the foot of the leg, the weakness of respect - including the front side, and the good news as well. I will say that it is the type requested for several points, but it is not enough to get really tired. I would recommend this one for fans to use nunsploit / 70 ... 8/10
