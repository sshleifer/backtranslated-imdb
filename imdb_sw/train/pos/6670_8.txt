There are many problems with Men's Secrets. First of all there are so many characters that they all get interesting or even interesting features. Special effects prevent the story and not very specific. Paul Reubens has lost in the role of anxiety, the youth as a character who only loves and speaks for a wonderful odor. Now find a good place. William H Macy, the third words of heaven, and his performance as a shoveler is perfect. Sphinx is a unique strange character which is very strange and only eliminates the traditional mystical proverb. Ben Stiller is very amusing too, showing a weak character trying to make it into a great superheroes league. All actors are doing, and that's the place I've found something unusual. That is because all actors are Indie film actors trying to make it on Hollywood's great leagues. Being honest, the reason I thought failed in the box office is that the US does not 'get an irony. In all I liked the film, but I felt it would have worked well if many attempts were put on the tweaking script instead of having a theme and CGI's unneccesary results.
