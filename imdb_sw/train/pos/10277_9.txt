This is almost perfect film. Thoughts could be repeated by Mamet, but they did not say so effectively. This is true about the failures of honesty, humanity. The film takes into account the fact that we are criminals, no innocent person. What? Is there anyone living today who has not seen this play in our society, every day? The film is very much like Hitchcock's excitement. Besides, there are no innocent characters. The world has now been completely destroyed, destroyed by everyone participating in con. What? Is there anything true? <br /> <br /> Don't miss the sound. It's amazing.
