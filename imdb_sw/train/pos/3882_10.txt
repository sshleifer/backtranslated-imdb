I looked at this tape, once again turning it back, I watched it again and laughing twice. I strongly recommend this tape for those who do not hate, but concern around producers. It shows that transvestitism is a feature, rather than a man's life. Comedy is not a single issue. This person is a brilliant. All communities should aspire to their level of intelligence, intelligence and talent.
