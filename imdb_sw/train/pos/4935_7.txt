New Orleans, an illegal migrator feels sick and left the game of poker while defeating the blackie criminal (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his people Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), who were killed by Blackie and his body in the sea. During autopsy, a family member, Lieutenant Colonel Dr Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service finds that the dead person had a pneumonic plague that comes from the mouse and needs to find who has any kind of contact The person in the forty-hour hours to avoid the catastrophe. City Mayor gives Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) worried to help Dr. Clint find the killers who have been infected with the beat and beat. The “fear in the street” provides a simple story, but it is still very effective and a great villain. The devotional plan has not been fifty-seven years. Jack Palance makes a defamatory mistake at its beginning, and the camera function when trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very interesting. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Pânico nas Ruas" ("Fear in Street")
