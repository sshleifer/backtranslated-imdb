It is interesting that P.J. Soles was not a great star after playing Riff Randall, fan # 1 of the punk rock Ramones group, in the "Rock" n 'Roll High School ". Soles are so happy, you don't know he is so old yet he is still in secondary school (the fact is being done by having all children seem 24). The movie is a fast-paced frolic that does not cop-out; everything is clapping with smithereens at the end, and that's just as appropriate. Mary Woronov, the presence of kinky and funny as the head of Nazi, gets a little, one of the kind at the beginning where Frisbees jumps close to danger and his head (how many are using it, or was it fluke?) And Dey Young is very attractive as the Soles, Kate Rambeau. The weakest, large enough, in this "High School" is Ramones. He can't act, it's not funny, and their part of the festival goes too long. Ramones song, "I want You Welcome", is recognized as fantasy and sent properly; Other popular songs are good, especially rare Paul McCartney ballad when he heard near the beginning ("Are We Meet Before?"). Great fun! *** from ****
