Yokai Monsters: Battle War (Yokai daisenso, 2005) movie about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "creation" logic. Also known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> Yokai's first phase includes teapot freak, kappa water imp, brepa living, a woman who sheeks can grow very big, a woman with a second face behind her head, a gray-gray priest great-like, and so on. These types of modern monsters are not only due to the fairy lease, but from the type of summer entertainment of Tokugawa, compared to today's Halloween haunted houses, or "the show freak "old but only freaks freaks. Spirit beings and gold and playing one-on-one were beaten to form a "cold" during heat. The fatcheek woman was also returned to the method or deception, based on the monsters shown in middle books; & as their structure for the film is simple and hoky, this makes it the most representative of what historically modified for summer. These most fascinating monsters should confront and destroy the former David of Babylon's vampire who has come to Japan and hid himself as a samurai master. Although some of the Japanese exhibitions are less, and much more clothes than masks without even moving lips as they say, they are all very fun and very interesting. It has a good movie, the amount that would be given on the CGI film the same decade. Looks in good condition or with good friends, it's exciting, moving & touching. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also led Lone Wolf & Cub popular: Heaven's white and hell (1974) & was a special FX director of the best trilogy of alwaysjin. Yokai Monsters series are not the same as Majin for the best, but Yokai is happy yet. The first movie of the mike that belongs to the most children of his family films, as well as GOZU & IZOO series much more though there is not too much for a small audience.
