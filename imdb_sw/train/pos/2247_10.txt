I am disappointed with the lack of publications on this amazing and effective film. Jordi Mollà, perhaps more known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's "Blow" Writes, leads, and stars. <br /> <br /> I don't give any plot points, like a movie (at least for me) was very exciting without knowing anything about it. If you have a netflix account, or you have access to a video store that could carry ... I strongly recommend it. It is the creation of things, fun, and sometimes very stimulating. <br /> <br /> Mollà's direction is * quite awesome and shows many promises. <br /> <br /> unpredictable, with amazing pictures and the best performance of speaking spoke in Spanish good "No somos nadie" (God is on Air) is an amazing film that you can show to your friends. IT / IT YOURSELF ON IT.
