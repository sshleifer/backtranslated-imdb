Okay, first fix it on the tag set on the main page of this film. Abe Lincoln did not walk with her sister in the movie, nor did she leave her sister's grave. One person in question is Ann Rutledge who was very close to Lincoln in her New Salem days. Some say that Ann was, in fact, a lover of Lincoln, but there is no evidence to support. <br /> <br /> Now, there are innovations and fictionalizations in this film. Hollywood has always taken a big license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is not an exception. However, the court trial on the film depends on the fact of the fact: charges of murder against William "Duff" Armstrong, and even though they are largely fictionalized in this film with many names change, it will still have a riveted audience for screens. That is the Golden Age of Hollywood, and it plays very well, and Henry Fonda provides the best Lincoln best played with anyone.
