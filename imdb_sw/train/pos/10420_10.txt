Caruso Head shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He demonstrates great potential to work and is in the top form as a festive singer, who was associated with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I am trying to say that he is making more songs than Caruso (see A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). Art and music of MG also did well. This movie can be perfect, is not for an invisible presence of Ann Blyth; we see that he tries best, wearing five-year style in the pre-1920s - without forgiveness. Lanza was eligible for a leading woman, and Blyth should be connected to a small production. Also note that Mrs Kirsten sings most of the opera film films and Lanza, giving an improper idea that Caruso had a soprano permanent type.
