"The Garden of God" was one of the first aspects of the first element, the Technicolor 3-strip film. In order to fix the original poster The first part of Technicolor (after the special Disney age of 5 years) was 1935 of "Becky Sharp" which was a game of clothing that used color for garish color. "The Garden of God" seems like it could be shot many years after watching movies not only color but also the use of shadows. It must be amazing for the audience to see the color of the color after seeing only the black and white film for their whole life. Unfortunately, the film does not stand on the movie. What it said, the film should be seen as being treated by seeing.
