The only comments on New Orleans causes ... "than maybe the South accent could hear in that part of the country." There was another opinion on this line from an English inspector. <br /> <br /> Many people New Orleans performs, in fact, the voice "broklynese". I didn't know why. (Written in the "Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole.) I always enjoy the movies that have been made in New Orleans that include these details, like this. It is often just the Hollywood version of the standard South Standard.
