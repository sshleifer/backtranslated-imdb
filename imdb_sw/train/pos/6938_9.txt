For the viewer who comes on it long after doing, "Winchester '73" has something similar to "Casablanca." When you look, you get this feeling that you are looking at the string of the clichés they have often met in that kind; then you realize that the clichés have been only clichés after being copied from this special film, and that they missed too much because this film was very good. In other words, it is a seminar. <br /> <br /> "Winchester "73" is fun to watch. A brief plot of conspiracy can be predictable, but especially because you have seen them often borrowed from future movies, and yet it still has a number of failures that surprise you. Talk, guide to pacing and Mann is the best. Stewart shines exactly, and if you're a fan this is a "must-see," but not alone in providing good performance. Surprisingly, most of the concerns and / or lines of magic go in small letters. For this reason these characters (more) than paper cutting, have given more authenticity of the film. This is an amazing film caused, and it is worth keeping an eye. The DVD also has an interview with Stewart which provides background on the film.
