This is a good movie on the shade house in the fishing village, which can be well described by the streams of the area and the direction of the former Kurosawa acts, as well as the Dostoyevski topic of human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), the game Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen sad and happy. Screenplay is amazing, events are color-and beautiful scenes to stay really printed in my mind. The plan is amazing and unpredictable - each of the characters is made well and attractive - there are also small steps, so if you don't like all the feelings you can also achieve your costs -. It is not about the mysterious and arrogant Syria of Sushirai and their Bushido expelling them all out, but about life, work and kind of people found everywhere at any time. Good and interesting desires for Kurosawa, certainly has value to see.
