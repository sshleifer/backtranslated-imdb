These days Spielberg's "The Color Purple" remembers more for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning the zinc. What's more awesome is that Spielberg himself was not even appointed to the Best Director. Of course, the filmmakers had to be more happy than they were given. This story involves the trials and suffering of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African and American woman led first and her concerns. father and then to her husband's head. The film spends several years and focuses on Celie's relationship with women around her. It is said from a woman's perspective but does not need to fear that it is a 'chick flick'. The story is exciting, full of humor, though the central character competition is important. Some may not appreciate the change of voice towards the end of the film but I didn't mind even though the content contained in a small film would have me to be awake. The film received three Oscar appointments: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Player), Oprah Winfrey (Executive Assistant) and Margaret Avery (Executive Assistant). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were worthy and Danny Glover was not very strong. As mentioned earlier, Spielberg did not receive the best CEO for his efforts. Such a lack of praying for faith, since the direction of Spielberg here is over-notch. I am not very mad about Quincy Jones's score but not less than in any way. At the end, the story is satisfactory, well told by the film producer from Pulitzer. Try and probably be as stressed as I am about how it can be very bad to be treated at night Oscar.
