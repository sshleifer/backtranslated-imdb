This is Warner Brothers's hard-boiling film that looks at Barbara Stanwyck very little. The powerful Lord of the Machiavellian winter show, after a decade later in the "Double Indemnity" of Billy Wilder, Stanwyck has the power of Lily, a well-developed daughter of a strong shade owner in a wealthy metal city. It has been proud and lost for years of release as a private sex to his father's customers. Once his father dies in an explosion of residue, he travels to a freight train to New York and actually sleeps through a corporate bank. This would be facing being ready because it was not the sharpest of Stanwyck work here. Along with his eyesight and hostile tendencies, it is easy to see why human men for his aggressive behavior. One of the young cheaters is John Wayne who is interested in all things, journalist Jimmy McCoy. Melodirama gets a great burden on the third part of the film and suicide suicide, hush-hush work in Paris to keep Lily quiet and new bank president who is very old to Lily that obliges company funds to protect her luxury. End of the end is frustrating but not before Stanwyck sees the screen. The film is curious as Lily's relationship with an African and American woman named Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy about the importance of avoiding feelings.
