I did not feel that this film was as clever as it seemed to think it was but it hated yet. It is the original, although it reminded me of two other French films, Vidocq and the Lost City, especially for the color but also for the quality of adgy of the characters. Keep it in prison but do not let this stop you, this film seems to be more advanced than many blockbusters in the area. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with 'Black Art' permanently well with good and very good quality make just some reliable! Scary for some of this year it is worth looking at.
