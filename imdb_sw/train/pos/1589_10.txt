I love this show. I watch every day even though I have seen all of them as at each other's time. It is about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), living in New York. Holly is going to live with Val when their father was transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, has a partner with a perfect home of Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems Vall and Holly are experiencing. The main problem is boys but it is also about having a decision and another life decision. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and it's free-free spirit when Val is the perfect opposite. She is a layout she needs to have a plan to do anything for someone. The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren, and Tina.
