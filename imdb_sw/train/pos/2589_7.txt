Brothers who have psychological authority (yes, in fact) deserve not only by the show of Debra Winger but in fact the secret from their childhood who left them to vary on their authority. <br /> <br /> There is a surreal touch (brigade fire that will act like a chorus of Greek singing), but there is also humor, wit and romance. Sound sound is also good. And the same way the US Werewolf in London spent every great song of Wolf who could get ~ but by fire and I don't think I will ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), and put his own rockin 'trailer' and 'She's' woman' ;) <br /> <br /> The best line did not exist with part of the qutw 'quotes' Once you have a clown, it never comes back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I just ordered a DVD from the United States) and as a written comment by a variety of people who would be happy with Legally Blond 3 not to put off ~ to give a try :)
