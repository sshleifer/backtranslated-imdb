If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a hard movie to watch, at least in its second half. It is in that place that we see a beautiful baby being beaten and then the lost person (debate) has lost the end after witnessing this wrong act against the child. It's not a good material. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and acting is good, too. The story will stay with you for a while. <br /> "Dominick" is a disabled boy and plays with Tom Hulce. I think this may be the best role of Hulce ever. He looks at a med student, "Eugene," played by Ray Liotta, who was starred next year by "Field of Dreams" of Kevin Costner. <br /> <br /> Dominick is a good man of garbage who reads "Hulk" comic books and likes to fight. She is a kind of "slow" guy that you can't help but love to rooted to live a happy life. When he is free, it is for several good reasons and ... well, look at the film for the whole story. It is worth your time but be ready to walk in the emotional speed and the most likely to be disappointed with the things you see.
