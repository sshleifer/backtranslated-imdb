"Lady in Swala (1999)" with the Gene Wilder star is a good game of mystery that reminds me of the old black-and-white Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and "Cash" put me to the end. There were many suspects because of the murder, but I had no idea of ​​the behavior that would be. Gene Wilder has a special beauty on it, even in its face and fingers with sound it is perfect in part that. The parts of the movie that were shown to the work were done very well. I am sure this is an additional challenge for cast to pull. It's not surprising to see that he made some text for the movie. Even his singing was fun. I love him in this role more than his former "silent" roles as "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope A & E will continue this series. They should call it a "Mystery of A & E Gene Wilder." <br /> <br /> Music is relevant at the time. I enjoyed a cool combo living with flying tunes. I had little knowledge at the beginning if we were seeing flashback or if the action was taking place then. And I disagree that the inclusion of impurities is important for the flow of the script. For me, it always loses. Overall, my wife and I were very happy this second at the start of what we hope to be many others - like one of many other things: Raymond Perry Mason's Burr.
