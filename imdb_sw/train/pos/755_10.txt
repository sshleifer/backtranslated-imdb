Sanchez dirty is very bad, the British version of Jackass which four boys (Pastor, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go to a good height to hurt and abuse. The reason this shows is better than Jackass is because most of the stunts are not programs that makes the reaction more funny. There are 3 series of show, the first follows closely and explores their long life for example. there are parts on their love life, work etc.. The second series sends boys to try different tasks. Three thirds follow their European tour. It seems that boys are getting more and more like they like the show continues through the series. In my opinion the third series is better, but I must rely on when I say, if you have an abnormal abdominal week, if you are difficult to see the amount of blood and puke in each section.
