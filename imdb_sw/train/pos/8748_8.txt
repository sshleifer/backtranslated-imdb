I think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! or Damn Australia? I still don't know, but what I know is that I loved this movie but it can't be my favorite film! <br /> <br /> Good stories with many actors but at the end of the horrible ... To grow up and say 'Oh, he's good' ... However, who did? What happened? Who is the boy? There is no answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> A fantastic film with a good overall score ... I offer 8/10, and continue 8.5!
