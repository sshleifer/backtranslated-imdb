Release helps a lot to make this a good surprise and cut on the common-person-woman-saying-all-time-but-wind-over-love kind of Hollywood screwball romance / comedy. I often go to that kind of film and the respiratory story but this was fun, fun to watch, and it adds to the charm. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are playing each other better and making the most beautiful couple. The best help is best - from the highly favored Felix Bressart to Joseph Schildkraut. Frank Morgan also has one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen doing his job. He takes the film and turns it into a different mood for some time when something big happens to him. That "moving" is another reason this film comes from others of its kind. Once again, when the film has a good mix of groups, it usually works. This is a good example of that. In this film, it is romance, comedy and game and it's good. I'll take this over again "You Got Mail," any day. There is no comparison.
