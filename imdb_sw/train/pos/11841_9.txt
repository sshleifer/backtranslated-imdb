This was a great movie with good news. My children (10, 7, 5, and 4) all liked this movie, including me. Music was also amazing. No, horses don't speak, but instead, the news is told by the Spirit. And to hear the story told by the horse of the horse if the views were happy. <br /> <br /> I think the head says it all, "spirit". This movie gives you the feeling of family and home with friends. I would like to say my 4-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl were touched by this film, and even got it, they laughed hard, and were happy at the end. Enjoy the “Spirit” with your family and give your spirit to this heart story. Your children will love it. I think you too.
