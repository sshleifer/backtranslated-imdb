While the 'special effects' and the technical features of this film can be delicious to others, I have never deleted this picture of a movie set in my small and fascinating mind when I first saw it around 8 years old. The experiment that he endured has been with me all these years, and I have thought again about one incident about how the girl did the situation far beyond what I saw. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was just a child when I first noticed this could be the reason for my high rating of this movie. Every time this film was released on television in 70 and 80 years I would be interested in television, drinking in every area and mind that I cannot express. I think this look for the first time as an adult (and with a jaded view of the world) you may not be happy with others. In fact I have left my way to get a copy to show this film to my son. This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are fascinated by the amazing live stories, it is part of Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, I believe I am enjoying this film as I enjoyed 30 years ago.
