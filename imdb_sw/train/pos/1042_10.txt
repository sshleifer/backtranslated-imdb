American woman, her European husband and children back home to her mother "Watch on the Rhine," a 1943 film to play with Lillian Hellman, and speaking to Paul Lukas (who I believe is repeating his role of action here), Bette Davis , Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. Fascist's assistant, an employee in the underground movement, was often injured, and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs long-term vacation on the wealth of his wealthy son-in-law. But he feels that there is no real escape if one of the guests of the house (Coulouris) assures himself as his true identity and more than the intention of selling him. The best performances are full of this film, written very much to give the view of Lillian Hellman's freedom. It was indeed a powerful propaganda car when it was released, as the war of war and what happens to people in other countries to come to the safer US homes. The biggest dispute of today's film is that Paul Lukas won Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." Humphrey Bogart was a very strange mirror with a wonderful Rick, but Lukas is more like Kurt. Monologue has a need to kill is to make bowels, just to mention one event. Although this is not what one thinks as Bette Davis film, he gives good performance here as a loyal and loving wife of Kurt, Sara. His work of heart, and the love of the love between Kurt and Sarah is good and tender. The last half of the film was tears and the feeling of emotion. Lillian Hellman is not a cup of everyone's tea, but as opposed to "Few dirt," has written other sympathetic, amazing characters and beautiful stories presented by the manufacture and production values ​​for Warner Brothers. It is highly recommended.
