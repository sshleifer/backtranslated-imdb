I agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza, s was the best sound of the voice that he had to give if only he could get the courage to go to leave the Hollywood and head for the opera could become American Caruso everyone says he could be but in any case it was an amazing introduction to the form the art is no skeleton on it and if it is the way it will be. see the film you will see why Mr. Lanza is still coming into the debate even at my home. Someone says Pavarotti says MARIO LANZA. For the film itself when it will be on the DVD should be restored and VHS is not good but this should also be the only film of Lanza that sets the other DVD is very bad and boring.
