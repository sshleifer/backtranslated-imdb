This was the first of Panahi's films that I saw, I saw at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was completely identified by the different characters that he is building and how they are doing and comparing themselves with the children of Aussie and even to another level as well. I think maybe as many people can see movies like this, they can see people as individuals and avoid racism which can often be done with fear of unknown. There is a great political difference between the culture of the Oz and Iranian culture, but I have seen a more subtle difference between the characters, that this film opens successfully on the screen, very interesting. There are idiosyncrasies in characters who seem to me, so it's special. I saw it made the characters compel to watch.
