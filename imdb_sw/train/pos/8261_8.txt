Anger and ignorance but it undoubtedly affects, a man with a male-supporter, in this case as the German and French people were forced to close after the Great War from the new border, leading to the German side, as the French are older. But when the fire starts on the French side, the usual skills of German men lead to help, safety and even friendship. This was a prayer that would fall through the ears of the deaf in a decade, if someone from Pabst's side would break this piece and turn the Great War into an introduction only. But it is clear to me that Pabst believes in fact or at least wants to trust this kind of basic humanity, as this film finds and hopes this much more effective, the romance of The Threepenny Opera did not have a bite to do the job. Also to strengthen his faith of trust is the fact that the characters here are not the priority words for the position, but the real people, and the real families that the home life we ​​know too. These are ordinary people, who work only to believe that they have the value of caring and treating the right of a fellow person, and in this day of humanity, I will take a little crush on my plot to get a good message representing the attitude I think we might desire. <br /> (Note: It seems that the end has been cut off from many buttons, where the French builds the mining door, re-closing people. The brutal change of events, and it might make the film a better film, but I could cry on top of the last sequence, so for a short time, I am glad it was closed.)
