I love the stories of the soul in general, but I am a PURPLE, the weather and the air of the best of British times. This graduates on all accounts. The young lawyer ("mentor" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the sea to stay the property of an old man, late. It was the 1920s, when Brits in the middle went to sea on vacation to "their health." In fact, I think what, there is nothing to "health" about the village of Crythin Gifford, an enraged site of hulking of an old woman, the owner of Victorian castles, which is in the fragments of the grass-made grass. When a lawyer saves the life of a little girl (no one of the local people will really help endanger - you know why later in the film), of course, it brings the fury of pride, a black woman. He is not a film, a vein of color, but a solid silhouette of evil and evil. The viewer sees him only a few times, but you feel his pride in every chapter. If the camera comes in to the lawyer when passing through the legal papers, you expect to see that black woman at any time. When a lawyer comes out of the selected generator to turn the electricity into a beautiful old house, the camera's snakes in it and you think he'll come there, too. Waiting for the black woman to show is nails-bitingly suspenseful. We have seen many features of this story before (an enlarged room that no one comes in, fog, alien who ignores local warnings) but the director can connect them all to a new and powerful new spirit. The story. Watch with your friends so that you can have someone warm to put her when she is chasing a black woman. . .
