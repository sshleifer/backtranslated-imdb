Let me be the first Australian to comment on this :) I got a film of Hugo Weaving and I watched it to the end. It is one of the "life-style" films, as my mother was calling a movie that shows real life stories and no extraordinary events and which are more details. <br /> <br /> I loved light and girls. Some had many mistakes, but without many attributes. I looked for something like an interview, or at least a feature of the villain matrix here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The story teaches one on how to deal with one's own destiny and stop free from the circumstances that others build on you, but this happens when the life of giving a peach factory in the area is close to closure, so it is not a lot of effort to change things needed. <br /> <br /> "smart" America's beautiful sound sounds the same voice back can be part of a great soundtrack, but only one play regularly became annoying after 100 minutes of film. In the end, I think he did his job of presenting part of Australia's life, but for me it does not appear particularly Australia (it can be placed anywhere) and it doesn't seem to be interesting as a story.
