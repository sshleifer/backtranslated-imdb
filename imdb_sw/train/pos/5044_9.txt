Bill Paxton's star and leads this original film. After watching the first time I was how good it was. The review I heard was right. As a result I had the most common expectations. However because of the best Paxtons to lead and act the film is good to watch, especially if you are a fanatic fan film.The movie also helped with the plot twists which continue to come until the mortgage closure. The most powerful films are the stories that I say are natural and are as I have seen before. You have also done well for 2 young people who lead the most actively if these boys were confused. I give this film 9/10 and I strongly recommend that everyone takes it.
