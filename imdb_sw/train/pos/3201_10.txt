This is the first film "Pilot" to hit the Canadian TV Show Trailer Park Boys. It was played by administrators in a few networks before Showcase decided to sign for a tv series. The great act of casting and casting makes one of the best films of worship. The film's plan is that these young criminals move around "destroying" pets for money. If you have a dog that follows a dog that drives all night, they are going! But they get into trouble when they meet with a very big job to deal with them and end up on bullets. Watch this film if you want to understand the beginning of the television series. I recommend so much! <br /> <br /> Rated for swearing, abuse, and drug abuse. <br /> <br /> Its not too angry (don't really show animals to kill)
