If the three boys in their wind-white blows with a dude in a twine or a girl saying "What's up, dog?" for the nose of the road, there is nothing to please everyone in Knuckleface Jones. It is wonderful and surreal and not quite a comprehensive yarn ... it has never lost it. The first time I saw it, I laughed and played. And every night after I come home and look again. Forget Coyote Ugly ... this is a movie that strengthened my crush on Piper Perabo. Check out ... before the delay!
