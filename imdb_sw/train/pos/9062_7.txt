it's the weekend I watched this beautiful film. and I love it. All children are cute, who remind me of my own childhood and stupid thoughts. is a real movie for the family group during the night of the week, which can make many memories and laughter. Kid's humor always works. good to do also. A simple story but a cool shot. A good job for the guide to find the way to the child. when it comes to a movie kid, I think of "12 and hold". another year but the situation different from the world of the child, which is real and brutal. A wonderful job. H2EFW focuses on the joy of childhood, each child and family needs. p.s. Reading, I think, is Nemo's voice from "Getting Nemo".
