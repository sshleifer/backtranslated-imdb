This is probably one of the worst movies made. It's ... awesome. But it's very good! Perhaps it is better if you do not destroy the anticipated plot and something good and arrogant, because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to look at it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro / English hair bad, you are really cured. The more you think about the film, the worse it becomes, unless you have a tournament to see a lot of holes / toes, where you don't have entertainment hours ahead. I would just like to recommend this film to bored fans or fans of dying. And yet, the latter must be careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a bit angry about it, thought he was selling himself out. (It was not true, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was an executive producer) can do it for him).
