I cried my heart, watching this movie. I have never suffered from any eating disorder, but I think this must be a very real picture. Alison Lohman is the best! He expresses these feelings in amazingly well. My teenage years returned to me very clearly. Anyone who has gone through a difficult time as a child or boy will be able to share this film. I recommend you all to see! <br /> <br /> Music is too great - I've now discovered Diana Lorden. I also enjoy seeing Alison Lohman in White Oleander, because I am positive she is perfectly suited to the role as Agnes.
