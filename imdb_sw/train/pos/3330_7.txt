I wasn't just extra in this film, I had to see it in Boston for the sale of movies. More than a thousand thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans appeared themselves in cinema movies around Boston Usually looking comedy .... on them .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and stars Jimmy Fallon is this beautiful comedy about love and passion. Love is among two young lovers. Greed is the red Market to win the world series. Although Fallon is not a good actor, he is the best actor. She is funny enough and gets more laugh. Barrymore on the other hand is Barrymore who was old. Sometimes, I felt the helper Ione Skye would be the best actor for that role. All, all fans of Boston Red Sox will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
