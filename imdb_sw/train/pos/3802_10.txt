Dragon hunters must be the best animation I ever seen. It was a jaw-stop. Movies are about a couple of rogues in search of money, their dog weird furry blue that hot fire, and a girl who dreamed about being a knight, and they sent on an effort to go until the end of the world to kill the world player, a very big dragon. But honestly, it doesn't even matter what the film is about. Because, it is a good-sand. The influences in this dream world are different, so the architectural and spatial blocks of the earth revolve around the churches and houses and the same villages, and there are lily forestry. The world is very creative, so it is unique, and the kind of story book is used. The world looks like a set of beautiful painting. Monsters are visually beautiful, as a fire dragon included with the red donkeys. Some of the conspiracy are not the first, as the main actors who want their Panya and Men's field and do not seem to be able to do it in the world; but very good graphics, some cases of destruction, and emotional discussion makes this film interesting.
