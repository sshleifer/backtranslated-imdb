For those who were willing to know exactly how humanity was found in the large red podules that made me love the pomegranate, there is a "Second Renaissance" cup. I don't know why they are divided into two parts, especially because they are known as one on a DVD (and are these shorter versions in any other format but DVD?), But it is reported even if they have few restrictions. What makes this first part visible, from the second part and all the other exhibitions, is a reflection of the robot rebellion and civil rights. Photo instructions for slavery, fascism, concentration camps, and many monuments are incorporated with the words of Million Man in March and the God-complex human. In fact, "God" has never been mentioned by these shorts, instead replaced by "Photos of man". <br /> <br /> Apart from the cap goes to the collection, "Second Renaissance: Part I" is more effective in bringing emotions. It is a sad and horrible view of the possibility of humanity being a "architect of its own destruction." Some may extinguish with some of these short-term concepts outside the original science fiction books, but again, that is exactly what the series of Matrix has done, and has been the driving force behind its success. <Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
