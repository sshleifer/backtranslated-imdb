... maybe the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). instead of one fan of a fan service for fan girls (well, that was great ~), it was a story that struck me off. Desire for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know other people will not agree with me on this, but it was not one of the three major actors (boys who played Sho, son, and Kei) who gave the best performance (to me, however). was Taro Yamamoto, the boy # 5 from the Royale battle! It is not available to me, I like Hyde, I adore his voice, but the problem is that some of its events came a little 'away', but I loved the area where he played the male body who died to kill other boys. and Gackt was not too bad, I loved how his behavior was normal from the beginning. nothing can say about my history on Lee-Hom Wang, I do not know him, but he carries his weight and cast stars. This movie set one of the best partnerships I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if appropriate). when the full song is about nine minutes, you can't see the length because you would enjoy hearing Gackt and Hyde together. However, this movie is a must-not only for fans (a fan base) but for those who enjoy sci-fi, future movies, Asian style.
