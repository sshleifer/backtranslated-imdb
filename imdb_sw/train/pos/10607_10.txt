Henry Thomas was "chief". His character had my mind. I was "in" a story that I forgot that was not true. I wanted to protect the child and see who was a special person. Other people in the story were important in the makeup of his character. The way they put together to help each other was truly amazing. I like movies that show the real sense of human emotions without knocking on the head, because you can't be able to do it yourself.
