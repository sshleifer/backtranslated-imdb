"Red Rock West" was far away from one of the worst fans of over 90 years and superb script (with John and Rick Dahl) that enabled you to focus around and around your seat for multiple films. It was highlighted by John Dahl and shows a wonderful cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in memorable performance) and making it a riveting and captivating thriller not miss. The movie has never had a great broadcast on release (in fact I got the first on TV) and so it is one of the smaller gems that you should find but this unique film now gets the following worship. > <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who has broken up and the workout when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. He was lost by a killer named Lyle from Dallas who was shocked to have been given $ 10,000 to kill the wife of Wayne Brown (J. T. Walsh better). He is playing with the plan and decides to go and warn Brown Suzanne's wife (Lara Flynn Boyle) but then the conspiracy is widespread and there are many problems, turns and surprising - and two operations - Cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds itself in a very serious situation. he can not isolate himself! Then just disturbing things even more Lyle real returns to make a contract killing (played by everyone favorite heavy Dennis Hopper). When the hopper sees what happened he goes after Cage but no one can see the incredible events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some of the most popular lines from the film: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (by Lara Flynn Boyle): "I like to see a innocent woman hurt but it's a lot of money." <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (by Cage): "Michael Williams .. Well, Michael, you're going to spend a little time with us until we reach the bottom of this." <br /> <br /> Boyle (for Cage): "You're not a killer?". Cage: "That's all right, no. But the boy should enter the city so you can get from here". <br /> <br /> Boyle (for Cage): "Well how are you going to describe a typical killer hired and take $ 10,000 from my husband?". It is a little exciting little (just 98 minutes) and a story story that will not help you with the power that works with all principals. Any movie featuring J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of the best. It is a tragedy that this work of exceptional actors was cut off by damage because of heart attacks in 1998. The more "film film" had no doubts for forty years but "Red Rock West" is a good example of The latest and emerged on my "Top Ten" list of all the favorite movies all the time. I expect more like this from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts <br /> <br />
