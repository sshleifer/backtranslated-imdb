This is one of the movies that are appropriate every time you see it. It is filled with many natural and unusual ideas that always find new details. As in later Sabu movies (I have not seen a "unlucky monkey" yet, but others are better) failure, space and humanity performs great responsibilities. Cutting and Montage is an innovation and skill, without a movie to be a photo of "art", but very entertaining. When you compare to "Run, Lola, Run" you should remember that "Dangan Ranna" took place several years before and was shown on the German TV earlier in 1997 ... so it is more likely that it was like the movie's Tom Tykwer Movie, and not the way The other around. In addition to other comments I add that I love acting and finishing. This film is a lot of fun in many ways, and will be able to send messages without being angry or engaging.
