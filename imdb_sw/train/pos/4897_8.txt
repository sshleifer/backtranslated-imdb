This film expels you from getting-going because it takes our attention to accept, yes, that this story opens with a cliché? funeral. In other hands except Judi I could not give them 8 if this material was done on a regular basis: Reconnecting once popular, select one to please, team, army army, reminder team, singers, band. But this film is not enough for cheap, and when you think it is going to go to the other side. The case is a flower that is used by the pastor for Judi. Band members are an interesting group and climbs on clichés too. One is in jail, one has found a religion, one is alkie, and one has gone into a mental trouble. But joie de vivre found again by Judi, beaten by the interests of her grandson, carries us and makes us look at a very simple time of conspiracy. Who is talented, Leslie Caron, Rao's jazz who is not comparable with his amazing top notes, the last performance from Joan Sims, Brava Joan, who is like a love Ian button Holm with a ball, and Olimia Dukakis with a divorce living in Scotland mountains ghillie and its whiskey, the closure is the standard of Hollywoodland, the children of star sentences were converted to supporters of love, former supporters met again, the youth entered on old music. Life must be simple. But I will look at it again, with a desire to have my own grandson. With the right hands, sometimes someone likes only these old brass clichés. 8 out of 10.
