"Nonsense bit now and then, is loved by the wise people." <br /> <br /> If you are very smart to watch this film, then you are very smart to be alive. An incredible deficit, a good Force, a piece of time that was done with an acute eye. Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just amazing! <br /> <br /> Buy it, sit down, relax, enter, a little smile. Enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Then, thank you.
