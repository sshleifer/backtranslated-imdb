It seems to be a full day of swimming. The average family seeks to gain from them and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is bound under a miner or his wife or a young son can help him out of this - while the wave is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes a car with a search for help. John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) is powerful because of questions without answers. Stanwyck finds a young man who could help, but there is a price he pays for this. There is a double question of possible movie. What? Would you like to go to help someone you love, and on the other hand - looking at Stanwyck's behavior to a stranger - he loves her husband? As a good short story this film leaves the viewer with questions can answer himself.
