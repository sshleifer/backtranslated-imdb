_Participant is a fantastic story of Jean-Pierre Marielle waiting for a cup of hot water, a story of conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose work is slightly lower than they were, but a strange tribute to French actors and their movies . Help and reflect on the movies and act (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, play or not play), the story of this film that many of the most famous actors play their own role (not confused and live their lives in front of the camera - the film is not a vour), and it follows the characters in a series of events that makes the film very interesting. If Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and causes Josiane Balasko to play his part (a good actor, he is very bad at the time, in the role of Dussolier, he locks himself), as actors run each other on the road, begging for autographs, like fights and rumors occur , we recognize the pastiche of other events that each (or others) played. True, for anyone who does not know the characters (most of them at least in 50s) or do not know the French Cinema, this film has a low interest, as many records have missed, but they will still provide a good song to reflect on aging, by acting, in public life ...
