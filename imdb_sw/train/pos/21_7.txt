This may not be the most memorable, but it is a love-related theme that emphasizes the importance of reading and learning in the modern society and the negative effects of work and life for any unfortunate person. > This story refers to almost Iris, a widow who deals with a colleague in her factory work, a illiterate worker named Stanley. Iris knows that Stanley can't read, and after losing his job, he gives him a home reading home at home. Of course, as you can predict, the two, although at the beginning are afraid to participate, develop their feelings for each other ... Jane Fonda effectively plays Iris, a woman with her own problems, dealing with unemployment expectations, two young children (one pregnant) a sister who is unemployed with her fierce husband. However, Robert DeNiro is true in his brilliant talent for the intellectual and intelligent, but he does not know to read, Stanley, to bring honor to the role which commands respect. They are not your usual new yuppie spouses, as shown in screenshots, but the standard working class, the middle-age pair and the good fight of the world. <br /> <br /> I will not give you a far end, but it's a good romance, interesting and looking for an individual in a problem of illiteracy, as well as a perception of false behavior.
