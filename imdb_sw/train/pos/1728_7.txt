Wooden park was one of the first "escape" stories from World War II, telling a true story of Eric Williams and other survivors from Stalag-Lufft III on October 1943. I love this film, but it's on VHS from Amazon The United Kingdom and the relocation of PAL in the United States I read the book when I was in high school, after seeing a film in the early 60's on the TV The drum of Peter and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is more truthful than a trip to the trips shown in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure, which should be made more for the American audience.
