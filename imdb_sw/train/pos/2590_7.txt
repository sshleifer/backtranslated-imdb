People who are a bit of this film are those who do not understand the movie start. These are people who love the movie blockbusters and they are opposed to any movie that is not recommended star Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a thin film that can seem strange and maybe even wrapped up for the first time, but what does not exist in the plot, it is more than the creation of substances. One thing especially about the movie I was very interested in is the use of music, which has a great place. Those film music students will see how important music plays in the film, in the life of Vida and Wilder, and behind. The Wilder theme, the Vida theme, and the Wallace theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some of the lyrics play. For example, in the area where men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida has Wilder when men sing something like "She's my girl", and then goes to Wallace to give her something when men sing lyric "She will be my girl" with a cleverly showing tension between two brothers There are all kinds of little problems like this into the movie, and when it may seem like flop out, the real student film will see how good this movie is true.
