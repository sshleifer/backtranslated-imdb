This movie depends on the art of Frank Frazetta, a model of fantasy of fantasy. Some of the characters are similar to his painting (the Death Dealer is a better example). Surprisingly, the animation can put a sense of original art. Bakshi is known for its extensive use of rotoscope (a method of tracking the sequence of live action) and this film is not different. However, since the subject of the movie is true (all the characters are human), this works well. But what I like here is a plot: once we have a story with interesting characters and a good practice, a really hideous villain and a good child. This movie has the feeling of the best comics, it is not surprising since Roy Thomas is the author of the Wonderful Series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from the condom action of the crappy, not talking to all the B's movies. It really was recommended!
