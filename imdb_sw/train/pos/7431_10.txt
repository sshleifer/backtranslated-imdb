I've been very happy with the movie. It was my favorite movie all the time of 1976. There was 70 years old, I had love with Kris Kristoffersons looking and trends, of course not a critic of the film, but for the time period, I think it was very good. I very much like the Streisand combo and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well. I have seen the film many times and I still love two like Esther and John Norman. I am a great fan of Kris and see him at the concert when I can. It is the author of a talented singer, without reference, actor. I have seen him in many movies, but still think back to the star is Born.
