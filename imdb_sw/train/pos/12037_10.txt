Woman In Black was the UK held for TV movies that was the first to announce on BBC on Christmave Eve's '89, and again in '92. I believe it has made it all around the US TV on A & E. It was released from the VHS in England early 90 years but it was not released. U.S. Company was released on the DVD later, but the version also purchased. According to the author's website, the rights of movie owned by another person and that they will not be reproduced, and that there is an informal bootlegs sold on ebay. I first heard about this film recently on the message board and I had to look at it. I got a copy on ebay for about 28 28. It is indeed fake from the seller in the east east, although the DVD says, "made Canada," ha ha. But it is a good copy, and you can not completely destroy the bootleg literature by providing a few items, printed, and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a piece of the period set in the 1920s, with all the true and very good British systems at that time. Woman In Black is a very dark atmosphere. For the most part, the movie is very important, but fit and scary. There is no defense for the year, violence or much at all in special effects, but Woman In Black can still create a time when it is completely up to. It is a film of a fascinating and colorful spirit. The movie itself looks like it can be made in the 1930s except for color. Without all the flash of modern movie screens, I am afraid of this film always just being a lost gem. For me, she puts herself as one of all my favorites at all times.
