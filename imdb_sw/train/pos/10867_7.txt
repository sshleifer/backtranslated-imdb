I saw in the guide of the film list for the Santa Barbara film, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this film was in the investigation. Basically there is a choice for the new chairman of Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society to come, so you can imagine how much violence will take place at this time. The struggle is between the "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for the control of the former and most powerful Triad part of society. Also star Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as General Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some realistic topics of corruption and time, only on enough steps, apart from perhaps when the fighters are involved, but the followers follow, so it is a very interesting crime crime. Very nice!
