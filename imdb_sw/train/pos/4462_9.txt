One of the best music, Anchors Aweigh has several memorable music programs, like Kelly playing with a mouse Jerry, Kelly playing with Sharon McManus 7 years old, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson singing and Iturbi doing, and much more. Technicolor is perfect, and the work of creative cameras such as the piano saw it played from the bottom, through the transparency keys, and singing to Grayson, seen through the camera of other cameras. The program is narrow, but is involved with Kelly & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailor at the time of departure, they should take the boy who fled (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls to his aunt. In order to take her to Aunt Grayson, Kelly shows that Sinatra can take her to an inquiry with Jose Iturbi. But the young Sinatra and madness in this one, and in his singing words fall in love very quickly. While trying to communicate with Iturbi, who has never been found, he begins to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but now Kelly loves love with Grayson. Aweigh Anchors often remember for a combination of life-action / cartoon with Tom and Jerry, but there is much more here worth looking at. I have given nine stars because, while it's not as good as the best music - Singin 'In The Rain, The Man of Music, Oklahoma - is one of the first class of Technicolor production (perhaps Meet With In St. Louis was the first), and the best than many others.
