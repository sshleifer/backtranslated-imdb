This year is 1896.Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people. There is only one friend and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), a kind old man. important to them for wealth. In Skagway faced trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes a cow. Now Jeff just has to return and drive through the Canadian border to Dawson. Now they have a group of others like Ronda Castle (Ruth Rumi) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). Two men enter the gold trade. Anthony Mann's partnership with James Stewart, the Far Far Country (1954) is the real west, in fact. The work of the acting is very good. Major Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman appear in small responsibilities. It's amazing to look at how Jimmy Stewart won al l problems in his way. There is only one with his gun. But also he is dangerous.
