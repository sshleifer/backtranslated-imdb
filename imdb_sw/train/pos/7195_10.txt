I liked this serial republic! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even complicated, the quality of the image was not the best, but it's okay. Installation of this serial is also bad, but not bad. They should only practice more. As I said the story is great! You are sitting there and waiting to know who Don Del Oro is! Music theme is the best! It is one person who makes music for the Walt Disney la Zorro version, who is a slave of the Fightin Legion music. Dress and buildings are very beautiful. Zorro is very cool and so are the locals! I highly recommend this serial. Buy! I love Reed Hadley plays Zorro! She is funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
