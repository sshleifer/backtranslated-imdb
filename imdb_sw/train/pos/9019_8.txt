Not want * to give anything away here, I would just say this excellent reviews, without treating and strengthening a little flic will charge the viewer and at best and half of entertainment: It will be amuse, surprise, possibly constant shy and almost certainly tug with a constant heart, while approaching inevitable, but not clear, ending without becoming a clich√©d or predictable in any way. Certainly it was proposed. The original User Reviews provide 8 out of 10 for 10 films and 10 out of 10 for the best performances of Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I fully agree.
