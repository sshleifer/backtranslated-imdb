This is one of the best crime videos during the 1990s. Pacino was good; he had to be chosen for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't care about his Louuu-siana feelings. He can come as angry if you can't stand this language. The way the behavior of Pacino interacted with Cusack's behavior was reliable, surprising, and slightly sometimes. Danny Aiello was as good as always. David Paymer was the principal in the role of helping. Bridget Fonda was good but not remembered. There were times when this picture was described by many characters, perhaps very many. Can take a second observation to remember, "which is Zapatti does?" After many cross references, one needs to stop and think just to repeat. The latter was not too hard. It was built for a long time and then it was a bit of stop. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the film was not released as a "big, blockbuster" big hit screen, it has made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were good but the lack of film "burst" in the cinema may have no number of appointments. It was half of the success in the home market, and the audience still learn that this name is out there. It was held in 1996, it still stands today and will continue to be popular for many years to come. So, put the lemon pudding (see) and see this film!
