This film is a fun, fun and high-quality film. The film follows carefully the guidelines as a book, and tries to cling to real lines. All actors are suitable, and you would expect them to be part. They use popular actors who have a great impact on the film. Images are a little dodgy in a certain place, and there are quite a few errors in the film. There is no such thing as the Red Street Virus, for example. The camp is not as bad as described in this book, and it does not show camping events such as the book. His whole group has been told much in the book, but not on the film. In general, a great film of daylight
