The matter of Life and Death, what can you say that you will surely do justice to the beauty and beauty of this film? Visual Powell and Pressburger ideas don't know limits, each frame is filled with amazing songs. The change between the boldness of the "true world" and the black and white colors of heaven is highly skilled, it shows us clearly how the best life is. The last part of the court is also extraordinary, as the judge and jury descended to heaven to hold the court on the work of Peter (David Niven). All videos are spot on (Roger Livesey being a stand), and the romantic energy of the film is good, has never been more romantic than this (if I'm 't see). The question of Life and Death is about the power of love and how important life is. And the film show of Jack Cardiff is enough reason to watch the film alone, the way to make the face of Kim Hunter makes it more beautiful, what skills, can make things as simple as a tennis game table look exciting. And the sound structure is also impossible; The way in which the voice decomposes in important matters was the way of the decision before its time <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can restore anyone's confidence in the movie, less addressed on its original release and by audience today, but one of my favorites at all, is why I give this film 10/10, for word - Good.
