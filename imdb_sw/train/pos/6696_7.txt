when I first start watching these have been one of my favorite displays. Until Melissa Joan is very interesting and talented so are the nobles and other characters and the stars of the show show cat, she was very big. The first small season in my opinion was the best when Sabrina was a young boy in high school turning a magic life. they were the most funniest, most entertaining and many um ... good. I wasn't a fan of time began to introduce Brad and Dreamer because I totally liked Valerie, but they were the same trouble they were just in it for one season. if you will have new people at least put them. I didn't like Josh was t * t, I liked Harvey but then lost. and they removed Libby! it would have been surprising if your would have been attacked in seven years. and Mr. Device also, if he and Zelda were married that would be gold! then Sabrina comes home from her mother and home to Roxie / Miles / Morgan. I didn't like these people, and they didn't like Sabrina. Sabrina appeared to lose its beauty and objects and aunt seem to have avoided out of her life and that they are lines of stupid stories. I am kind of stop looking for the time and the former refugees again were back and I was like whoo-hoo! LOL. I must say a few last moments were quite horrible. They removed the aunt who played because they were a big part of the show. then suddenly allows those two freeloaders to enter into good houses when they treated him as dirt. and now she works in a newspaper shop so that they can keep the visitors of common visitors in the show, if in every part it is a kind of destruction. The deal fell completely and lost its luster. I saw the last part. had a aunt in it (Zelda decreased with a candle) and she is almost married but runs the last Harvey. I would like to know what happened next. well that my evaluation and the only thing I can say is the only thing that remained for myself through seven years was Salem cat.
