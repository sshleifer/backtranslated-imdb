The best movie about two lovers love the woman. One of the soldiers (Périer) killed him, but all the evidence appears to be worse (Montand). Montand unlucky does not know who the other partner could kill, and Périer does not know whether Montand was connected with a girl. Montand should get quite a killer ... and what a great end! It is highly recommended.
