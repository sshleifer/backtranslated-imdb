The ride with the devil led by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another role in this beautiful cap of directors. For those unknown to the history of the Kansas-Missouri border war during the US civil war. Watch this film and you will visit the sad piece of Americana. In addition to some of the most favorable events (at all bloody). This is a story of love and commitment among men and one particular woman. It's star Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright & as Jewell woman, I've never heard or seen him before, I want to see him more). Acting is a high summary, good quality production, well-written novels! <br /> <br /> This is a 128-minute film, but it's good to see. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br />
