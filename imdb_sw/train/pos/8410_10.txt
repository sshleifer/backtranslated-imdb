In this fascinating, dark-colored film, a young student who fails to take her soul to the devil for a lot of money, to return the devil takes her glass (this has been done carefully in the movie and eerily when Balduin, the student is early to practice the sword in front of the glass ), the image of the image for "the person who fights with himself" which shows his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman who loves it cannot be found (has made a contract with the devil, cut off forever from the love and other riches of the soul) you may have love or you can change your soul for money, you can't have all. Balduin is a haunted and double it (journalists show this for the beauty as it did. Some celebrations are wonderful, the meaning of punishment when the Devil disappears and the mirror of Balduin is amazing, as well as that his contract has rejected him forever away and the human society (where he runs away twice and ends up in 'destruction' along the city, no longer human being (he lost his soul) he is like an animal out of human society There are many other things to say about of this amazing film Paul Wegener was a wonderful actor and director, my hero hero. Help if you know a little about the German history when this film was made and about the German doppelganger culture (not google, find the right book) Just remember, it's a very early film, it's a very short time, but based on what it says and the end of horrible, it's one of the best (yes!)!
