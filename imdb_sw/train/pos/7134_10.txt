John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was attracted to her attitude in the role of adult adult curmudgeon who agrees to accept taking in evacuee from the London streets (WWII era). It is said, the film is also excellent. Very interesting story and a satisfying end. Some characters are very poor (especially school teacher), but none of them are important for the plot. Basically, the story is about an old man and a boy, and the film requires a little something.
