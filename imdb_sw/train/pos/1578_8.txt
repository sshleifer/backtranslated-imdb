Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in trouble. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish men are imprisoned and transferred to exile. An elder who was beaten by his family, Lena Fischer, finds himself among the group as the Gudarian sister. But the title and preference do not require special attention. There is no service for Reich as male detention that her husband is in the Line Line will learn. In one of the most frightening scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band presented by her husband soldiers. Do not think this is an example of the German brutality we have in America today to have Lady Bush for the brutality of the arrest of the gold gold mother (the American member of the US family members were killed by step) because there exist for them now there is offencive. Little, sadly, has changed over the past 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. Fortunately, eight-year-old Ruth avoids catching. <br /> <br /> Waiting cool on Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer was the first reluctant to take Ruth to answer in a way that we take as usual German. Even the brother of Lena Fisher Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach who knows and protests Holocost warns against Lena. but Lena chooses to accept the idea and the American rebellion even to name the name Ruth, the name of Aryan more than the name of Helga Lehmann. It is the ultimate end for Rosenstrasse but Lena laments: What happened to Ruth after the war? Some years later Ruth's daughter, Hannah, tries to find her old mother and meet 90-year-old under the personal history of the war. I saw that it was amazing that Hannah wanted to look at the family but never examined the fate of her last grandfather known to serve on the Ostfront.
