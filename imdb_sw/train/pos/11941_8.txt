They are not Cary Grant's journalists and Rosalind Russell from "Friday Girl" or a trustworthy investigator William Powell and Sassy Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are very surprised at the assassination of an amateur at Scoop. Their screwball brilliance is fewer than after the crisis of depression, writing to Allen filled with an independent and old New York angst deficiency. Shades of old wit occurs rarely, such as he, like Sid, Chief Splendini witch, responds to his history: "I was born in Hebrew faithfulness, but when I older I turned to narcissism." Johansson, clean from the Match of Allen Match as a bad girl, here gets to be good, sometimes a journalist who was found in the secret of a suitable killing for London: a serial killer. The program is a renewal of its recent match of London's match, under the high sin and "American Disaster" / Location in the "crash" of the sea. In fact, Allen does renew Manhattan Murder Mystery and Rose Purple's Cairo with just a few other names. I don't care if he does the renewal; I would like the new material to be at least equal to nature, and, alas, it's just to reflect its little magnitude. <br /> <br /> Allen as the director and actor cannot hide his love for the actor, if he could not by Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a comedy in the right place under the canon Allen, not great but amusing, sometimes brilliantly satirical: About the top-class defendant, the killer Sid (Allen) quips, "I would be very surprised if he killed one person." This is the humor of Allen's harvest. Although there are strictly restricted texts like most of his films, he gives Scoop and music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky, and Strauss let us know that Woodman has not lost his touch to the class.
