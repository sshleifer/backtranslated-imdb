A twenty-five-year-old invader, Antione Fisher (Derek Luke) has been sent to three sessions for evaluation by the navy doctor Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after a burst and other repression against the supreme navy. To give the start of treatment, gets confidence in Dr. Davenport explains his childhood, revealing pain in his home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they love each other. To solve his personal problems, Anton becomes a new person. This true family picture is a touching and positive story of someone who finds a friend and is restored to normal life. Denzel Washington's focus is best, makes it sensitive, interesting and with good taste, stories about child abuse. In the hands of another director, it can be a very heavy story. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando Viver' ('Back to Live')
