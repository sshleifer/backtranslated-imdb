I saw this for a few expectations and I really liked it! Bend as Beckham is an ordinary movie of coming-age about the right girl atypical. This is the responsibility of speaking to Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a young man in England who finds among his traditional Indian family and his love of football (that's football for us in North America). And though he is much older than his character, he plays a perfect-perfect place. This is a movie about friendship - especially a friend of Jess and Jules (Keira Knightley), a team member who is also going through family issues, especially his mother, who is wearing nail purple nail with little arrows on his shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear a rabbit underwear and play with boys and is afraid that playing games means her daughter is a female partner. Jules and Jess both love to play the game and have the issues to try to convince their families to stop going after their dreams. Also, unfortunately, two love one person - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). A love triangle is caused by friendship. In other places, Bend It Like Beckham falls on the clich√©s. For others, events come out very long, and this film would probably benefit from general editing. But this was an enjoyable film about growing, fighting culture, and soccer love. It's about empowering women, monitoring your dreams, and helping your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is a small film that can ... and it did. Idea. 8/10.
