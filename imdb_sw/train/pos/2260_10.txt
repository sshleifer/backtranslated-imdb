DAMN GOOD MOVIE! One that faces a lot. Songs that children sing in the movies give them a sense of pain, but also their future hope. Whoopi Goldberg puts good performance here, but the best performance in the whole movie is that of the actor who has a title character. I would have been in the most movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a maximum. I offer 10/10.
