Recently I bought this film with a group of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Normally, I am in battle with the act of movies but I often like romantic drama. If you are inspired by the exclusive FX films of today and the top romantic comedies you should look at the Corner Around Corner Evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have very good. There is nothing fake or feel about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: When he gets to know that his wife is lying to him and one of his employees tries to beat himself. Not only because of shame but because he had no right to Stewart's behavior. (Okay, example of fatigue.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the purpose of the movie is thin and predictable plot. However, I loved it very much. If you like Notting Hill then you will be like Shop near the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
