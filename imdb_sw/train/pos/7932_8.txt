When I look at a small budget film I know what to expect. I expect to do not good (budget reasons), I expect the lights are not good (budget reasons) I expect the voice will not be good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like a great budget budget! I am a filmmaker and so I understand budget constraints on a small budget. Cuba sites, shots etc ... list continues and continue. I don't want to say that all acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza is good. Raul Martinez is natural. Not sold at Carl Washington yet. He should understand that every line is not important, others give us verses. I say if the film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good film. I loved this film. I gave him 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great work of Quiroz brother!
