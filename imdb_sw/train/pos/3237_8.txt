Following my Finnish experience for a little more than a week, I would say this movie shows the situation of Finnish society accurately. Particularly the role of a couple-and-child-to-be-known problem for me, as I saw what happened when I was in Finland. The relationships and problems of the people, the weakness of the marriage institution, the culture of drinking, unemployment and the problem of rising financing, are all well-placed, without concern or spread. <br /> <br /> There are some points in the film that are not easy to understand and integrate, but the big picture together is profitable. Not every one of the short stories is exciting or deep, but as mentioned above, the big picture does not fail to give the impression of "real life" and impress the viewer. I am thinking about a quiet time: What happens in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, this is what happens. Movies like this is good to feed your thinking ability. It would be safe to assume this film could apply to life in many countries, but it shows exactly Finland as it is, and very good. <br /> <br /> One comment on acting: Be a fan of Finnish Style I have never seen any of these actors in any film, but I have been acting in this feature the second most general. Maybe not a jewel, but a very good effort to all employees. I will look at the future efforts of the director and cast. ../> <br /> 7,5 / 10
