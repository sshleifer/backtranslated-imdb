To be honest, I didn't like this film when I got it for the first time. But I think the problem is that I haven't seen it in the theater. Great Errors! Because something # # to see in Cliffhanger is settings and # 2 is a movie. Try to see this film on the big TV as possible and the loud sound system. Music is good and puts the film on top (and commercial capacity). The more I see, the more I like it. It is one of the best movies of Renny Harlin. This person knows about the action. Die Hard 2, a good long kiss, etc. And it is very good in this film. Special effects are great and interesting. Stallone was very much needed the movie to turn to success. It's still nice to see him!
