I would like to think that if Steve McQueen knew he would continue to be the icon and start "You want: He died" the same year this film came out, or being in The Seven Magnificent two years later, he didn't want to do that. But it did, and we are rich for it. <br /> <br /> Certainly it's a classic camp. Fear in a way that was meant to be in the theater. It's fun and nostalgic. It's amazing that the last lines of the film were: Lieutenant Dave: At least we have left it. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic stays cool. They could not think 52 years ago that the Arctic would make up. Blob will return soon.
