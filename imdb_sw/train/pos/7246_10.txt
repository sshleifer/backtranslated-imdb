This movie is completely ridiculous. It's not just an emotional plot, but acting is awesome. Specific effects are limited to the entire movie installed in the desert after the state. However, it is a long-time popular movie given permission to release. It is 101 minutes to laugh due to the fact that we all know that there is no oil in the year 3000, or any El Camino. There are also other things that I will not win, just because it makes the movies so amazing moronic. I strongly recommend this film, because of its absolute idiocy. I have no idea who will look at this expectation to be a top feature, but if good laughter is what you need, see Exterminators of 3000 Year!
