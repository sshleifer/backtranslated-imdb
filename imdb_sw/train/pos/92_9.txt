This is not a film of art, it is a common entertainment. Lot of good people, t & a, and action. I found it very entertaining. Should not be mentally stimulating, it is an enjoyable film to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just gravy. Indeed the value of the lease. <br /> <br /> So for summary, I would like to recommend looking for a little Friday night entertainment with boys or even your girl (if he likes to see other girls get it!) Vinnie, Corey Great, hatian guy from Heroes. Very criminals.
