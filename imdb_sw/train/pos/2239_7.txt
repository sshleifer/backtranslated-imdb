I think this film will only work for people who were all exhausted by the great hype of the Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. And so I love this movie. Especially I love all flawless superheroes from LotR to be so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied. Many more are Gandalf's (clever and wise and clever hero): Almghandi, fear and brain transvestite dead. Sauron ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) wearing only a bucket with eye holes as a hat. Aragorns convert ego is still another planned idiot accident who tries to fix its broken sword ("Ulrike" story) with a watch tape. And "Strunzdumm" (colleague of Wormtong) actually has a similarity to Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
