I enjoyed this film and watched it twice and that's something to say about the document. Music results, movies and sound are quite stunning as you can expect from Imax production. Even though it is a shot for these great Imax movies, it looks and looks amazing on my home system. In fact this can make a full DVD to your demo system. The lesson is also very interesting. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was a fan of Mario because he is the best player in history since he is the only person to win the Championship Championship, F1 Championship, Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The script tracks the way of two very important cars and father. The first car is found in chicken chicken and it is the first road that Mario has ever run and we are raising you back to perfection. Another car is Michael's new car and we are looking for cutting the mold through the tournament season. Imax offers only the magic of justice to make the car enjoyable and interesting. Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti team when the film was held, tells the film. Anecdotes and its witticism, derived from many years as the owner and driver, provides a large amount of production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the running events. Put the sound here! There is something about running together for more than 200 mph and a color logo that attracts you completely on the screen for infinite experience. Wow! The last magical feature is the humanity of the Andretti family. God of the racing world, Mario Andretti, who loves the father who is involved in the work of his son. They work together so well that every father and child should see this. You can tell them that they are a close family. I would like to have all the experience.
