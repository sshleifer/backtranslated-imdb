Always enjoy the great act of Drew Barrymore and his great performance in this film, where he plays gal, very small, Holly Gooding, "Skipped Parts", 2000, who comes from New York to travel to California and share an apartment with a top and coming correspondent, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Band", '96. Many amazing things begin to happen to Holly and she wants to find her brother in the intellectual center after killing her father. If you look closely you will see Drew Barrymore's mother in real life like her mother in this picture. If it was not for the good acting Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this film should only be seen on Halloween Night! However, it certainly has a surprise in END !!!!
