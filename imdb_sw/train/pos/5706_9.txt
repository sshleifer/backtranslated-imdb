If this movie has been made a few years later, I would like to hit a mark or two because the sound of the sound was bad. Sometimes, the film has been shown to be a silent movie at mid-screen (normal sounds are missing). But, from 1931 to the French movie, this is completely forgiving. Especially since this also happens in French films later - when the voice problems should be made completely (such as L'Atalante from 1934). Well, with no small voice problems, this is a small film about a winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to find it. And, while searching there are many jaunty songs that you can't help but like. Beautiful film of everything.
