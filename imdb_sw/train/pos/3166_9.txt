This edition has now arrived. The first time everyone was beaten from Eric to Fez, all were new actors and actors, new faces, and just looking what they had done. They clung to the show and it was successful. It is one of the best performances made and probably the funniest sitcom that I have ever seen in my life. It would be sad to see the end but if they finish this show, I hope God that the series of finale comes from one of the hardest moments that any season has ever had. I don't care if the whole season you use because it stores all the fuel for the last part. Go down, get one last horn. The show deserves to be, the fans deserve, if they go, let everyone know its end, like to friends, and let the finale be great. I say Donna and Eric are married, I say Hyde and Kelso are fighting and being friends again, I say there's something interesting happening between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for a long time, but of course it might work for him. FINDA IN THE BIG TIME INDUSTRIES! <br /> That 70s shows always being better in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I would be with you as friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
