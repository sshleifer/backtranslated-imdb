A mix of beautiful black and white pictures and 'Eugene Onegin with a plot of losing' made this a really knock out to me. The atmosphere created by more shots of dark shades and frequent white-white. There was a good time where the transparency - the most common holiday, but where the faces of executives revealed the character and the small but once - it was shown along with Lensky's heart from Opera Tschaikowsky Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> I mark a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by the middle, which means that the story is often smaller than the pictures and the sky - Year Last Marienbad is a good example of the film. Krisana is in the same mold.
