I liked this movie since it first came. I was nine years old, and now I'm 27. I remember playing a video game on Sega Genisis. I was very happy, I would like to show my son this movie. He likes Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie as I did when I was a child. Although he is much younger than I was when I first saw it. I can't wait to appear on DVD! I hope it comes from the DVD! Please let the DVD! I'm dying to see again! Yes, my opinion I hope someday I will see this film again. I love all the videos in this film. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
