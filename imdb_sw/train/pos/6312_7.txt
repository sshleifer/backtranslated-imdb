Before George Clooney described Sam Rockwell in his first beginning of the "Evidence of the Dangerous Mind", they made a star in this film. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they believed the truth in this project. In this capacity it also looks like a good and entertaining project, on the same line as the film-remakes such as "Ocean of Eleven" and "The Italian Job" but somehow this movie is just a bit successful, or at least not as good as it could be. <br /> <br /> Movie all its characters are played by other well-known actors but shame is that the characters do not have enough space to develop. Even though they might have been an enjoyable and enjoyable actors, it is now only the characters who enjoy it because of some of the quirky mechanisms that are in the film. The fact that you are playing is not so much in this regard, though it prevents their characters from becoming a total weight or perhaps even anger, or anything like that. It is true to write that characters are not used for all their abilities. I can only assume that the original Italian movie "I Soliti ignoti" works better than this film does. The movie depends heavily on its simple story and the way to predict the story. <br /> <br /> Yet the movie is still just very fun looking for maybe because of the very simple one. It is an innocent movie of a small movie, which should not be too worried about the story. In the issue "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works and it works well. It is a movie that you will not try to watch once you have finished but also a movie you can easily do without seeing it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
