The high energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933, Bowery puts the owner of the saloon with the Wallace Beery operator against the opponent's collateral and dandy, George Raft, and the roadway adopted by Jackie Cooper and good looking Faye Wray in the roles that play between their great competition . It is not known exactly what all competitions are about, but everyone follows in the daily tabloids. Most of the wisdom at first, but the characters reduce the speed as the film continues. Besides it is the great pleasure of the events in the Beery saloon. The various characters, the line of the sexy club, the importation of the drink, the perfect creation of the cave of evil are not also avoiding the so-called pre-code barriers, then later come to Carrie States led by Carrie Nation yourself. It all creates a very clear picture of life that has gone a long time. I don't like to compare the eras, but this film is quite completely different from anything that can see today. The film has a lot of heart and has long been lost and it is absolutely necessary to see.
