Kazan's first film won Oscar. Some reviews here go with amazing details and lengths about the film and its logo, and weigh it very much. I can almost see where they come from. But I would take a more toned way to a long-forgotten film which seems to have been shot much by no means budget and in the style of text. The symptoms of pneumoniki are lost on New Orleans roads, and are for a military doctor (Widmark) and a detective of the city (Douglas) to catch the main carrier (Palance). The film is a lot, it's black and white, and it uses very well. Widmark is amazing as usual. Forgetting the sign (crime is the same as the disease, and the disease is the same as the crime) and just enjoy the expulsion. It is not very easy to watch a movie like this now that we are well in this new century, just like a certain style that was very short (after WWII through the 1950s) and would likely be useful for a typical film player. For those who will be looking at this for the first time, stay stable for the expulsion at the end. It's something else, and I really don't know how they published some. I can say that it probably took a long finale film as it did 90 percent of the movie.
