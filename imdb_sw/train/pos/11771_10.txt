Great entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful displays with Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many practical events. The movie was made to me! Funny lines in screens, good music. Dalton as a tough sheriff with Railsback as "redneck-villain". I must recommend this film for every practical fan! 10/10
