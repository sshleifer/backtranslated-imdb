All I can say about the series of Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 is ... if you're off "PC" or you don't have a bad feeling of humor, then maybe you will get it. As sick and disgusting as this film is, it's really comedy and not a movie "fear" completely. If you can understand someone who strips the bounds of good taste and the legitimacy of politics to the most severe limits that are possible, to the point where it becomes so out of hand that is comical, then you should see this believe. This movie cannot control that the great film studio can not touch this with a foot of 10 feet (with the last condom). In my opinion however, the best pieces of art come underground. If you hold on to the old form that people are used to see, then they refuse it. <br /> <br /> I've seen terrible bags, boring, z-grade, Indy movies that were just losing the VHS fine tape or DVD-R. I have also seen the difficulty of the bombing of the huge label that was a complete waste of millions of dollars. When a non-BUDGET film from two at Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out and hits all the "shock" films all out of the water, you really have to look for the second time of the Indy movie. After seeing this, you can actually see the independence of the Indy movie partner you can have while struggling themselves. The strange thing is, even some people who saw this movie and "liked" to accept the fact that they laughed all the way. I don't think it is possible for anyone to find the pain of looking at either of these two. So if you take everything that you have seen in the most common media, and they can laugh at an unwanted fake, the puppet that uses psychopath who has finally hit, you should see. You can only see by stand-alone, classic cult that is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 is among the favorite in my collection of over 1000 dvd.
