MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me a sure fan of David Lynch. He is a modern professional, because he is not the only one who made the film. His stories and his style have a spell crossing the screen. Therefore, the victory story was a surprise to me, and its easy to follow stories and sets of sun. Still, Lynch is there, and, this time it is far from his ability, is a film that should not be lost. The performance of Richard Farnsworth later is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
