Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he has died he is free - but he does not know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a ruler who has fled to a monastery to eat more life. They meet an accident in Algiers, falling in love and getting married. But he can't leave his back and can't live without him ... Dietrich and Boyer are struggling to provide good performances but NOBODY can stop some of their line! Still, by the way, it's classic. It's a shot at a good Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where each chapter is breath-taking. Dietrich always wearing 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and hysterical strikes shows the clothes and body. Boyer walks around looking at (no shock there). Yet I was never tired. It was strange to see and the unintentional conversation of the conversation set me for stitches. Finally I had fallen from my seat because I was laughing hard! Now I love romny romances and give them many opportunities but really --- this is amazing! It also runs very short of 80. <br /> <br /> As a classic camp I provide this 8. Like a great movie - 1.
