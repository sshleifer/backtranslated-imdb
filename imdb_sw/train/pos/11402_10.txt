I saw "An American in Paris" on her first release when I was still at school and I liked it so much. I came back to see the next day and I lost the number of times I have seen since, on movies and on television. It makes good use of some of the best music and songs by the most famous twentieth-century composer (George Gershwin) and includes a great male (Gene Kelly) and female players (Leslie Caron) in Hollywood history. Help Oscar Levant (like quirky as ever), Georges Guetary (why didn't he make more movies?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an irresponsible role) is on their form. Closed ballet, very selected by head music, makes the best use of sound sights and sounds of Paris and photo artists and past authors. All Gershwin songs are well set, but which are not memorable are "Very clear" (Caron and Kelly on Seine valleys) and "Nina Rhythm" (Paris kids join Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you like Paris, check out this film. If you have never been to Paris in your life, see. But look!
