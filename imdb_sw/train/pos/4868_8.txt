I paid this film between 8 out of 10, saving 10 for e.g Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge the film without understanding the life of the Balkans, ideas and spirit that Kusturica offers with skill. To understand it you really need to be one of Balance. This is an amazing movie, the most beautiful and most modern of its previous films, which scary this time, I think Kusturica is going ahead with this film. I like humor (the Balkan humor), photography is the art itself, every area is artistic to the limit. Plot is probably the story of the story, you do not remember now, but remember to read to my daughter-go-sleep story the same.
