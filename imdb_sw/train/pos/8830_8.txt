This is a brilliant diagram of the B / W 35mm film. The movie makes you see a wonderful way of starting at 7:35 am in the bar and many things can happen there for 8 minutes. makes sense that something is not at all. It shows a lot, makes your adrenalin more advanced and subtle details, and is easily understood by anyone, not movie critics. But I know how it looks: Europe, black and white with Europe. The budget below. Don't let that fear you. It is very important to see anyone, not just the same kind of experts. It is not more than telling them, since the film takes about 8 minutes (exactly), and I don't want to spoil. But I just looked at the internet and I couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes to send a comment about it. It is really important to watch. 10/10.
