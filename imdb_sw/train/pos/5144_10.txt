This amazing movie is different from anything that happened in the west at that time. With his horrible feelings and the net of visions, dreams, and amazing pictures, its effect is beautiful and non-combining. Pastors are more elected as drums than act. It has a unique dream that I know that it really looks like a real dream (sorry, Dali fans).
