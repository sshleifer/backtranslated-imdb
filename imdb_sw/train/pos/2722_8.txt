The 1959 genocide in Kansas, according to Capote's book, has been shown by Brooks and cinema movies in black and white, making it feel text. There are good displays from Blake and Wilson as killers and Forsythe as soldiers who follow them. The events that lead to the murder, carried out in the real house where crime was done, and the sound of the whistle, are very intense and frightening. Brooks describes many seats and uses several interesting changes between events. The only complaint is that it is more than a long time, and the denouement has been hampered by preaching.
