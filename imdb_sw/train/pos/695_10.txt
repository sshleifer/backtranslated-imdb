This film puts you in and makes you stuck on keeping your eyes on the screen. The author / director is a brilliant and part of the story and the use of creative and interesting corners of cameras and views that all add to the hold will be with you. The Insomniac dream is original and looks exactly like any movie you have seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This Indie will discuss the change and it takes to take through knowledge and understanding. It has eery feel and is dark interpretation of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became insomniac. He is a good actor who is not hard on either! In fact he spared all his life in this role. From the storyline in a way that makes it one of my favorites. I recommend it's highly confident and waiting to see more from the author, creative author / director / cinema movies!
