Two types of professors thought they had been done. Today's Polynesian populations came from the immigrant Asians, migrating from the Far East, the island to the island, east to Tahiti and other tropical islands of the South Pacific for a thousand years. But strong thinking did not fit well with the little Northern Norway Thor Heyerdahl. If these statements were true, how could other people born and born on these islands have traditions, art, and physical characteristics that are not the same as those from Asia, but South America? What? How do the plants of Ecuador, Peru and Chile appear as if you could find thousands of miles on the island? Is it just a coincidence that Muslims describe the sea to South America and say where their fathers came out, led by Tiki, similar to Adam? At the same time, how do Norwegians talk about Scandanavian predecessors who were taken from the South American colonies, and, with some of the indigenous people they had friends, went on the West Sea? It's very much to be angry with Heyerdahl. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of workers, and local skills for a traditional raft building, the journey begins. It is many trips within human imagination as it is a pseudo and scientific exhibition that such a trip is possible only on the basis of tools and river. Oscar-winning Documentary can be dated in its voice by Anglo-ethnocentric technique, but it rises to the spirit of an even better adventure plan of space that launched ten years later, as men already all the risks try to test them to think it is true. Wonderful. Make yourself a permit and read the book first. It is a wonderful page-turner and a perfect set for movie fashion news.
