I have seen a series of Thin Man - Powell and Loy is obviously great, but there is something awesome on Powell's chemistry and Arthur in this flick. Jean Arthur says while watching Powell. There is an unknown density emerging between them. This film can be the magic of a series of Thin Man, but of course builds with charm. As I watched, I really thought Powell was doing something far away from Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is one film where I would like to go back for some time (by moving and closing lips and Powell!) There seems to be no end to his smirks of fun playing! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to "perfect man." Okay, this is a way to shout too, but I can't help myself.
