This is my first comment on the IMD website, and the reason I write is that we're talking about one of the best FILMS! 'Ne goryuy!' it will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if not a fan yet!) and traditional traditional music, and you will probably accept the problems of your own existence and just feel good after watching it :) What I like most about this film is that participants in non-lead roles create clear and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as a central character. The film is approaching Vahtang Kikabidze (who is the principal), but you will remember every single face next to him in the film. You will find yourself excluding their lines, which have been household names for many Russian-speaking people. Movies to live with. Simple, but deep, you want to watch it regularly.
