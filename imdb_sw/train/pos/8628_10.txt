"Der Todingking" - the second film of the full feature of Jorg Buttgereit (the first was notorious "Nekromantik") does not have the main character or characters, but instead continues in the act of suicide. The set, each of which includes the complete demolition of a complete stranger. This, the production values ​​are low and troublesome, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is very good. I make you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment. The other works of Buttgereit are not gory, but there are exciting pictures as a place of healing in Tuesday, corpse corpses and various suicides. The last period (Sunday) is very troubling and full of pain! - amazing if you want my 10 comments between 10-see this after a modern shocker! A mess art in pure form!
