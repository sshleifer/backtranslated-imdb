In fact I love this show! I have loved the 1990's Space Ghost show! This view was hilarious and I can't believe why swimming for an adult Cartoon Network could take a show as amazing as this on air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the cartoons of Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his daily life with his mother and father and his best friend who loves to stop a lot, Zorak! My favorite places are one where Zorak finds this sound of good singing and then his voice does not give any money that Zorak made from singing all the time. Another time that I like is one where Brak and Zorak did not complete their homework and then return from Sunday to Friday and they just go and then return to work at home work and then when they return home work were not available! Another place I like is one of Brak's father and neighboring neighbor, Thundercleese Robot continues to get into these exercises and then eaten by a big bug. Another time I loved it is where Zorak makes the position of violence and then another new person took its position. I also like many other sessions! One thing that doesn't make me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, burst and zapped!
