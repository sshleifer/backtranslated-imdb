I do not know where the Iranian directors get the impulse to come up with a plot like this. In fact, it is a very simple plot that many directors can come up with --- but they may not be able to insert it into films such as Jafar Panahi did. The film is like 2 creatures around the same time, one is connected to the other - the match of the football and the war between developing sex behind the walls of the field. It makes you feel like you are on a film and you are one of the characters, and while watching the film, if you would also see a football match. You will feel the same excitement and feeling like those female actors in the movie. It comes in a way that you want to see the end, you will need to get judgment, you will know what will happen to girls. I would like a middle conversation between a smoking girl and one of a military participant. It is like a VS mars, it really shows the difference in thinking of men and women and women's struggle to get equal rights and opportunities especially in society very patriarchal like Iran. This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi which I have seen (first to be the Golden Crimson) and I look forward to looking more. I've already been danced with Iranian movies and this is a must-see!
