I enjoyed this film very much. Most Korean people will feel comfortable with this film because many of them have servants when they are at school. The average movie was average. The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more common. Editing, however, was very good and unusual. <br /> <br /> Acting was also very good. Kim Ha Neul often played the innocent girl, weak in the soap opera of Korea. But this time, he plays very well. Kwon Sang Woo also has a very reliable role. I love so much about this film, the feeling of characters is not so much available. There is a lot of Moran romance movies that the audience eats the river before the audience and I always thought it was very stunning. There was no such trick in this film. Very beautiful and well done.
