It is a form of madness, but I beat it from both TCM, the German version of MGM "Anna Christie", and one English ... but I found this first, 'I would like to hear that many people thought it was better than the English version. . <br /> <br /> Without seeing another, I can't compare them, but so this is the best talkie early, and direct performance from Garbo's heart. She looks very beautiful in this film, her face shines, especially when Cameraman William Daniels, gets its beautiful. The film's movie looks different from the typical MGM elements made over the time, it seems to be similar to French or German films from thirty years, and was led by French general director, Mr. Jacques Feyder, who led Garbo in 1929 in "Kiss". Theoo would be the best and gives the best performance as Anna's partner, hard-boiled, tough, ship, who is just a child in the human body. Also Hans Junkermann offers a very good performance, like the father of Anna and Salka Viertel as well, as the old floozie of good price. In all experience, because it is the only film that you can listen to Garbo speaking in foreign language ... 'cos film all that he did in Sweden or Germany, was during the Era of silence. <br /> <br /> Great Flick.
