Although it is not anger as a forerunner of tribal worship (ZOMBI 2) I really like this better. This is because of the speed of the speed, the best settings, and the sound of the coolest sound of 80. It has stepped up and has the effects of the fall of Lucio Fulci. Zombies don't seem as bad as ZOMBI 2 but still look good. It was done very well but it definitely has a part of cheesiness; for example some zombies go slowly while others are as fast as ninjas. others are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects stability when it comes to Italian fear? There is even a zombie head! How rad is that? Surely you must see for gorehounds with zombie fans. I'd probably satisfy many fans of action movies too. Also check Zombi 4.
