The first picture of the movie shows the mountain of the mountain in the early mist of the morning, and my mind is: "This is very good." And it goes on like this: The landscape of animals and animals that are seen as a series of romantic painting, each of them is perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is glass, romantic, beautiful. This may seem absurd and escape, but it resembles the story of the beauty of silence, taking place on the border between life and story, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute. Extreme animation of the film, having a simple, slow, single actor with any special effects, made powerful magic. So, I find that the anger that this stand is presented in the last moments, when suddenly two extra actors (a girl like a woman, and her child) are brought. Another lack is music, which often likes, Hollywood-like, and sometimes it is not good: I could not bring an English song with the glory of the French mountain. I went to the film with my two daughters, but I recommend them to adults as well, because they enjoy this kind of film. Obviously, not everyone does.
