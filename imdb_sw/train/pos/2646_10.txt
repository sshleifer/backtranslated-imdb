I think most of the people don't seem to get the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I don't know it's a movie about the abuse of drugs; The replacement is a movie about the way of thinking of those brave brothers, drugs are harmful, little something. Again, it is not a commercial cinema that you can see every day and if the author wanted, he definitely failed, as many people think it is one of many movies related to drugs. I, however, I think something else is the case. As in many movies that reflect different cultures, the audience usually fully understands a film that reflects their own culture, ie something they have grown up with and they know. This movie is to show what the "intelligent" people often think and what problems they face. The reason they do like this is because they lose their ideas :) They should meet people who do many things and accept these things as they launch a space shuttles every day. They begin to work harder and better than at any time. They feel like I went to work, I did nothing, yet I had the best twice as young people around me were on their projects, what I do now and in my free time. And what's even more boring? While you can begin to predict behavior is not because you are a psychologist, but instead because you have seen this example in the past. Therefore, for them, from one side is a non-challenging task, which is also interesting at times, and from others it begins to think about people's behavior. It is a great recipe for great trouble. And unusual things happen to happen in this situation. They are early who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to think of life in terms of logic (math explains logic), while life is not true, it is absolutely true.
