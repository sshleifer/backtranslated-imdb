This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme that the movie expects to convey. One sentence that continues to come on my mind is that "history describes itself". What life is shown in the film: when people are young, they seem to not understand their parents, themselves; people have an excuse not to take part in their loved ones and their children even late; people should always work hard to support the whole family but they are obliged to reject the craft of their partners; people always change their attitude towards different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their hearts are full of love for their partners; there is nothing more important than people of blood relationship in this world, and even one doesn't care to talk to their people about what they feel under their heart to achieve better understanding among themselves, so that when life ends on a certain day, people don't feel sad or sadness since they put their words and always there is hope â€” a new life. Vendors and actors are wonderful. They have understood the intentions of the director. Charming movie in, to me, the effect of bringing fusion skills and princesses of cheers and tears to the audience.
