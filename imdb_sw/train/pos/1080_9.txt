Modern "comedies" these days are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, the language of evil, and hitting hostage. Modern comedies appeal to the most common denominations, damage and mildness of the brain. Of course, good comedy will always come together, but they are rarer at all. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings Dream House" shows what 1940 Hollywood was capable, and it's just screamingly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in Connecticut's suburbs. The film monitors their story, starting a home hunting trip, an attractive house building, all the way to the house - and "soft water zuzz" of "zuzz". their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as he will look at the cost of the house zoom out of control). However, the film has been stolen by a wise lawyer of Blandings, played in full with Melvyn Douglas. Managing stealing every area where he exists, Douglas is very busy when he looks at the lland blandings from the crisis and the crisis. Reginald Denny as a strong architect of Blandings and Harry Shannon as a good old sandy water is also amazing. I have watched this film often and makes every day laugh. I think it's a good film to look at when you need to lift, whether it's building a house or not.
