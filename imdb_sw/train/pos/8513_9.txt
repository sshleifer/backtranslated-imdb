I've had the philosophy that every man has a different taste, I've seen this movie being awesome and I think every college student out there can agree with me. However, this is not a "conspiracy movie", it is about real boys and some "problems" that they face. I saw a hilarious movie (especially places that played each other's joke). Just put it, if you're in the "wave tide" like these people, you'll get this amazing movie. I don't think that this surpasses any Golden Globes or Oscars, or that people in this movie will be stars of the future, but it is a kind of "cult-classic" among young people who may have experience and experience. For me, a man who stands most is Hans: Scandinavia player, who, according to him "is not a player", but finds all (or some) of chicks. People "small" also play a big part in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I will be able to offer a spoiler and I don't want to do it, just go and get a movie and you can't regret it. I offer 8/10
