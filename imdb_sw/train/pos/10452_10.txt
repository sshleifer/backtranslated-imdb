I want CÃ©line and Jessie going further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they have been interacting with each other, that in a lot of time in the film we want to die for each other. Their story is what we wanted and probably most of us never had been reached. This is about love but not stupid things like in "identifying mountains" or such a kind of film. This is life and I believed them, I believed they had fallen ... This was wise and touching. I have just finished a minute and I am still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. I'm going to say that now I was a bad fool and I felt like love is just a fake, fancy, but for this movie I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow some time, something could happen. <br /> <br /> I am a French and I do not know much about July Delpy in spite of Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... Now I must see him work because he looks like an angel and does a perfect job. I saw "before the fall of the sun" (good in Paris) a few days before seeing "before the sun" and it does not matter. They are all masterpieces. The evidence that you do not need to impress the eyes and technology to get a fresh feeling. Sorry for my English which I try best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
