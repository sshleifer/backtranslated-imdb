I saw this film first 40 years ago on N.Y. TV, and I think I had a respiratory observation next time. Wells sees the restriction of personal independence as a good thing. ("no private flights".) The 30th year with the war in the film is why this film was not shown to British filmmakers. The concept of the future, and the concept of the Korda Co of the future machines are the real stars of the film. The combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from a wonderful series of fabulous. Interesting to note that the personality of a negative Boss is the same as during the Churchill war.
