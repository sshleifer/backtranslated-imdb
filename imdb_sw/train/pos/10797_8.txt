He built, prestigious Carol (well played with beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her beautiful husband Eddie (populist David Houseman), wacky of Carol, always eating the best food Anna Anna (cheerfully witnessed the zeal of being infected by Chris Jordan). , the pastor's husband Pete (Eric Edwards) is a quartet of free swingers who enjoy having regular sex with each other. Their normal work breaks down when Carol was in solitude, was banned, but still enjoys a widowed mother Jennifer (great moving movements with Jennifer Welles). Soon Jennifer opens and becomes an active participant in a romantic and non-resistant lifestyle, and everyone except Carol wants to deceive her. Author / director Joe Sarno concludes a thorough observation, with regard to the understanding of the cities of the cities and the shortcomings of the entire wild'n'easy of the 70; Sarno returns to the traditional middle class on their heads and the fragrance that has a girl and a brave and stimulating girl. Additionally, Sarno makes the first standard of what it does from bang-up: Welles and Brooke both are unique, with great support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as a new sex professional New Age Shandara, and Erica Eaton as a neighbor saucy Mrs Mashamba. However, all women are very hot and trying; Welle especially efficiently evaporates the screens and its very interesting figure and sufficient available presence. Sexual experiences are very good and they describe it fairly, but they will not be happy or terrifying. Stephen Colwell's style of bright, beaten by Jack Justis' bouncy, the mark of the proud people of journalists is all over solid and highly effective. It is recommended to watch for Sarno fans.
