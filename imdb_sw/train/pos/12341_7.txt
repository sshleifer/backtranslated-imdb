Although Lang's version is well known, Borzage's work is not of interest, apart from it: its "heavenly" series is much better.

Borzage's love for its characters shows Marie's love and love more than the grave is one of her favorite lessons (the end of "three friends"). Store seems to be anywhere: we see it even when we are in poor homes of Marie. I do not think that the set is very fun, it is stylized for the error. Right from the nearest distance gives you a sci-fi feel for this movie has never forgotten its social worries: in the train of heaven goes, Rich can't stand up and confused with riffraff but if "judge The chief "says:" here is no different ". It is not a great job for Borzage (not the Lang version), but finding out if you're interested in the main task of the director.
