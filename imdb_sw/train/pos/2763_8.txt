People tend to complain about the number of films made on people with mental disabilities. I don't see this as a legitimate refusal, no more films of too many films about people of any kind. Jaco van Dormael does a good job with a script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne are working together, and Duquenne engages himself. The film covers the vast landscape of events, and not just the content going on what was seen in the "Rain Man". The end is humility rather, but it does not destroy the wonderful story that has come before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
