I did not expect a powerful film "Girlfight" film. It is Indie; The low budget, no executives, the director of freshman. I had heard that it was good, but it's not good. Putting in a modern, tribal, Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama community has done an amazing job of catching the urban days in Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, is angry with the angry and assaulted by high school students, getting into trouble with school and her friends. He is raised by his father alone, who seems to love him and his brother, but uses a large amount, a double-sex gender. The double dose of the father is shown by the fact that Little, brother, is taking boxing lessons in indoor practice, but Diana refuses similar activities. Through practice encounter with Little, Diana is attracted to boxing. Little does not like gloves, so he and Diana business areas; gets money from the father then gives Diana to take lessons in her place. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie to feel good, like Diana grow up and learn about himself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious head issues. There is no giggly, 'everything that can go right goes' the right decision of "Bend It Like Beckham". Personal and private issues are very big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is the best and most satisfying film.
