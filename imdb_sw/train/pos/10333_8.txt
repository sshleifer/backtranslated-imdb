This was a small film of the American propaganda which is very creative and speaks openly to the Nazi enemies before the entire death camp was revealed. By the end of 1944 and in 1945 it would reveal how bad and horrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most cruel film of the era that I have seen about Nazi genocide. The film begins in the courtroom in the future - after the war was completed (the film took place in 1944 - the war ended in May, 1945). In this fraudulent court in the world, the Nazi leader is tested for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unaware of one of one witnesses who reveals the life of Grimm since 1919 in a series of publications. At first, it appears that the film would be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was prompted to join Nazi. However, over time, it becomes very clear that Grimm is a sad monster. These events are so amazing and they really share your interests and also make the film look like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate game. <br /> <br /> For all, the film has a good job to focus on the film especially the second-tier actors. There are many compelling circumstances and exhibitions - especially the Jewish area that destroyed it to the end that cannot help but bring you closer to tears. It was also interesting how close with the same action in the film there were many creative events that use crosses in a way that you may not know at first. In general, it is a must-see for historical lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film. FYI - This does not mean as much criticism of the film, but Hitler was known as "that hanger paper". This is the story of the story that Hitler had made money once put the paper. This is not true - he was once a "starving artist", a homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI. A horrible person, yes, but not a hanger of paper!
