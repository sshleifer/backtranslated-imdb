Okay, I will agree to give it a fantastic film - part of this is due to conspiracy, but I still had great difficulty believing Pierce Brosnan to play this leadership (though he did a very good job). It is based on a true English story that went to live with the Canadian Indians at the beginning of the 20th century. In fact, he was very successful and he was thought that people came from all sides to hear his teachings and to be taken on his desert journeys - though he was not the mixture of India's blood and all his skills were from books or stripped! Film stations on this and what happened when hoax was revealed. Acting and setting was good and I liked this film (once I stopped the unbelief about Brosnan). It did not get a widespread distribution - perhaps because it was a brain - not a Bond film or romance - just an odd film about a wonderful person.
