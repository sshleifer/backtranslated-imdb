I watched this film every chance I got, behind the seventy when it came out of the cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which has attracted me (and Bill Clinton) since then. I was still very young, and the movie made a great impression on me. It was good to see a film about other young girls growing up, trying to decide who they wanted to be, and make good choices as well as good. I was so surprised by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the great clothes that they finally had to wear, and the snappy talk. If the person who raises the mother and one mother, I could recognize the truth with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem to be closer than I Beyonce Knowles!
