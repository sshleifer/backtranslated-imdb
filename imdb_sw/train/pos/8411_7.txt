This original version of the story 'Prague student' was made in Germany in 1913, with the star Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a role of two (an impressive specialist for a 95-year-old film in a single shot) after meeting an old man who makes an agreement with him for gold - gold needs to count the calculation previously saved from the sink. Moving at a fast pace (film runs over an hour) and accurately written and explained, 'Prague student' has described the story of Faust along with Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starting as it does with the contract. The incredible figure of evil, and develop in the beautiful and ugly sides of that man.
