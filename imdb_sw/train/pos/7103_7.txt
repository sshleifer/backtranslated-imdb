I was very surprised with this flick. Even though their budget was clear it is still unacceptable that this film took 7 years to do and it was still good. Acting was very amazing and the story was very interesting to me. My only complaint would be that the end is really very little to my taste. But hey if your audience deserves more attention then this film has succeeded. I would like to recommend anyone in Hollywood to look at Antonella Ríos who is the best Spanish talent (something hard to find these days and all the bad novela on acting). Antonella Ríos is actually a star star.
