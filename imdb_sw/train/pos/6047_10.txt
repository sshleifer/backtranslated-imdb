The most important thing about Withnail & I is that it catches that it's not long left college and life can go either time while with all the other good. Freebird is something for those who probably didn't think about higher education and have gone straight to work at 15/16 years old. I know some dive papers prohibit the knife on this film when it happened in Cinemas but I saw it in a house full of Hailsham and everyone seemed very happy. I grew up in the Dean forest and this took me back to my days of sucking and dope (I had many girls - hate to think what it is now - maybe runs a local council). I have watched it a few times on the DVD and I have already seen a film as an old partner who will live forever as part of my collection (how to love this film and Dambusters - it doesn't seem to somehow) I am really going towards the second half of this film and I think about social images and the locals are done carefully. I like a combination of three leading characters and there is actually a good writing here and for the most recommended lines and I will be able to say it properly distributing. I have tried to get a voice sound, but it's not removed (embarrassed, for it is corker). Someone said it was an early stage game, not quite sure how it worked but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearian / memory tracks that seem to be growing in all the films (also saw Dylan Thomas ref too) and like all the small jewelery, there will always be small things to discover if the last place is coming to the Easyrider if they start the next trip. All in any piece of film (love!)
