35 waste, groove Tube looks very like a real TV today! Exhibition of special laughter (nude games), TV show about drug dealers called shearers, and even 1978 Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke, beer advertising (Butz Beer, not amazing than Bud Bowls), dirty Koko (shade of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase performing humor (1975), before 1975, Saturday night. And from the opening of the opening that you got Groove Tube to the original X level, I still can't hear "Moving Up" to the Mayfield Curtis without thinking of hippies to blow the honey drums. For similar films of the artwork, see TunnelVision, Fried Kentucky Fried, Amazon Women on Mood, Monty Python's Over Fringe, Dynamite Chicken, and Firesign Theater Every You Know is Bad.
