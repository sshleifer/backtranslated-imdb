It never realized that Charles Boyer, (Luis Denard) emerged with Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) in the film as well as enjoyed their work together. Even Peter Lorre, (Contreras) had a role in this film and had a bad luck in his bathroom that led to it. This story deals with the Republican Courier, Luis Denard who visits England during the civil war in Spain and tries to destroy the coal mining deal that will lead to great cultures. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) comes with the help of Luis Denard by taking him and at the same time falling in love with him and then helping him run away from the angry people of the English Mine Workers who threaten his life. The worst person in this film is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Animal and Vano Fingers" which provides excellent performance. Great film of Classic 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
