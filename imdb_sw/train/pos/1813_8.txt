In my case I loved this movie because I found it more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the printed movies that have made me reflect on its themes even after it is finished. It talks about death, revenge and hell in such a way that it gets you like a punch in your face, even reaching a suffering with a series of dreams in the middle of the film action. That's what makes this film very good: the ability, only in Don Bluth (director), playing with people's feelings and making them love or hate behavior without any time. That, and the fact that it has many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that at the end of sad but happy you say "I have something in my eye" to hide others crying. All I have said is just some good points of this movie. For others, you should see yourself in a very popular film. Don Bluth, thank you.
