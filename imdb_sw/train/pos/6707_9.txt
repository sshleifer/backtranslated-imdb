Sometimes I know its true corny ... But acting is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is like cute as a button. I love this many show, and I'm almost embarrassed that I do b / c show has rep. to be really corny, but it makes you feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a very low budget - sometimes the actors are changing and you have to deal with them ... If Sabrina's father is two boys different time of the film ... I mean, they could not just say he was uncle or something? Still, I can't help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a very good couple and Salem is quite hilarious. I certainly recommend it if you are looking for some of the most common and wonderful entertainment ... My period that I like is "Pancake Madness" ... part of HILARI. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not a fan of some season season ... Once you get to university, Morgan joins the group and his talk is painful and not well ... Plus he is bad, so The joke about how he lives only on his beautiful appearance was lost to me ... But I think it was installed in order to have a good eight season and I was sad to see one of my favorite deletions!
