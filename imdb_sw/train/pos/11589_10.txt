Man, I loved this film! Surely this takes me again when I was a child. These are days when teachers still show class shows on reel-to-real and if you were good, they could restore the film slowly so that you could watch it backwards. I still remember one of the opening lines .... "We will say he was his name, and he was an orphan living with his sister so and so in the village." This is a good movie for children and they live like a red balloon. Finally the other Indian boys in the village hold feathers for Tutizema and he becomes an eagle. He lives like he wanted. He gets up to heaven.
