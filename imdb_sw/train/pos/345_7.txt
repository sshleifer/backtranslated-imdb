At first or so of the movie was more to stimulate a little say. However it changed later after Valentine's party. In addition to the perception of the assassination of the killer at the end, the swimming pool was one of the few things that do not remember this movie. The garden area with Kate was shot and so was the last place ('twist'). In these instances, there was a real and exciting concern and the scene of the swimming fire had wonders (slasher ways should be). The original killings are amazingly non-gore.
