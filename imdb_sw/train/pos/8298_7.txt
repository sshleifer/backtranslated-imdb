Better than a typical film made for TV, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with good design (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, before Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a top notion of a known Faustian plot . Urich enjoys always with Lucci very attractive and has a devil over the mother of all women's roles. The version of STEPFORD WIVES and LIVE WOMEN, the movie makes early for its vision of Miltonesque visions and fans of fear without the possibility of having many complaints until bone, maudlin denoument. 7/10
