The Merian Cooper team and Ernest Schoedsack issued a record of 50,000 people Bakhtiari and their animals during the summer migration to winter crops. The basic value of this film today is like a "forgotten people" capsule and how they lived during what we West knew as "twenty-second." The biggest difference cannot be imagined. The rough river and the slopes of the dirty mountain are actually true and the animals are lost under water. In order to ensure that the audience of the time believed that the story occurred, the signature signature certificate is given at the end. The version I saw was an interesting Iranian music that you can stand alone and without a film. After saying all of this, the film could be more valuable to the human historian than the ordinary viewer for the good evening evening. Employees had only enough stock to take shots that had written and no function of the conventional camera-based camera. Western middle names block the experience but it is actually part of the record since they have shown how Hollywood tried to put their natural people in order to be accepted by the audience of that day. Non-working entertainment with the desert police becomes "police ball." Manufacturers continued to do the drama-drama Chang (1927) and King Kong completely commercial (1933). Migration theme is also used in Wind People (1976) and in Himalayas (1999). It is recommended for those who know in advance what they are entering - and then they are recommended for them.
