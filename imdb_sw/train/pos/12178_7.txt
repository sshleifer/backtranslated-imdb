I think this movie got low because it was judged by the worst time. There is a diving joke and a shy area of ​​sowing seeds, but apart from that there is really a short time that has made me cry out loud. Jason Lee does a wonderful comedy of cunning in this movie and Julia Stiles can be pretty pretty funny herself. In addition to this movie emerging as the most romantic comedies, after 40 minutes in it you know how it will continue. (It's better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Similarly, the best movies to watch but certainly not the worst ... Cheers
