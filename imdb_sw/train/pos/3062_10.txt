I saw this film a few months ago on the cable, and it was wonderful. William H Macy is one of my actors, and his performance was just amazing. He cares about his behavior, even when he does something wrong, and Neve Campbell gives a performance which is undoubtedly the best performance I have seen with this year's actress. He is as wonderful as a little wise woman over his years. Donald Sutherland is just as plain as Macy's father, and John Ritter is as good as a fall in the middle of everything happening I liked that this was in the theater because I feel that it is a movie that should have a view with a broad audience. That is a shame, because it is a perfect allot hell that many of the new movies come in the theater now. <br /> <br />
