I have a lot of time for all Columbo films, but this was especially written very well, with a very effective solution. However, my main memory of this is the opening of the center of the film, between Columbo and the killer (I am sorry if I did not remember every detail of this particular). It is a very interesting shape of Columbo which I saw: the view comes from the dark of the cupboard where the victim was killed, and into the upper room, planted by day. Columbo is sitting on the top seat of the hand that stands at the door (with us), taking into account the cup, and almost in the silhouette due to the difference in light. No voice. The camera comes out of the room and towards him. He is deep in meditation, bragging gently on cigarettes, swirls of smoke from a cigarette around it slowly as high as he thinks. Then the conversation begins. Good.
