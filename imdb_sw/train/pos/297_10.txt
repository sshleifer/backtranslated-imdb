I am glad some people enjoyed this film, because I know it doesn't have a great reputation and did not make money in the box office. I thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich leads to the smallest way of touch, cast (especially Coleen Camp) is full with Apple Big Bad has not been seen much better on the film. You've seen the worst movies!
