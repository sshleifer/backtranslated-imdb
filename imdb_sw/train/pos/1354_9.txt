For people interested in business and corporate world, this show is only the best of the best. As one of the former competitors of the show he wrote on his blog about this creative show: People in business eventually had listeners. The whole idea is perfect; having a group of traders fighting against each other in business-related work, setting a good place in the world, New York City. Donald Trump is perfect as a master, although its ego is much greater than the world was infinity. It also makes a lot of concerns about who's hot, which is one of the worst about the show. <br /> <br /> Season 1: A great season in general, the best "normal" season. This season was about the actual business skills. Later in the series is almost closed in the works related to marketing and many ways to keep products. Great and interesting fighters in general, and the most beautiful character ever in this series: Troy. I know I am not the only person who accuses that the world of Trump-where the runaways was hard to be with Amy and Nick to win this job. <br /> <br /> Season 2: Also a great season. Work was still very good, and it had many interesting opponents. Jen M was awesome and should never make it last, IMO. Also, this season had the worst shot (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Horror. In fact, I liked the concept of a smarts book against street smarts, but the cast was so quite horrible (it was that Trump hated the cast too) that the whole season was a catastrophic catastrophe. The second session was the second part (motel repair), and Mr. Brian was expelled, a young man who did not add something bigger than comedy. Season 4: The best season, because of the fascinating and entertaining season this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the general tragedy whose name was Toral). "Welcome to the Board board board" is one of the most common lessons of this show, and ends up running very well to remember. Sadly, I think we've been taken for the end of Randall against Alla. I think Trump was afraid that he would win, and prevent it from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: Boring season with real stuff. Brent was just embarrassed and it just seemed to bring the game. The work was so frightening (how it creates anything to do with business at all?). I think the winner won, but personally I didn't care. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I see why they wanted to try LA as a new show, but looking back was a mistake. New York will always be this place. This season added a lot of things, most of them are horrible (if you lose the sleeping team out of the tent, winning PM continues to be PM, for example). The work was awesome and Trump also chose a bad winner. James deserved, of course. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity Edition. The best season ever. Different rules completely (like the use of rolodexes), but all the fun and entertainment. The main problem is that most of the attackers were not real celebrities, especially women who are not known to me except Omarosa, who is a total disgrace for everything she takes. This seems to be a season of Gene Simmon, but after making a complete fool during the work of Kodak, another man left the shadows: Piers Morgan. No one could control the season as he did. He destroyed his opponents and also met as a very emotional boy (though some unworthy Americans (not all Americans, of course, do not make a mistake) for sadly had no social skills to understand. The way to go to people! <br /> <br /> For fans of this I strongly recommend the UK star star Sir Alan Sugar as boss. In fact, the UK version is much better, and that says something from America (and nature) is actually showing. One thing about the British version is that militants typically behave like respectable people in the boarding room, in contrast to the cheating and common behavior that takes place in the American version.
