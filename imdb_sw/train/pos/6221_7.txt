If this film is better installed, it will be above and the best of Astaire and Rogers. Therefore, it is a good but very long movie for a beautiful bond, namely, Randolph Scott dancing Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (who is Ozzie Nelson's wife for baby boomers). Astaire and Scott are two Navy men. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when he looks like a library library, and after Ginger Rogers has asked his friend (blonde but impossible Lucille Ball) to impress him. At the same time, Astaire tries to take where she and her former boyfriend played. The result is an amazing number of drums, and Astaire and Rogers as a team and also different: "I put My Eggs Every One," "Let Me Go," and "I Want To Lead The Band." Hilliard is sweet but it's a little letargic like Jane obviously turned out a beautiful girl, though she sings her two songs well, "But where?" and "Get You behind me, Satan" - one poster was not concerned with the song, but I love the head. Rogers are bad, and the little Astaire is dynamo. The movie view comes at the end and "Let's see Music and Dance," one of the most beautiful songs written and one of the most brilliant with Rogers and Astaire. In it, causes a pleasant for 30s and fantasy. It is really observed and watched regularly.
