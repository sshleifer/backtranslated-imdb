Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name appears to be the taste of the top movies. This is a good performance as given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. No good people and no bad people. But the system has its inevitable effect on people who think they are running. Not only the performance of Pacino promoting --- the funeral of the deceased child is very powerful â€” the film has a quick, efficient, effective performance that improves good performances without misuse. This great picture of the city's great politics will also provide two hours of watching the best film without abuse. There is murder. There are bad people. But it meets effectively without crossing the line. Movies like this returns my belief in jaded on Hollywood. I'm not awarded several tens. This is not very worthy!
