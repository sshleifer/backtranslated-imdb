This movie is a wonderful movie. Everything about it in my opinion was a high score from acting to leading. I know Mr. Garfield was hated in the 1950s but most of his other films are on video if not DVD. So, why isn't this? A friend wrote to TCM but to have a DVD would be good. In particular, they could tell Marine's historian to talk about the war and if Mr. Schmid's wife or man is still alive can be interviewed. However this is a good movie and I recommend it very much. If given out of hope will not be colorized. Paint paint in my opinion just to destroy the entire effect of the film. The war zone was so true until 1945, the film would go. Mr. Garfield did a good job to show Mr. Schmid. Some pastors may have been tempted to overthrow Mr.Schmid's disability part but I feel that he has found the right. I really hope they come from this film one day of DVD as a tax for the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marine who gave us so much for us in World War.
