I have seen this movie today with my children (a child, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3th anniversary of Roger Ebert's film. After the children's film in the audience was allowed to ask questions to the Director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through the interpreter) told several stories about his life and making a film. <br /> <br /> Every tangents aside, my two children enjoyed this film. Of course, I had to ponder on many of my daughter's passages, but much of the film is obvious. We do not give anything, but the bottom line is that this film is more beautiful than 95% of Hollywood hip (especially film children) out there. <br /> <br /> Cheers. There is a "real" / original king of Masks who can / can make 12 masks once. The actor in a movie taught and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time (then they would cut and change 4 masks).
