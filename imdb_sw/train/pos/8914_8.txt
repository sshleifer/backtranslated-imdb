I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry's market was. I remember all my family is watching the film. I remember a man who shows "Blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. I also would like to share my mother was in the movie. His hair style was similar to Aneta Corsaut and was ill one evening and saw my mother and asked her to sit in a car with Steve Mcqueen for some shot from behind. They paid $ 25.00 and gave him a story to tell him until he died last August. My mother was not a young man and was a few months from the birth of my younger sister.
