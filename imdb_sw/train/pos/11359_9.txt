Citizens X describe a real life story of finding a name for "Ripper Rostov" This popular film shows a long journey taken to try to kill him. The film shows how politics can help the killer continue to rampage for more than 12 years. Jeffrey DeMunn as Pastor Andrei Romanovich. This is the type of film that will inform you and immediately have you on the internet to investigate the real case. This film that should not be. It started to believe in HBO and never had to be presented for my understanding. Great film
