This is the best show! I had an American history teacher in a high school that was like this. There are many "truths" in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl tells them very well, in the impossible way. Mr Wuhl teaches a class of film students but students of history and even the general public will enjoy a magic way that reveals a particular deception in the history of the world and strive to attract them to the minds of his students. The use of live practitioners doing "skits" is also very entertaining. I highly recommend this series for anyone who likes to have a history they learned when the child came down.
