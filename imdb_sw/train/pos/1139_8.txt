There are a few players like this, where almost every line and every character comes closer and free. This is soooo funny! And it has quite a bit of satire there. Sally Field leads the field of real actors and performs a good job, if not complete, and a day of tv-diva day. Sometimes his acting is a little bit higher, but 90% of the time he is an opponent! In the league is Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately has very little to do here). Downey jr can not convince you completely as a player and they have no right at all, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, someone ungrateful. But the star shining here is Cathy Moriarty like Celeste, the true bitch if there ever be one more than one secret mystery (you will see in the ultimate stunning end!). Unfortunately Elisabeth Shue was not found very well in her part. I usually like Mrs. Shue, but here she does as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie. But it is not a destructive thing and for the most part he is at least enough. Otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and conditions, this is a watch comedy at any time on TV or anywhere.
