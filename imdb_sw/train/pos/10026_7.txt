Without Kirsten Miller this project does not require completion. However for the beauty and impressive attraction which is Miss Miller I would undoubtedly recommend. It seemed like other actors played only for its powerful performance. The Wagner's attempt to respect this film was a little disappointing, but its few incidents did not prevent you from attracting attention. In particular, my opposition has had a line of plot and plot, a group of merged talents made the work of the hero to save what was there. Miller's charismatic delivery and time was caused by trust. He plays a narrow line between the position and the master but never his anger is actually a structural engineer that claims to be. I would like to see this on a big screen but silence I was lucky to hire before it was lost.
