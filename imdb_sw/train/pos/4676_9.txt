I have seen the stimulation of this film, and its transparency is comforting in the world of quick fixes where we are used to love "good man" and hate "bad man." Scott Cohen, a very good television actor, does a great job of showing a black sheep / lost child who wishes to find his father's love and respect, as well as his widowed sister who has a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his typical picture of a good man as a father who separated his children and is now left with him who has always rejected. When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was happy with a very good orange way that was used to show family values, as explained by the director. <br /> This is a successor to the ordinary "ordinary people". I discovered, Judd Hirsch was in it, too!
