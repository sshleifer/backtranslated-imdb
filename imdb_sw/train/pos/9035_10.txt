Acting in this film was very good. As a amateur rock singer, I found very few mistakes. As a human, it touched my heart and my soul. Watching executives, you'll think it's real characters. Laura Dern, my good actress, did not leave anything out of her performance. Little players playing Rocket Boys showed their talent over their years, especially Homer younger. Homer's father led to the love of eternity / hatred between father and child so that you could be true. If you can't find a nose in your throat or right when the first successful rocket goes up or when the father and child agree, then get your blow (you can die).
