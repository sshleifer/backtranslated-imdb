THE last day will never win the ordinary audience. It is a slow but very interesting film for those who are willing to go with it. The Australian property lawyer is asked to take the case of five other lawyers sentenced to the murder of one of them. Many aspects and tips are soon coming, as the death of a person involves a tribal issue that did not mean a white court, and soon a lawyer has difficulty distinguishing facts from fantasy. It seems like the end of the world could be close, and he and the Aborigines can know this but no one else does. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is on its peak here. David Guptil, a well-known face from several Australians and a good actor, is one of five tested artists. The last light is not for everyone, no more than the MAGNOLIA (both occur with amazing things coming from the sky). Check out the late Saturday night.
