I was surprised by this film. It had basic causes of depression, depression, loneliness, despair, hope, dream and fellowship. It was not just about a musician who hit the ground but it was about someone who was sadly trying to find comfort in his music. He finds a friend who comes with his own issues. Claire and Des were able to give each other the friendship and love but the most important conclusion to the events that created their lives for the worst. Des is an impossibility character for today's rock stars. However he has music genius. He also has an event in his past that has made him all, when things close to him go to destruction. His goal is to create His Whale Music, in fact it becomes humble for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is a village child who needs a place to stay. He gets hidden talent while in the company Des. He also finds a special friend who accepts him. He learns to trust him for some time. These two get love for each other. It is not a sound mind, sex affects the kind of passion, but love that friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have suffered, they are honest together.
