Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I finished watching him again. I couldn't help being emotionally in its last place. He did not have Oscar. That's why you should put a lot of faith in Oscars. Richard Widmark did not have the best place and he was giving it fully as a 3-D person, a missing person. Jean Peters was as good as the street, a tough girl in her eternal role. And Richard Kiley must be very good; why would I have hated him. Yes, it was so standing on patriotism; but, without it, you don't have many movies. Look at their faces! The top three stars don't need much script. I would like to see them doing this film without discussion. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in the "Thief", perhaps you know what I'm saying. When I was in 1956 on my first NYC journey, I made my Bronx uncle ride us on the foot of the South Street Address on 66. That was when I knew that Hollywood can't be trusted. But I've got a river. I don't give him a lot of stories because I hate when I know what happens before I see myself. If you have seen it, no definitions are needed. Maybe, the person reading this comment has not seen "Pickup On South Street". You will paint it; not to search for the Southern 66 Street Address in New York City.
