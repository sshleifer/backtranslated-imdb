This movie was a comedy of fair entertainment about the Murphy Act applied to home ownership and construction. If a film like this was being done today of course the family will not be able to. Since it is set in half 'simple', we find what is supposed to be a normal family at that time. The real power combines the elements of comedic and major and works with more than the right vote displayed by Loy and Douglas. Their Shenanigans performs fifteen minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
