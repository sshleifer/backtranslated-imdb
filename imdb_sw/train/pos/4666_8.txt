It's very sly to look at 60 for the movie. Humor is very gentle, but it grew over me more than I expected. Sent is the first level and seem to have a good time. Ustinov walks through the film to reflect something interesting under his breath, and it's all not so much; I'll be able to buy the movie as soon as it comes out of the DVD. The program is that Ustinov as a player released from jail as a computer computer and destroys money from a US company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and looking away from many different jobs is part of fun. Bob Newhart is a normal size, and Karl Malden is happy as a strong and powerful executive who runs the London office. The latter is funny and nicely cynical.
