Care bears Movie 2: A new parent is not at all times of bad films. In fact, I love it very much. Yes I agree to talk is corny and the story is a little said repeatedly. But Darkheart, when the very dark is convincing enough to change the villain, and Hadley Kay did a very good job to show him. Pointing to the voice of action, it was good, nothing wrong with anything. Animation is a color, and some of the exhibitions at first were breathing. Songs and symbols are good, especially Grow and Ever Young, the last has always been my favorite of two. The ministry bears, who I love, is beautiful, and human children are also well done. And the end is a real cry. All in all, the angry kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
