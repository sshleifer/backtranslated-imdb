This movie feels like a film project. As the filmmakers took part of the cross of the community without experience and began to work. The characters are sort of not clear and stupid. Although this feeling of amateur, the movie works. It is like a passage of life and neighboring children try to identify or promote their sexual feelings. Resurrected with a great parent, no doubt from that generation there is a shame related to sex. This provides a predictable but well-managed conflict. Perhaps the most enjoyable is the way the main character grew slightly in his romantic relationship to realize the deeper depth of sexual feelings. Good looking but no motivation ....
