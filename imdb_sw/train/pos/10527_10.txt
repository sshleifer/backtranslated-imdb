This is one of the best movies I have seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but he's better like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is as good as Reverand Elton, and the sister of Emma Thompson, Sophie, is a hysterical like Miss Bates. And watching Jeremy Northam gorge as Mr. Knightley; it's gentle! Anyone who says you need sex and abuse on the movie to do well did not see Emma. I think it's that separates from many others - it's classy. If you are looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family, or you are looking for romance yourself, see no more. Emma is that movie. For a beautiful environment, a wonderful dress, and the best cast (did I mention Jeremy Northam good?), Emma is ten perfect!
