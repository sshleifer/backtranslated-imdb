I have seen many movies of Disney during my life, though none of them are engaged in any form of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I did not want to cross the action and animation, it was an improvement in trying to wear people like animation characters. The movie enters three rescuers from two world wars who are sent to stay with a quiet and social woman in the country. I would say that casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made the Miss Price full, while David Thomilson made a great passion. Finally it always surprise me and this was not discriminatory. It was neither happy nor sad, although I don't know if this was deliberate. The discussion was not good, but considering it was designed to be a child film, that's okay. In general, I will give nine out of ten activities, six out of ten talks, giving nine out of ten and eleven out of ten.
