I first saw this very riveting document released back in 2001, and it had a great effect on me, so that I had several friends to see me with me in a review. The bottom line: no my friend has gone away from the desire (ever!). This stellar film is about Scottish scientist, Andy Goldsworthy, who builds the perfect pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) To form pieces that eventually return to their normal form (information in The situation of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy to create several works of art time, with some of its long-term installations in the world wide, with a few pieces in the natural world, too. German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer explains, photographing and editing this reflection on the creative process that is a real eye for the eye and ear (with a lot of music, including and made by Fred Frith, whose music is usually tested / guitar sound of the texture, as well as architectural capacity of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for several years now, if you can find a movie that shows the revival of this beautiful film, by all means, the search (it is easily featured on a large screen, and a realistic sound system to see this film right ). No MPAA logo, but has never found anything wrong (except the birth of the sheep on the screen aims to hurt or disrupt)
