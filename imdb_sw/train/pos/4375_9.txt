Braveheart of Mel Gibson was an amazing film, but it left the taste of vinegar in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the contrary, is a little less polished, but the better film. This is a historical film that combines a timeless theme with true historical values, while Braveheart puts a wonderful and unpleasant gloss on the old story. What makes this film is thrown. Liam Neeson has a hero, in a role that was essentially shared (in water-down style) at Phantom's risk. Character is a hero, but not a great fighter or partner of a demon. He still deserves humanity, commands screenshots. Against him has been appointed a selection of human victims such as Tim Roth of Cunningham, a clever but brilliant, and John Hurt's legal laird. Also attributes are Jessica Lange, as a pragmatic wife of Rob: also a powerful and good, but 300 years away from modern heroine, which should only be. This is not the original film that you will see, but it has the courage of its own beliefs, and strong performances make you care.
