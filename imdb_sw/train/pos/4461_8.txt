I liked this film very much. I have seen Gene Kelly several outbreaks and this is one of the best. I would like to put it on the most popular American in Paris. Sometimes the story seems to disappear in the film Gene Kelly on a wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this film. It is definitely worth the lease.
