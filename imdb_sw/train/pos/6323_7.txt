Next to Collingwood offers some hilarious discussions in recent memory. Looking at this comedy directed by Brother Anthony and Joe Russo was probably reminded of another film we saw earlier, but since we missed the opening credit, we had to wait until the end to find out what we were told, was the 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> Brother Russo put together a good cast to show all the characters in the film. Anything by William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, late Michael Jeter, in it, can not be bad. Since this is a piece of linking all participants have the opportunity to shine. The film gives us a group of animals that can be safe from hell. No one can imagine that these men can work as they do. Anything can go wrong, and more, that's the way they do. George Clooney seems to be small as a safer host who also seems to imitate the rabbi, just confused with the priest and members of the group from Cossimo's funeral. The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and allow all these small stars to do the thing. Let their delightful lines make you laugh, if anyone can see this gang is destroyed from the beginning to the end!
