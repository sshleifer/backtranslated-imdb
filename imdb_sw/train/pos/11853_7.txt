Pod's life is one of those movies that just look and try to analyze the hardest. Acting is rather an amateur, for the better. Special effects are evident in the budget, but not very bad. The line of the story is rather a stock, but by moving with amazement. Running the computer is facing, but not exactly the computer and the amok running is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still the film has its time and it looks completely. For me, at least a delightful part of this film is the role of Kristine DeBell. He can't be a great actor in the world, but after being the old friend of that month, he is good enough. In all Pod's Life it is like some of the low-budget Sci-Fi films of the 1980s and some possible possibilities. White / White White is beautiful, if not quite good. The final certificate of the White Star Lines Company was purchased by Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to go under White Star was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold to scrap in 1960.
