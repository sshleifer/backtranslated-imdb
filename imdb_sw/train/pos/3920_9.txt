Movie inside the film - the concept has been made often in the history of the movie. It's done here and for anyone. <br /> <br /> If you love Carmen, you will like this version. <br /> <br /> If you like flamenco, you will like this version. <br /> <br /> The classic opera program is played out in the actual opera displays and flamenco troupe. Music is correct. Wonderful direction. <br /> <br /> If you would like to play, you will like this version. <br /> <br /> There is a catastrophe. There is enthusiasm. There is controversy. <br /> <br /> There is ... Carmen.
