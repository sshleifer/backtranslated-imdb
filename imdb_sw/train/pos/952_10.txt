So this has been done only for 7.6 TV shows on this site? Bah! Humbug! Without question this 1984 version of the Dickens' classic story is the best ever made. And yes, Hound has seen the 1951 edition that was also good, but not enough. The lack of color is perhaps a great failure for that version, although acting was amazing. George C. Scott is just amazing as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of the good businessman who is being beaten by the soul of his dead loved one, and then three other spirits later that evening. Scott is gruff well as Scrooge. In fact, some critics claim that he cannot achieve a new series of discoveries that he activates until Christmas morning after the spirit teaches him an important lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. She will never go to play on the road with joy. He is very respectful, and his Scrooge deals with his feelings in a real way. Helps are very helpful, such as clothing, music, and environment. 19th century London comes to life in the style of Clive Donner. The film has horrible limits on several events involving spirit. The key moral values ​​reflect through each chapter, though. You can't get this version again on TV again, and that's desperate. The 1984 Christmas Carol version should be a necessary part of the holiday ceremony. When decoration comes from the floor, this film should find its way into the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 stars.
