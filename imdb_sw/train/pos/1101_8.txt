While prices have increased so much, and some of the details have been in place, any owner who has difficulty with the ownership problems of the house should get far away from this movie. I know I did. <br /> <br /> Sir. Blandings, a New York executive executive, decides to transfer his family into Connecticut suburbs and build a beautiful house there. He goes into one jam one after another, from mortgages to charges for construction problems, because the cost and construction schedule continues to increase. I thought that the funniest events were where Blandings employs a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig down hundreds of feet, but they have no water. Still just a little away, a few days later, the flooding floor of his house! Cary Grant and Myrna Loy provide reliable exhibitions as a couple of troubled Blandings are full of problems that they have never thought of, and Melvyn Douglas is better off as a lawyer of Blanding and a family friend. The only cave is that the social perspective has changed very much since 1948. Mrs Blandings has been shown to be a little dimbulb who has no idea what extra trouble that causes, and there is a black girl (scared!). So don't look at this film through the social lens of 2003, and you will enjoy it more. <br /> <br />
