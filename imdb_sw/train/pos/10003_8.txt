This is not just a typical Mel Brooks. It was under a slapstick under his many films and actually had a plot that was legitimate. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is a very good actor, beaten down. There was a certain time that they could be closed more, and some of the events that could be cut to make it a chance to do it, but all in all, this has a lease value to see. Acting was good in general, Brooks himself did a good job without his direct speaking to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" all played their part well.
