It was lucky to be extra in this great film and loved every minute of the picture. They came to the Prime Minister in London and had a good conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as he did my wife.Fantastic after the party too. Then a few weeks later he was on his way to the movie with members of our club club. What a talented film, it deserves to be above with all the film's great biker. Now we have Sue DVD my wife can not get enough of it nor can children. Get a bit of stick from a club that seems to think I am a star of the film now oh well one can only dream. I think they're only jealous. The only obstacle to the first part of the picture was the weather, rain, rain and heavy rain but blessed when we were in Wales. We hope there will be a track so I can put Jon. Danny Beck
