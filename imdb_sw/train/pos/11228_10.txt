This is short and sure. The story of the story used by Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is amazing beautiful. Work is on the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked in improving their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has continued for nearly 7 years and will reach the end of May 2007. Considering this is all the dedication, for no benefit, it's very strange. If this was ranked as a professional production, I would like to give you 5 good stories but bad sets. However, if fan production had to give the best score as to discrimination and other efforts, this is in the league itself. To a large extent, I don't think this has been installed. Congratulations to staff and staff for the efforts that many like.
