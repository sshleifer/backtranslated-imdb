I have seen the latest DVD DVD movie of this movie shown in the "fear" section in the Oxford Street shop and was also declared as "exciting style". In fact it is just about Arthur Askey's car, one of the most popular names in the UK's leisure for more than four decades. Perhaps his unhappy, cheerful and commonly humorous comes comes as a bit of cultural shock for many who were delicious and stupid to the very comics of the UK's twenty-five years ago . Yet there are still those who enjoy her and cheery persona and avoid total pathos. Askey was a statue of Tommy Cooper who has often given "gorgeous" gag that Arthur tries to invite passengers stranded with. <br /> <br /> There are amazing surprises, rare and Linden down-rated Travers, which makes the effect as Julie's amazing.
