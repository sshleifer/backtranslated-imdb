Look for an interesting Japanese before the opening of the West. John Wayne as the first American consultant for Japan will come in accordance with the negotiations made by Perry's diplomacy. He was not welcomed. Wayne finally defeats his meeting with Shogun after bringing a cholera epidemic, brought by the US ship, under control. There are the following color protests for gift-bearing gifts for Shogun, including the Old Tanglefoot bottle. The meeting with Shogun, a debate among Japanese leaders and massacres during the exhibition exhibition appear to look attractive in the politics of the period. Any interesting thing and over how many times you see Duk lose fighting with half the size of a guy.
