This is one of the most horrible films that require a greater understanding of the term 'fear' to be praised. The main thing people may fail to realize is that this story is told through a young view and, as with many young children, is easily afraid. Especially because he does not know only things, as why his father did not go to him. From watching the film you can see a man resisting his wife's balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but a little boy does not. One can also imagine a boy being afraid of trees, as earlier in the film, that the family is from the city. Also, at first the family travels home to the pigs, then considered, then they argue with the locals about it, and the little boy never found this the introduction of the most beautiful forest. "Wendigo" is ultimately what her boyfriend, an innocent mind builds all of this. There is an Indian story, but when looking at a place where a little boy hears about it, it is explained to him as clearly and easily. Not because that is what Wendigo really is, but because he understands. When you watch the film from this point of view you can actually start to understand it. Obviously it was a low budget and was hit for cheap, but plans to fly, use light, and much more energy than it did. And the last question the film asks is: Is it all your head, or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated: violence, violence, and sex
