I got this film on my video video I expected to be another American vampire film proposed in the "Lost Kids" series (1987). To my amazement "To Die for" is a pretty good movie. A little corny sometimes, but there are still enough pieces of delicate pieces and surprises to satisfy the vampire's passion.
