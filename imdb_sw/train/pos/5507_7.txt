I can't be surprised if Soderbergh had to avoid making Cuba's protests as bad as it was. Just writing a few statistics will not do so with a small group. However, one part, which is close to the jungle, takes a sense of the place, especially when you go through the mountains of Cuba. I loved the commentary of Del Toro of Che Guevara's personality. And the actors who play Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, against all the problems. It is obvious that Soderbergh is not destroying these people, but it is also clear that he will not ask their case for 'far away' and now. Some important historical issues contradict what I have read. With my skills Castro had no court in the Soviet Union until all the experiments from the United States lost. But on other things he is correct, especially as the looting of migrants as the island went to another rebel control. The country's treasury remains empty.
