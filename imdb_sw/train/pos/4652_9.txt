I think this movie has been done well and really. I've been expecting to watch the "Hollywood" movies, and using it as a standard measure this movie, you should despair. This movie is closer to a real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what stimulates the movie's average action. I have no experience with the Swedish army, and therefore can not explain any errors through the act. But as I have seen additional "decisions" I believe that it happens so much to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I recommend to others to watch. The story about the true quality and movie.
