I wonder if this movie can still be made. I look at all kinds of movies at all times with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I saw to see. I have never thought that a 146-minute film could make me think about it on and on. Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, an anti-former terrorist agent who has been taken to the bottle. As soon as she had to protect the little Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, her emotional and liberal arc returns only in the way a little girl can be able to offer. Unfortunately, Pita has been kidnapped by strokes, and Creasy decides that many of Mexico City should pay the price to have the courage to take the recipe of teddy-bear-clutching his character. Yes, he has been ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You must see this film.
