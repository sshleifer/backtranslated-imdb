This movie was very strange, and very strange. All characters are real and very unusual. "Looking" for the general film was different, too, a dreamy and bleached-out type, which just added to spacey, fumbling, weird vibe of the whole thing. Not for everyone, I mean, not what you can call "rule" but what I liked about it. It's different from what I have seen before. . . unpredictable, with an amazing rhythm and punch lines in very strange places. Children are a goofy of the heart (and pimply) which you can not help but feel them. In other words, these are far from "hollywoodized" young versions. It all, which to me, does a good thing.
