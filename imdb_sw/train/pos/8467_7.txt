I loved this movie because it basically did more for less. It would be more interesting if they put it on even more labels (although some of the plot elements would be difficult to develop). The person who played DJ did a good job to show someone who was hurt and haunted with his memories. I also had a conversation with the best callers. <br /> <br /> When the movie parts you see come miles away, other places you don't expect to stop the way they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a small story of the spirit for the most part, focusing on the side of the equation life. The last 5-10 minutes were done well if everything was revealed. Though it was a short movie, it found that it was only a short time of right story. It would also have begun to jump.
