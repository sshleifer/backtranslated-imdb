This modern film was unfortunate to be released at the same time of the most famous Amelie, both with Audrey Tautou's amazing role playing. Laurent Firode, a talented director made one of the most enjoyable films from France in recent memory. The movie deals with space, as the English title that shows. France's head describes how butterfly wings can set up anarchy on the Atlantic when they explode, along with dust in the Pacific, something that is not only necessary to look at these colored insects. From the outset, the director incorporates all those who see in the film and how each one has a relationship with another, which is hard to imagine, but in the form of the film seems to work well. <br /> <br /> Space meeting in the metro puts the sound of the film. Irene, who will work, is asked by a woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign and keeps reading from her paper. Irene, it seems to cross the path and will find her spirit the same day. After Irene left the train, a quiet young man sitting next to the woman told her she had a birthday date like Irene. It seems to be planned for the beginning from the beginning, but woe, they will no longer come back to the last frame of the film. Audrey Tautou is amazing as Irene. Faudel, who plays with Younes, does not have much to do until the end, but shows he has a presence and plays well in his part. Talented young people make an important contribution to the success of the film, which is like butterfly wings. We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he seems to be the director and the heart in a good place and ear in the way people are connected.
