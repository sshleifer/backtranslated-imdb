I am a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and a 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed a movie. The movie is original, bold, fast and very interesting. The plan was enough for a 10-year-old man to follow, but to lose enough to put an adult. I thought Emma Roberts did a very good job and all others were beaten well. My only argument is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should be. They were working, but nothing had stopped. On the other hand, pretending, clothing, lights, movies, editing and leadership were excellent. In general, I thought it was an enjoyable experience. I was disappointed that academic critics (almost all adult males) had ever attacked the film. It seems, they have something against films showing powerful, intelligent and independent women. Their writings reveal more about their sexual background than anything about this wonderful family film. I strongly recommend each child and every parent.
