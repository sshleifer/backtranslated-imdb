This is a very rare film because a star with a high bill is not visible to half the way. However I was involved with the Lady Phantom hook. Curtis, though charged with Scott Henderson, appears to be very difficult to be compassionate towards (perhaps he should ignore his mustache) and his behavior when he returns home must be convinced of the least at least some of his guilt. When another advertiser had trouble with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe saw his voting for the character to be very difficult. He is not a villain of stock. Good actor of Elisha Cook Jr. it is no longer in high form as a 'little man with great expectations.' His flight to music numbers added touch to the invasion. However, this film is made by Ella Raines who is very capable and beautiful as a volunteer would like Henderson, Carol Richmond. He certainly has the talent and its presence of screens are in the culture of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of his work I have seen and it is obviously walking to see other roles. Some of the cast are also more capable. All in the secret of the most fun secret film which today viewed perfectly provides the world of darkness and tough thinking. Recommended, 8/10.
