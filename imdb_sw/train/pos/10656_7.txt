What is the great film of Barbara Stanwyck that I saw to see the other night. "Risk" was amazing. It was done in 1953 and perhaps with two bills but stressed along my seat. Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with Doug's husband (Barry Sullivan) and son Aaker are driving in a fishing zone in Mexico for vacation. The man falls from the plane and the only way he can be saved is if Barbara returns to the garage with a certain string. While passing through there he runs a psychologist (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and what follows is a cat game with a mouse like Barbara tries everything in his power to get Meeker to come with him to dismiss her husband. The movie was awesome and this surprise - I didn't expect this beautiful film. But I think I should have noticed - there is anything that Stan Stanwyck does that is a strange thing?
