This is the beginning of a new series of new Star Trek and interesting. It has a "bottom-down" - feel of a low sense and "low" of scenography. They need more time to develop but they are able. The one thing that is sad (along with all the series of Star Trek in fact) is that they show the same picture of equality between men and women in the future when they take the best pictures about everything else. (The world has stood the war, the famine etc.) <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Hoshi is completely wimpy and T'Pol is being made "child of vulcan". Some of the attitudes of the workers feel very little of America (as opposed to the more international employees of TNG) but it builds interesting trends. Very good quiz though with a very good series.
