Who is voting on these levels? "Jacknife" is a very good work, taken gently, with actors on their game, especially Ed Harris and Robert DeNiro who can not be happy (please do not say Marlon Brando in one breath of this person "Taxi driver" for confirmation of this step). What? It's a 'mundane movie' because it does not have sex / indecent action / dirt in it. This movie is about the problems of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes fun every time and he and his emotional deficiency towards the end is a terrible heart. The section that orders a young man in the bar to pick up his military clothes is a good study of how fashion and movies use the worst situation and how true men who suffer should feel to see the military attire of the top games. When we are on this issue, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the largest films of all time, from one of the biggest directors, with the most popular film actor at all times, with a more psychological psychological group, just guaranteed above average? Come on !!!!!
