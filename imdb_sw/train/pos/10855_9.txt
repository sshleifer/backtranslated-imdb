Looking back over the past 28 years (since I first showed on the show), all I can say is: Once you get-it will remain with you forever. I remember my initial reaction to: 1) the overthrow of pain, 2) under produced 3) non-competent characters / Well, two years later I looked at other events again and I did not find it almost like to offend. A year later I was able to get the whole series from the beginning and quickly came into the fascinating story of human error and attitudes about happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I am sure the production value of dated will be difficult to deal with now. But, I still think about the show at least once a month with the incomprehensible eyes of what was seen as easy times ... BTW I am a married man ... (for all who think this is a show for women)
