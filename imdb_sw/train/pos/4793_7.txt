After seeing this film I feel like I know a little more about USA. David Lynch is similar to the value of shock and weird for fraud, and in fact these things do not apply to Straight. However it is light that I have not seen from Lynch before. We start with a simple family to live a quiet life but end up with different types of wonderful and deep characters in their lives that can not be apparent from their introduction. Particularly moving was the bar area with two WWII veterans talking about the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current and emotional lives. If you are looking for Wild in Heart or Dune, don't look here. But if you are looking for real people and real stories this is a film for you.
