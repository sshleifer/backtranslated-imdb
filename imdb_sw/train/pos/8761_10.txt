I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks very amazing in her role. The movie is just bad because it seems two suspects seem to be in some Monastery, working as monks in grass and under close military-like discipline. Acting with the film and the amazing color of what is supposed to be Thailand is an eye-catching, but Claire Daines steals the whole movie, and it is very unexpected in learning a complicated lesson of life itself to the end, in the act of extraordinary unselfishness you have heard and unexpected quite in the real world. Right is a minute and I recommend the film, which seems to bury the sad for ever the TV show. I for one you want the film for my collection - a collection of only "10" films. See, you will be greatly affected.
