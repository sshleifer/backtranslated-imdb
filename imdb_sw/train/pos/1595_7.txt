When I would say I enjoy the show, I expected something quite different when I first saw 'What I like about you' I expected to find something along 'All' (I don't know if it continues again) but I must say if the show and when I don't classify as a successful achievement, it's personalized very much and I like chemistry among the characters also (including helping help) <br /> <br> I would like to say that it is best to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I have loved him so much in Guy City. I also saw a woman who plays a friend of Valerie in the Popular and when I think it is a good show, I don't like her character in this show because she is not just my cup of tea but she comes out very well
