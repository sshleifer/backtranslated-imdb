Okay. Yes, this was a movie-tight-budget with persistent errors (like one explicit scenes closed in the sun and then in the shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso was often very good at burnt - and part, and some small cast were bad (with at least one actor was used for two but clear responsibilities). But come. Richard Grieco was a hysterical (his hair alone is worth a trip). Steven Ford was very good. Mancuso had a good line, when Nancy Allen, surprisingly, was quite bland and was not happy. Classic? No. The worst part? Yes. Entertainment? That's great. I would have been placed on the day they decided what kind of Grieco hairstyle would have. "Do you have a hurry?" ... "Don't do it quickly."
