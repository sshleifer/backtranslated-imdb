This movie has never been considered, although this is one of the best pieces of connecting, and one of the true stories I have seen on the screen. It seems clear on a small budget in V.A. real. Hospital, in the middle of the story is Joel, played by Eric Stoltz. Joel has been paralyzed with a motorcycle accident, and he comes to hospital for ward and other people who have spinal injuries. Joel likes Anna, his beloved partner, played with Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of her work of winning the Academy Award. Even though Joel-Anna's relationship is a primary focus, there are many other characters developed in the county. Wesley Snipes does a great job like angry Raymond. Even more surprising is William Forsythe as a strong and racist bloss. I think two Forsythe pictures are when he is broken and angry with squad players, and later, he feels compassion for a young Korean man who was shot in a shop. My favorite part and Snipes are in the discussion of the gender choice after the injury. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very powerful, and has very close relationships, but not free, sex. Orgasm in the county is interesting. There is also another area in which Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take a special device to the bar. True is the comedy of mistakes when they do their weak attempts to get van to see "naked women." <br /> <br /> Stories are made even more poignant by the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, has been paralyzed in real life. This is his story. This film is real, not surprising or flashy. Having a talent of talent in a small budget that's amazing. I recommend this film to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that improve the second look. It is embarrassing that this piece of work is ignored, but through video, perhaps it can get the attention that is most suitable.
