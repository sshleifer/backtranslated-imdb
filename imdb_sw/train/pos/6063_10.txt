The lost members of the Kingdom are a movie about a young boy (Simon) who has been banned from his kingdom because of his father (king) killed by a "bad adviser". This movie refers to Simon's adventures. Special effects, conspiracy, act, and generally everything about this movie is BAD. However, it is very bad that it is funny. You will continue to watch this film just because it is so bad, and, if another movie reviewer said, it's very bad.
