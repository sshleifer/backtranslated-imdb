Someone On Fire tells the story of a young boy who has a drinking problem who receives a job as a human-defender of a young girl in Mexico when the slaughter for compensation. At first he is not friendly, but then he becomes a friend, decides to stop drinking, etc. ... then one day he gets kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> HE, he can't leave anything to take revenge. It is based on the story of a person on Fire but you expect a big change for a few times including a good end and will make you cry. This is also because of the great music Harry-Gregson Williams and Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) included. <br /> <br /> But the most part of the film ... wait .. .. The thing is, everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First - acting. Denzel Washington is better, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always, Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then an interesting movie with good editing, would have won Oscar for sure. <br /> <br /> Myths are ... not just a movie of revenge. The story is of the mind, the story makes you think ... and it's clean. True. <br /> <br /> This is one of these movies you need to see during your life, at least once!
