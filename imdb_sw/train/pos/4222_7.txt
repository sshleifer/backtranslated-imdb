I like this little part, Ruth Gordon is good if it's not a little hammy as she was. As it has been said, music is very good, and it has enough conditions that are not available at all times. But one big hole in the field is, so wide can drive a truck of trucks through it. It has been established that light does not work in the vault. What? Do you think that a very intelligent or other police Columbo would think to look like a lighting tube worked? You would like to think in a short order that they could make a bulb and so find the details. This is indeed a false televised television, and various holes will be available every time, but this seems to be very much. It does not make Columbo out of the cell that is hidden when light does not work but "the bed of death" the testimony continues without giving birth, looks for the day.
