Let's go straight to the point: this is the Movie I took with me on a desert island (with dvd player). It's just perfect. If the reason for filming is that you like actors, you would like to see them free to share in space and emotions, this film is for you. See the location when Myrtle (Rowlands) comes to the point of drinking with Maurice (Cassavetes) should erase because it is no longer valid for the script. If you are wise for camera movements, you will be impressed by the way the camera goes to action, respectively, that gives you a camera camera to follow the actors as if it is dominated by the display of "private space" ... And the story is a mix of stories and real stories. Cassavetes again competes with Hollywood and majors politics, but this time, it does through Broadway, doing one exciting film on the theater. Well, this film is fun.
