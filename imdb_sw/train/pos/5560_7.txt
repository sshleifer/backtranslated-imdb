SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The mine member said MOVIE NEXT was the best Cheech & Chong clicking and arose his way to me borrow it with BLUES BROTHERS. The next MOVIE does not plot, is not available, does not have anything that defines the film ... but it's funny. And why it's important, Cheech and Chong reflects the heart. Well, in this little text I have put it in a conspiracy, but that is four-fifths of the movie, nothing is happening that begins to start the story. I just say that the cousin of Cheech shows up. <br /> <br /> What! No other funnier when Chong made Cheech drink pee twice? What about a cock? Was the first movie Pee-Wee Herman? You should watch your own movie to enjoy. I don't think MOVIE NEXT has enough balls to make it amazing, but the movie has a heart and hey, my buddy would like to give it so it gets 7.
