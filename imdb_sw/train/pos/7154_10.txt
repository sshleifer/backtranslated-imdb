I have seen about the movie "Holes" by hearing from people that it is not usually Disney, that both children and adults came into the story. Folks, let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. "Holes" is based on a novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a young man who is sent to a foreign camp detention camp outside the desert. He becomes a friend of a boy named Zero and together they come out in an adventure that changes their lives. It was amazing, unique, different and interesting. I didn't know exactly what to expect when I looked at it. It was interesting to see stories come together as pieces of the puzzle. Those boys who played religious youth were all so wonderful and Jon Voight was hilarious as Lord Mr.. Now that I have seen movies, I must read a book. Many were recommended!
