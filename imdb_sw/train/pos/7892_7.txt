FREDDY has come out with a terrible for funny, in the 6th phase of a series of dreams. It has been 2 years, well 11 years since this film takes place in 2001. And FREDDY has killed every last child on Elm street except one, John Doe (Jacobb from section 5, even the film's films on The feeling he is), which uses to bring more children to come to the street Elm. Only FREDDY gets his wishes, but also gets his daughter to return to Elm street. We can also see some of the original FREDDY backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has had a long-standing dream and now. Many people hate this film, but I liked it. It tried to bring what FREDDY did with its wishes ... COMDEY and makes a series more of hearing than scary So this film is very hard to talk. <br /> <br />
