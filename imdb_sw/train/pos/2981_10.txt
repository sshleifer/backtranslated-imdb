Why crap is this movie tested? I have seen this film more than 25 times, I know every line on this film. It is obvious that I love this film. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and a new star bed of the American team) as main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Especially they are just known as Coop and Remer in the movie. Then the film begins to remind us of the full hunger of the world of the most paid games, even reaching one called "Townsell." I must tell you this part of the film since it is true and some games start: "And after playing New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, the year for the Arganauts of Toronto, as well as one of the largest season in the Desert Desert I enjoy finally play here the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent depends on:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important piece of movie. So it begins to be Coop and Remer have been in the high school of secondary school and realize that they still have nothing as they talk to their old counterparts. Outside they create BASEketball game after being challenged with what was perhaps basketball heroes. After deceiving the game continues for almost a year. This time they can recruit Squeak of their third team, which is actually the day after creating the game. As the next film we see that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only heroes of the games left. The story follows you with the nectar, the Mawaukee's beer, and the sense of humor will not leave it for more. Look at it dude, it's hilarious.
