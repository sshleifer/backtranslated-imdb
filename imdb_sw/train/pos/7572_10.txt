I can only believe that these games can get better, but it does. Unfortunately I was forced to hire a Dreamcast play, but even though I beat them I can't wait to buy for PS2. This is the only series of games that I have to keep all of them even though I have beaten them often over. I hope they don't stop making this kind of game even if the series must be the end. <br /> <br />
