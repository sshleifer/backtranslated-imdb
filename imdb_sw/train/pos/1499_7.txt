For the 1970s fans of the hammer of the hammer, this film should be treated. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the fact that Peter Cushing was lost in the worst part. In general, however, this is a solid, non-spooky movie. If this is not the best film of Amicus, it is certainly one of them. The best time, certainly saved to the end, is one with Jon Pertwee as an awesome actress - it's very good. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it is difficult to believe it did not do more of these types of movies. All in all, this is a movie of entertainment, which was my fear from me as a child, and which still gives me creeps to this day.
