I am believed that this film is not available on IMDB. It is one of those movies that can be easily accessed by someone, but with a romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is actually in class alone. It is a set and tribal charm is things that people seem to consider. Offering alone makes the movie almost entirely. A small movie in the 1980s were good as "Moonstruck" and also funny. **** out of *****
