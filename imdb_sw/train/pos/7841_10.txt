this is actually treating every fan of Bolan, others may think it is over, and that's about Ringo and Marc's egos, but I think it's similar to any video video, except for the fact that this is Marc bolan, not just anyone ! I loved music videos for revolutionary children, and Elton John and Ringo Starr. This only piece is worth all the money, I can't believe they didn't release this version as one. The movie is more beautiful, especially for us to play. Now, I was not living during the 70 years. But it played regularly was shot from what is happening around them. The media did not play or show any old music at the time, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, played a bit with Doors, just the most popular songs though. so, I know from my father, that seeing this, he brings back part of his youth, he had no experience. <br /> <br /> I can't do it for so long, so ... a little fan of Marc Bolan, you need to see this. you can get boring or as previously described, slightly above. But at least you have seen one of the best musicians, in practice! The only thing that does a little bit, is that the White Swan ride is not on the tape. but I forgive, since Jeepster and Get It On is very amazing played.
