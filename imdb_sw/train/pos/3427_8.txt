This film shows the worst part of the war, memory. For many soldiers, men and women alike, return home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from WWII. For one of my brothers the war has never been. He was saved in the D-Day invasion, something similar to the first 20 minutes of saving Private Ryan. For him the memory is not only that it has been but it has caused him to suffer. He was a drunkard like several brothers, his sons. Jump before 60 years and put troops in different battles, in different countries, the result is the same. When I saw this on KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there are certain things about the war that do not change. Unscrupulous men and women did not escape the emotional pain that occurred in Iraq, and especially if you are opposed to war you will come to be more sympathetic to soldiers there there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right. <br /> <br /> The line of the tag from the Vietnam War Platoon film says it all. "The first destruction of the War is guilty."
