We should remember that 50 years was almost empty slate when it reached movies. The hand was switching from racial films, red colors, two string shoes, etc. to movies and messages. We had a jungle board, on water and so on. Some people might think that it was improving. I am not. Who is the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was the same. These psychological attractions are less entertainment than some kind of distant remedies. <br /> <br /> This is a pip. It is about three sisters trying to fight the control of their deceased father property. One of them, perhaps the only one of the value of redemption helps the pilot company to help him keep the whole family. She is beginning in it for bucks, but eventually falls for her. At the same time all family planning to lose romance. Results can be predictable. You get a little bit of everything in this film. Sexual tension between sisters. Little Machachism. The value of inheritance - if there is such a thing. We can't come to meet the parents, but we must really have been beaten. Sent is usually unknown. One or two participants have a voice without knowing. Acting is very bad to believe. It was released under United States Artists and a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot by almost LA at night and probably without permits. The end was very strange I thought it was joke. It was as if they lost money and the producer decided to close the center of the area. I can't explain - even to myself - but I have given them this bunch of trash 8/10. I have been known by the word "It's so bad it is good", but I don't think it will ever run into the matter before. Maybe, maybe "Fire and Hell Sticks", but this is appropriate. You may want to try this if you like movies that appear to be made under someone.
