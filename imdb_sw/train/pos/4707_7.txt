"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit and missing comedy that has laughs and "huh?". But I show them the opportunity. I think it's very high looks. Not many people who provide this film space. It works. Just think of it as a little bit of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go up in life. He only uses his way from great bosses to a good wife. And of course if many movies of people, someone wants to die. 90% of jokes laugh. Like, I said to give them an opportunity. Just take your favorite movie gangster and combine comedy in. You have "Johnny Class". <br /> <br /> 7/10
