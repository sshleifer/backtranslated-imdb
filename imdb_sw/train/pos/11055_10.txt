Well, what can I say, unless these people are Super for every way. I am like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this series of Nostalgic clean. I would have been given this authority, Think of me, being beaten away from my circuit, somewhere else and facing cold, and rising in a special hospital. Later, I discovered that my body has grown. Like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure actions and emphasize all the way, You can't fight with these three people, if they would win you in all weapons. Music is well written, and to me, it puts a beautiful picture of 3 beings well in my mind, the kind of power the champions have the same as our dog or cats, Improving forward, Hearing hearing and touching. and the power of 10 people for Richard and Craig and the power of 3 women for Sharon. I thought it was good and intelligent. When I was a boy, I was very cracked on it! Now I see why, on my DVD installed. The box is very good and comes with a free booklet about each series. I also thought that Trymane was a good boss, solid but made things!
