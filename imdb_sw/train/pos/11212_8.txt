This photo came in 1975 and was the second in the three parts of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson replaces Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew holds Mobster Pinky Dobson. Finally when we saw Pusser's Sheriff was sitting in the hospital bed after he and his wife who was killed in a Sunday morning car. After Pusser is restored he goes after men killed his wife. What? Pusser can complete the retaliation that he is after or making that group trying to take him before they succeed. The only thing that bothers this picture is that this was a real story. How can you leave the city of this crime and still do nothing about it? Since there was a real name actress in this photo I can't give 10 weasel stars but I can give 8
