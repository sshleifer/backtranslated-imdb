I have joined IMDb so that people can know this beautiful film! You don't usually get a movie that migrates and watches the movie but is humble. You read the plot all I want to say is not to look at it because you want to see a conflict of cultural identity, because it is an unusual behavior that people are learning, rather than just knowing and recognizing it about a father and child on a journey to grow to learn. The way to fight them. Buy and pass it before the film4 get round. This was one of the few films selected for BAFTA to be free and foreign. Its beauty is that it can appeal to anyone even if you look at anything that has a head or just used for Hollywood formula, just a good story that will keep you involved. The only thing I want is for a long time to see what happens
