I remember seeing this film on television several years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was lighter and increased. I decided to go back again last night to see if I was there for the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most exciting and surprising films of all time and has a great impact on the film today and probably forever. I can't believe I thought this film was awesome! Jon's child who is seen by Burt Reynolds gives his performances and shares with Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a sense of dirt and fear long after watching it, it's really terrible. Oh, and I told him that the theme of the theme is great, too? Well it is, and this film should be seen by the fans of the film everywhere. Everybody should see this film for experience. It's not just expect a picnic.
