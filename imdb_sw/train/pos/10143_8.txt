This was a good place, one of the best summer of all the summer. Under the fear of change, and the story which is a way over the average periods of MOH, if there is such a thing. The man's wife has been burned to death in a terrible car which he was driving. His airbag worked, he did not work. She has burned more of the diagnosis (good makeup btw), and was not given a lot of live space without a full greft of skin. But, even in coma, he keeps dying but returned to modern technology, and when he died for a few minutes, his spirit looked like a spirit of revenge. The murder is certainly going on, and also the murder of the very gory, and also, some very many pictures. Would you like to ask more, can you ask? Well, not so much, because this child has all, and the end of satirical, which should leave a smile to the most faced audience. I loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn) too, has a great knack of fear. The best time, this is the one I buy for sure.
