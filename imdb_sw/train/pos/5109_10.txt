I grew up in Houston and had nine when this movie came out. As a result I don't remember anything about the movie. But I remember the feeling that was caused by Gilley and the mechanical cattle to hit Johnny Lee's "Lookin 'song for Love" which still brings childhood memories whenever I hear. However, a few years ago I saw this film for the first time as an adult and all I can say yes, I was beaten. Film films have hit me hard. This movie is as raw and real as you can find. From the house of Uncle Bob, the chemical plant in Texas City, the Gilley dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe because it doesn't have a broad appeal. But no matter how you feel about the music of the country (I for a person cannot stand up despite my Houston root) In Cowboy is a special piece of American pie. For this reason I love it!
