"Xizao", is a story about the collision of modern life and ancient traditions, and its impact on families in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), is dead. He finds that his father is still alive, with his old business and his old business, public bathroom. Movie centers near Da Ming's family, and how she needs to learn the importance of her father's work, something that she had taken of old traditions that had to die soon. Also, the movie examines its relationship with Er Ming, who is a mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that cleans their bodies, but also their spirits. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, family and development problems, are very well addressed, and the movie will never lose the point he is trying to make, all the themes are very good development and we get the view of the Chinese community and the custom director , Yang Zhang, says his story in a simple way, allowing characters to work. It is a very simple technique, but it resembles a perfectly movie, and I am very doubtful that another style would suit this beautiful film. Zhang has great potential, for he can say a story without the help of a visual flare or camera. It is best in its natural way, everyone acts in a natural way and looks like if they were real people being done. The three leading actors offer amazing performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming certainly steals the show. Even when the movie would have been locked in the "old days it was better" the message, instead it takes a balanced attitude, as to say that development is good, and we must continue, but we should not forget where we have come, and keep the balance between modern life and old traditions. <br /> <br /> Wondering, and touching the film. 8/10
