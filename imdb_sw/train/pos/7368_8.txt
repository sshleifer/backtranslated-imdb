I think the team behind this film did a very good job with the shortcomings they had. only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks write, film and edit something around which I think is a success itself. although this film is not for civilians (like a innocent innocent girl being killed and there is a homo-eroticism involved in the story) I think that this film is a heartwarming epidemic and more inclusive in the story, more sadly you feel. more for Heaton because of the love he feels but he does not return. This is one of my favorite British films that I enjoyed so much and could look again. I think that is a shame that the film is not very known.
