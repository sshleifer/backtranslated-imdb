If you are a purist, don't waste your time - otherwise, hold on to your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen several times, but this film is very good, it's just different. I will not disclose the difference because it would damage the film. Also, it's a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I am a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is as good as Quatermain, and holding a hand is good. I see the quality of supporting one of the trademarks of the Hallmark Production and this film was not different. The movie is royal and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you can't despair.
