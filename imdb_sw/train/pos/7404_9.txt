You have seen only Australia's first Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Festival. The description program says it was - a perfect, made, exciting, exciting and very powerful. I could not accept more. I hope only some films have reached this level of entertainment and I expect to see more Chinese films planned to be displayed in Sydney in the coming months.
