It helps if you understand Czech and you can see this in the native language and understand the Czech rebellion and 'experts', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is still another great Czech film. It's funny, dark and very enjoyable. The best congratulations I can pay is that you do not know exactly what is going to happen next and even put that feeling in a second and third look. For a small country Czech Republic has produced an amazing amount of film and world class class, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera for Menzel, Sverak and many others. The Czech humorous nature is dark and often includes, but often has feelings of ignorance and heat after it. The film is just that, it does not recommend and deals with the most unpopular parties, but under all there is a good story filled with promises, goodwill and hope. I highly recommend this and other Trojan and Machacek projects are involved. To enjoy, it's a film made just for that reason - however, it is almost like Czechs will come to write last fun ...
