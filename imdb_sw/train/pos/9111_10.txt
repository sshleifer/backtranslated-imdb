"Capitães de Abril" is very good. Stories are not a document on the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. Story of the story is not recommended interest, but it does not spoil the movie. Captain Salgueiro Maia's actions are not spread and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia is still one of many heroes of the April 25 Revolution. Lisbon seems to be very good. Don't miss it! I loved this film very much.
