"Story Straight" is a very good movie about an old man named Alvin Straight, who climbs his knife across the country to visit his brother who was a stranger, dead. But that's the basic synapsis ... this film is much closer than that. This was the responsibility of Richard Farnworth before he died, and it is obvious that he will be remembered for. He is an old man, not different from many people in the past who you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "Similar Stories" is a movie that everyone should look at least once in their lives. It will reach down and touch some of your parts, at least if you have a heart, it will.
