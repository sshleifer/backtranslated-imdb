This is a common, customized comedy, held in Brazil on a small budget. The cluster is normal, similar to the film Danny Kaye's 1950 ** In Double **: a person who, like a soup, has a sense of a famous person then comes out to make a real person. <br /> <br /> The difference between the two guidelines is very effective. Raul Julia as a German-Paradori secret police, is a long, cold, cool and Latin. He games a definite color of colored color paint. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York Jews, is funny and compassionate. There are many references and jokes about the show business. <br /> <br /> The layout is clear on Paraguay. Paraguay has indeed ruled from the fifth century to the end of the eight years by Founder Alfredo Stroessner, a military dictator who was not elected by his father from Germany. But the author / director Mazurszky reveals his inner ignorance when he paints the Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin-American injustice, and it is very different in wealth and rebellion of guerrilla. Additionally, Mazursky offers comic Jonathan Winters as a retired American who is actually C.I.A. The head of the Parador center with a very strong figure that can give the President of the land dirty. <br /> <br /> In fact U.S. they have little influence in Paraguay, which has largely social and color tension in another region in the region. This is due to the country to fight many and costly battles against the largest neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost canceled twice but the society that emerged was a patriotic, racially homogeneous and stable unity. At the other level, there is a humanity in the manner of Madonna behavior. Played with Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is an old night doctor who is a happy body of the body at the beginning of the film but is seen on television as the president himself at the end - is now politically correct and good, no makeup, world hair pulled back, cancellation of office and velvet revolution. At one time that happened in South America, Isabel Peron's reign of Argentina (not the beloved Evita, who had no office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the story ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
