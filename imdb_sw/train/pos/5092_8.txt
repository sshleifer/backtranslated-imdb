I thought Mines of King Solomon was done well. My only storage was Alison Doody. His work was very good but his creation and hair were not of that period, and always seemed to make him away from other characters. I thought Patrick Swayze was the best choice for Alan Quatermain. It was good to see an actress, very bright in this role after staying through the movie after the movie and the right-holders, the leather characters like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was the best choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version cannot be compared with the 1950s by Stewart Grainger. It was a great movie screen and not released for TV film. I thought both of them were honest but two medias should be placed separately. I hope to see this again again, and I hope Patrick Swayze will look again at these roles.
