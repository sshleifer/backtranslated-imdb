You would like to be forgiven for a Finnish director from Helsinki will not be a good leading movie of the American movie (especially in the US prison) - see this to prove that you are not wrong! It was produced in 80 years after all, and the film was done on the most appropriate budget for a modern TV company announcement (something that I think anyone can see today why everyone is accustomed to the $ 100m + coin The bad intelligence industry!) become the first producer of Mr Harlin and - at least what these days will be considered to be stellar - cast. I still think more of the Nordic contribution to the film industry in general is more than the screenshots of Stellan Stargaard (not mentioning the leadership of Mr Bergman's well) - at least for all female viewers - but this seems really confirms there is a proper talent film out of the US and Hollywood to make us look at the film in doubt. Try and watch this film even if you won't be afraid, IMO is very appropriate!
