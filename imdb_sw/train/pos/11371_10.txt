This is a wonderful piece of movie success. From the beginning I was already involved with the story (true) when Lt Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) was crying while working in the villages of the children's bodies. That's the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, surprisingly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). Indeed, he plays very well and sympathetically that the viewer almost begins to sympathize with him, until we remember what he did. Psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, played by wonderfully Max Von Sydow believed in every detail, and what he did when talking about the paranoia in the Soviet Union, also appears to the Commissar Bondarchuk's Communist behavior played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the best performance was from Donald Sutherland, pointing out once again the best practices. I was close to tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had followed him closely and praised his work. The film plays Silence of the Sheep in the shade, from the atmosphere of the Soviet atmosphere and intuitive, for the top performances of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I am playing this 10/10 film
