"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I have seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as "sword operator". The great hero (Sasha) was born with a unique power: he can protect himself with a sharp sword coming out from under the skin in his hand. On the first side he can seem superhero more foolish from the unprofitable movie about trivial and emotional events. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can not even be called a hero. I think he is the only person who has lost his mind in his life and faith in goodness, justice and love. In her life she has never met someone who would know and love her (except her mother). Each step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everyone for his gift that became his judgment. And suddenly she meets him. He doesn't need a sluggish conversation and details. He loves him for what he has. He doesn't care what he did. The fact that he is close to him is more important than anything else. But soon she finds her secret: kills two people (her old boyfriend and her protector) to protect her before her eyes. Even after he could not escape his feelings. They try to run but it's hart to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. He is caged; he is in a psychiatric hospital. They do not know anything about each other, but believes that they will save him. It reduces many obstacles but eventually gets. They run again but can't be infected. She is injured, she needs to rest, but the police almost look at them. We do not know what to do, they go into the corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopters around them, but there is no need for him, because he has already died in his hands, and he is the only man all over the world.
