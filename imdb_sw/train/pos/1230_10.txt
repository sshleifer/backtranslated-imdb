after seeing this film for the third time now I think it's almost the worst film of Adam PUNCH DRUNK love is bad in comparison with this you should say last when Dickie gets thrown into the boat is funny (hair is different from her and I love it when reducing each This film should be brought just like your true Sandler fan. <br /> <br /> The characters are poor in comparison with its lovely films like Waterboy, which has the same people in it (Peter Dante) who is one of the killers who are trying to kill Australian aircraft. <br /> <br /> This film lacks in detail with a good story story and should be less than 100
