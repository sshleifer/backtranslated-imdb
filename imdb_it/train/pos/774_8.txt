I think it's a good movie; I think it's a very Romanian film through the scenery and the atmosphere; I think he didn't mean to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a purpose); I think it's very natural; I think it's human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never made me think ... waw lame acting (I'm not Sean Connory & co) nor the film is a block film, I'm like the movie ... normal ppl that can act ...; I think the film has achieved its intention; I think it made me feel things (or hear them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed ... as far as I know.
