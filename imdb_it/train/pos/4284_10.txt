This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portraits of the mentality that seems to have once again pervaded the Balkans, 45 years after the time represented. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love together that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the most appropriate answer. The accuracy of the representation and the timelessness of the types, however, make a great film look if one wants to understand a little of what pushed the former Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomat in charge of the region should try to do something until they have seen this film, and its twin, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention that it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
