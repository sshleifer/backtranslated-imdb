Although I agree that it is a beautiful but not exceptional film, for many of the reasons that have mentioned other posters, I still enjoy it. One reason is music: I would like to call attention to the very beautiful appearance of the Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-organized nightclub scene. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their time, and they convincingly convince Jimmy Stewart's mind by playing a hysterical trumpet duet, a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. Even the Candolis played so well, although I suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them. I don't know much about George Duning, who takes credit for the music (apart from the fact that he seems to have worked with Three Stooges on more than one occasion), but the Candoli brothers' casting as a jazz warlock was a real nice touch .
