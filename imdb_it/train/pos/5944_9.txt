I'll say this to begin with: ... Why, oh, why, can't WB do what these short film directors do? Sandy is obviously an extraordinary director and deserves some credit from WB and DC. But I imagine they are a bit exaggerated when a man with a budget of $ 12,000 can make a superhero fan drool. The World's Finest is one of the best short films I've ever seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a brilliant choice. Let's face it, Superman is not a super-model. It may be nice, but a GQ Stud is not. And I don't know what that guy had any comments over me, but Superman is really quite muscular (have you ever read a Superman comic?). I suppose the fact alone is only trampling me ... It seems such an obvious choice to convince someone with actual muscle mass to play a Superhero rather than a pretty face. Same thing for Batman, Bartram is in incredible shape and an excellent Batman ... I don't know guys ... If I had a bigger budget, and his movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be Neck and Neck. In short, this is one of the few Superhero films with actors that actually WATCH the part. <br /> <br /> The Acting is also very nice. I don't know what everyone's talking about, O'Hearn's not so bad. It's damn convincing like Superman and Bartram ... well, he's Batman. I mean, come on people, this movie has a budget of $ 12,000 dollars, what did you expect? Everyone Else is also fantastic, except Two-Face seems a bit more crazy than usual ... But hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois is pretty hot too. <br /> <br /> SFXs are also incredibly sweet. I mean, seeing Superman lift the car ... MAN! How nice. Against the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I might have to put this on, since Mike really seems to be flying, and with ease. The flying sequences left something to be desired, but again, with a bigger budget ... Oh, and he even used a Batmobile! (It was probably a model, but it looked damn convincing). <br /> <br /> All in all, the only drawback of this trailer was the lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible director and NEEDS to be part of some kind of project ... But no, they (like most Marvel projects) will continue to receive these hack directors who don't show almost no regard for the fans and what interests him, and continues to churn out these gambling films. Thank God Superman Returns was a success, or that seriously would have been the end. World's Finest is excellent, and in my book it counts as a superhero movie.
