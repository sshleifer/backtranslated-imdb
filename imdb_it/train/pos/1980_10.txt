One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 the first time I saw this film, and it has always been a favorite since then. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the 1960s people who had been expressed in musicals had a musical talent (unlike a current musical named by CERTAIN Academy, based in a big city in the Midwest). All the main roles have been well cast ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (who fortunately has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as the Dodgers were fantastic. Mark Lester presents himself as an innocent waif, which was what Dickens meant when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers performing in "Consider yourself", "I would do anything" "Who will buy" and "Will be back soon", many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
