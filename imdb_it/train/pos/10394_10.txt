A magical journey created by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITLES of British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a cinematic masterpiece! Some of the most exciting early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and sparkling music by Miklos Rozsa along with Sabu's youthful exuberance, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and malevolent malice and June Duprez's exquisite beauty and voice like the princess all work wonderfully well. Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect script, which is appropriately grandiose. DON'T MISS THIS! Since I posted the comments above, I got the recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I had never seen the image correctly until I saw this DVD version. The clarity and resolution are so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was stunned surprising classic can be looked at again time and never fails to enchant and delight the viewer. Once again, MUST SEE!
