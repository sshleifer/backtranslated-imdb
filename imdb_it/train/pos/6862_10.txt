When people ask me why I like films so much, I usually say, "Did you see the sequence of art galleries in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" That scene alone, practically represents everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a director, it would be the kind of thing I'd like to do. "Pure cinema" is a way to describe this sequence and it is truly surprising to see how the entire film by director De Palma functions at the same high artistic frequency as that scene. It is a dream film, clever as hell, and with more enthusiasm and intelligence than a dozen films put together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a topic of discussion: can a film be based exclusively on technique and can it still be considered an artistic success? The film has no message to speak of, the acting is great but it is in the service of style and the script is short of logic. De Palma's film is a great example of how style, if properly managed, can support a feature film. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative shows, but this is a director's film until the disappearance. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the cinematographic medium. I won't tell you which Hitchcock movie the movie pays homage to (I don't want to spoil surprises), but I think De Palma transcends the arc of history, and manages to create a film that sums up his entire career. Not for the faint of heart!
