It is a pity that many people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But don't worry! I explain it too :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "Dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now what people didn't understand is that Tony's dream is more than a dream. in this episode he talks about his preparation for his death. He loses his identity and eventually forgets himself, so he disconnects all his bonds with this world. You'll notice what I'm saying in the doctor's scene, where Tony says he lost his briefcase that contains "his life". The producers have really done a great job interpreting their thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will find this and the next episode a unique thing, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> Like any episode of sopranos, acting and filming are superb. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't understand was what the role of the monks was. I'll see it until I get this. <br /> <br /> however this episode really touched me, and I don't think anyone else can have a better view of what happens in an almost death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 without a doubt.
