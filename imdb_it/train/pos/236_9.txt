It's a rare occasion where I want to see a movie again. "The Amati Girls" is a film of the genre. In the old cinemas I would have stayed for more shows. Was this story autobiographical for the writer / director? It has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> The cast of all the stars presents their characters in a credible and tender way. Who wouldn't want Mercedes Ruehl as a big sister? I loved his work for "Per Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most films, the conviction is suspended because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult to suspend this belief in "The Amati Girls". You feel such a part of this family! How I wanted to come in defense of Dolores when her family is suffocating her emotional life. And he wanted to cheer up Lee Grant by criticizing Cloris Leachman's hair color. Humor is not a humor to laugh at, but has a quality of well-being that satisfies much more than pendants and the like. <br /> <br /> The love that is portrayed in this family of cinema is to be emulated and loved. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the family name, Amati, translated from Italian means "loved ones".
