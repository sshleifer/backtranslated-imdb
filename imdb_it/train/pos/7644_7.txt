Jim Belushi is as exceptional as the "average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bartender who not only listens to Belushi's "story", but has a "cure" for all the problems of Belushi's middle class: a magic potion to provoke an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. <br /> <The flashbacks show a horribly shameful 15-year-old having caused the defeat of his High School baseball team championship. Belushi continues with his "pitiful life", apparently happy, but always wondering "and if ..." For what seems to be several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, of enormous success, admired and hated by others to an extent equal. <br /> <br /> It's not really "It's A Wonderful Life", but some elements are similar and very appealing. The "final" is predictable, but still satisfying. Look at a very young Cortney Cox in a part like "fatal attraction", like another woman. A very pleasant film!
