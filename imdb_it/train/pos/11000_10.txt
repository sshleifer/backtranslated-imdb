If you enter the movie with expectations, throw them away now, because no amount of hype will do justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> To classify this film into a single genre would be criminal. It is an espionage thriller, it has elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction and cyberpunk all tied together by an ingenious narrative plot, by twists to the mind and a splendid cinematography. <br /> <br /> A lot of the comments here are centered on it derived, both in good and bad terms, from other movies. But as they say, every Shakespeare tale, so once you get past this, you're in an infernal race. <br /> <br /> You will have to suspend disbelief in some places, and while the set never gets unbelievable, there are parts (read: the elevator) that suffer from a low budget and a little graphics poor. Do not misunderstand this to say that it is on the same level as the films on Sci-Fi type channels, though, because this is on a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you are willing to sit down and dedicate a good 90 minutes of your life to a new cinematic experience, by all means, FACE NOW! Watch this movie now before it becomes good to have seen it!
