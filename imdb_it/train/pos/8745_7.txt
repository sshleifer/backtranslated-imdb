After maturity, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to take a trip to Thailand. While there, they meet a charming Australian boy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. I agree. At the airport, however, they are arrested for drug trafficking and then sentenced to 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they have not done. Not really knowing what to do, they end up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. It is said that if you have the money it can help you. Things start well, but still can't get out. <br /> <br /> The film is really good because it doesn't let what happens happen and it's always interesting. But I couldn't believe the ending. It was one of those endings where 100% truth is unknown, but we still know what really happened with Nick and drug smuggling due to "possession" and so on. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both perform well here. Beckinsales' performance was a bit weak. The friendship between the two characters of Danes and Beckinsales is good, but it might seem stronger. Paul Walker also has a small unaccredited role here. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I gave it a 7/10.
