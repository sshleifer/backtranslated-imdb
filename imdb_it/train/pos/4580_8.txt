Princess Tam Tam is devoid of the trappings of racism, in the way we think of racism in the United States, but there are more subtle (for the American viewer) statements about ethnic identity over time. Pay attention to Alwina's (Baker) positioning within the shots, how it is addressed by the other characters, the settings that surround her and that everyone considers her a "wild" African and ask you if Alwina has any shreds of agency during the whole movie. I do not want to spoil anything, but in the end pay close attention, the dichotomy between "eastern" and "western" culture is offensive to say the least, this word is fortunately denied these days. The French have a checkered past as an imperial force in all the areas represented (see Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953 by Chris Marker) and pay attention to the places that European travelers visit while they are in Africa, and what they reflect about their attitudes towards '"other". I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker, much of what he has done in his professional career, as Princes Tam Tam, who is regressive is certainly overshadowed by his efforts towards integration, his spy work ( I am gushing, I'm sorry.) However the film is captivating to me because of its performance, as well as being a testament to a past mentality.
