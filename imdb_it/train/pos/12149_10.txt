I agree with another user here and I must say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I saw it as a child and loved it! The scaffolding scenes are fantastic and you can really empathize with this guy because he is treated as an outcast. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu that this movie sucks! If you like Kung Fu you'd like this one !!!
