I originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 on cable TV. What a surprise and joy! Everyone is secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays the role of "mental" don (does he remember the New York don who should have been schizophrenic? Does art imitate life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and NOT to have fun with! Demonstrating in this way that beauty and constitution go together! Then there is the big scene of "bullshit" between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) in which they recite the "crap" of the world orally. This film is both thin and bald. For all the shots, it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see different actors in their final or near-final role. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of word games and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert downloads this movie. It's completely wrong. THIS is a good movie! Maybe not just for Ebert. I consider it as a 10 because of how well done it is and how much fun the script can be, even if it's not really some kind of straight comedy movie. I like it so much that I bought it on DVD because it doesn't show much on cable TV. Now it's all mine!
