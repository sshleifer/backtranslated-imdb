I only saw the first series on DVD, but I would summarize The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a script similar to Tarantino. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (so not a "10"), and much better than all of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is a lot of action, partly rather bloody, the plot is character-driven. Some of the minor characters also contribute to great narrative lines; for example. the relationship (or lack) of the priest with Carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and with Christopher and his weak friend (who didn't last very long (candidate for the Darwin award?) <br /> <br /> In addition to plot, script and acting, I liked the other reasons; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomato sauce 2. Music. 3. Show that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
