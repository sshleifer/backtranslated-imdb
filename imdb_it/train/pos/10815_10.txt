Now, many would think of staying away from this film just for the title. If you don't have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed a video of a friend of mine and I immediately fell in love with this movie. This film is full of amazing gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add to an incredible viewing experience! If you are a lover of quality experiences, then by all means, watch this great movie!
