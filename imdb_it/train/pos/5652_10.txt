I love the series! Many of the stereotypes that portray the Southerrners as hicks are very obvious, but such people exist too often. Even the portrait of the government of the South sounds too true, but the friendly characters also remember one of the many positive things of the South. Some things never change and we see "good old boys" every day! There's a Lucas Buck in every southern city that just needs to make a phone call to make things happen, and the "little white trash" storybook is all too familiar. Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern south! Somehow I think Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
