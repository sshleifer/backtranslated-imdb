Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, take a trip to Thailand for one last experience before parting and going to college. It seems like a fun time to visit an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them on a trip to Hong Kong and puts the drugs in their luggage. They are caught by local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is the main plot of "Brokedown Palace" and it was good. The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations. In reality, the representation was rather mild, as the prison conditions are often much worse than those depicted. It serves as a reminder that no matter how badly we think our judicial system is, it is pristine compared to much of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were too many situations invented in the film that hindered the story. The entire escape attempt was a fake fantasy. To think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into a prison with a padded bra, and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything that was carried by visitors, assumed that the guards or spectators were real whims. <br /> <br /> History cannot even close the annoying question of how drugs got into Alice's backpack (Claire Danes). Did he really agree to carry the drugs? We are left to guess. It was intriguing to be guessed about girls' innocence throughout the film, but we finish the film without really knowing if one or both girls could be guilty. Apart from this significant defect, the finish was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /> <br /> The acting of Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done. Danes, who has been hypervasculated and hypnotized, actually came as an actor in this film. Although his portrait was often immature (like his character), he improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more disastrous. Beckinsale, on the other hand, is flying under her radar throughout her short career and shines like the two beautiful shoes that suddenly find herself in prison. His was the best interpretation of the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was a mixture like the lawyer. His ironic and wary style is an advantage in movies like "While you were sleeping", but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the tourist in Thailand was interesting, but it didn't make me want to go there. <br /> <br /> Overall, a funny movie made implausible in some parts by the inclusion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave a 7/10.
