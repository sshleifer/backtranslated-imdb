I liked this movie and had very low expectations due to all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious about what all the fuss was about because some of the posts were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans. Oh, and it's from Korea that he released some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies, so you can make sense of my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It was not confused as everyone said and the monsters were beautiful and the battles were great. There are some holes in history but it doesn't matter. I have a sort of fine tuning of things like that and I stopped asking why so long ago, when I see the summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the things of reincarnation were different, and I thought that the main characters dressed suspiciously as Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's (Behr) hair looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better and I hope that in the future Korea, with its unusual sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, can bring diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
