Dog days is one of the most accurate movies I've ever seen describing life in modern cities. In some places it is very hard and cruel and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, desperation, deep emotional dead ends, problems, perversion, complexes, madness. All the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today. It makes you understand once again the pitiful state in which people have guided society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of city life has never been properly depicted on the screen. I just wish it were a lie. Unfortunately it is not. So ... 10/10.
