Woah! It's something I can say about this movie. Personally I am one of those people who love cats, so it would have been a big inconvenience for the film, but I liked how everyone's cats got their revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady in a very irresistible way, I suppose lust got the better of me while watching this movie . <br /> <br /> There was one thing that was disappointed. I saw Charmed first and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really badly compared to the scenes of his kiss with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it's because Krause and Combs have a great chemistry or maybe a little more, this was the only disappointment in the film, but I think it's He was compensated with Brian Krause in those tight jeans he wore in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs, her heavenly husband and her son's father, your in for a big surprise with this movie, she didn't look like a distressing boy. Even if I think about it now, it would be nice to see the character of Krause on Charmed conquered by evil making him like his in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I must also say that the music was GREAT in this film too!
