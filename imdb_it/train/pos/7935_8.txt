Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to live even before the opening credits began. First, any play on "... of the living dead" invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and immediately establishes a high standard to which many films cannot afford to aspire. And secondly, my film-watching partner professed the doubt that any urban horror film would pass the seminal Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptical, we settled down to watch. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and kind-hearted zombie movie. Oh sure, the budget is low, and of course the amateur friends of the directors populate the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it's cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a laboratory during the day and as a surrogate parent of his younger brother during the night. He dreams of moving from Oakland. However, before this planned escape, his brother is shot to death in a drive-by. Ricky's acute scientific mind presents a superior option to CPR or 911: injections of his laboratory's experimental regenerative formula. Unfortunately, little brother wakes up in an ambulance like an Oakland bloodthirsty zombie! Chaos and chaos! I think it's cheaper to eat your enemies than take revenge on a drive-by, but then again, I'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life. (How poor is a judge? In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I thought of "Ah-ha! White T-shirts on everyone so the blood shows up. Inexpensive! I used the same technique in my horror film at low budget "Jordan replied," No, this is a group suit, the white shirts have been banned from bars in New Orleans for a period of time. "Oh.) <br /> <br /> Much of the film is set in someone's living room, so there's a lot of going out and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are nice and the film is sincere ... it exceeds its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Explanation of the zombies: when the man plays God, the zombies arise! Or maybe: follow the test rules approved by the FDA before human trials! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the zombie canon: this is the first zombie movie I saw with a shooting. As for the actual zombies, the infection spreads normally, but the rather unusual head shots don't work, it's the heart shots that kill. Zombies have impulses, the absence of which proves true death. And these zombies emit very beautiful jaguar-snarl sounds. <br /> <br /> Free zombie movie in-joke: a mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Zombie favorite: zombie jaguar younger brother, of course!
