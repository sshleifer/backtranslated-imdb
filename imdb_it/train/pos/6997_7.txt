One thing is certain ... you shouldn't watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who must live with a sin that he cannot handle. The plot has been fed to you rather than the usual stupid explanation, so it makes you think about what's going on. In the end the points are united and the performance makes sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith made another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that there are many moral questions to ask, but if you accept and buy in his agony, then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey that takes you is quite interesting, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the genre in which you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.
