CREEP is a serious and direct horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to show people being attacked in an empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. And it does just that. Nothing more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith draws the drama as plausibly as possible by introducing a series of characters who would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it was blocked. It also leaves vaguely purposely vague the origins of the titled Creep (the illicit experiments that occur in the 60s in the underground are mentioned) and that bit of mystery works for the most part. Sadly, it blows towards the end actually holding back from a twisting ending where more genetic malformations appear (they are also mentioned). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a twisted clich√© ending! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Powerful is as good as the terrified female protagonist and the rest of the cast is fine.
