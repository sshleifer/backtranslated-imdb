I just saw him recently, after an interval of almost forty years. It holds good, especially the exceptional songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who will buy" with his magic counterpoint, just one of the many highlights.) <br /> <br /> I disagree with the other post that criticized his G score. The rating system, brand new at the time, he had never intended that the G (General) rating meant "completely free of conflict". <br /> <br /> Characterizing it as unfit for children reminds me of the description I once saw of The Wizard of Oz: a girl arrives in an unknown land and kills the first person she meets. Then he goes on a trip with three male companions and kills again.
