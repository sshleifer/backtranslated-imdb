This film is simply fun. I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another attempt, but better than Band camp and The naked mile, at least more fun. <br /> <br /> Right after the first five minutes I was laughing out loud, so I decided to call my friend and watch him together. We had some beer and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find deep messages in this film, but it is worth watching. <br /> <br /> So relax and have fun.
