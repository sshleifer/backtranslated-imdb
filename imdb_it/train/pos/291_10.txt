Zombie Chronicles is not something to scream at, it is obvious that it is not an award-winning film, but it is a fun B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood, which was another fun low-budget movie. Acting is as bad as most low-cost movies, but that's what makes it more fun, zombie makeup is beautiful and effective especially with the budget, gore is also big and gross, the film is a bit like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt, since we have two stories about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and let you guess especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some cheap zombie movies, if you like cheap B movies or zombie movies made little by little, then check out Zombie Chronicles.
