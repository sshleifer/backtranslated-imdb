This film is banned in almost all foreign countries I can think of. The Japanese people (?) Who plays in this film must have been really desperate for a job, or we're just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three thugs torture the hell of a helpless woman, they use all kinds of things to kill her, burn her, kick her, run around in a chair (over 200 times!) , they use the torture of sound (forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It doesn't sound bad at all, but it can drive you crazy). They throw guts (probably from an animal) at her while the shes are thrown out, and she enjoys herself when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finale the BIGGEST EYEBALL TORTURE I HAVE EVER SEEN! <br /> <br /> If you've never heard of these films and you watch one without knowing that it's a simulated sniffed movie, you'll think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak out and get sick! As I said pure underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gorro. If you don't strongly recommend reading the series before looking! From the point of view of the gore, the shock and the creativity he earns a 10, but from the plot and from all that is 1. A classic underground ... <br /> <br /> My final grade is 8 / 10 br /> <br />
