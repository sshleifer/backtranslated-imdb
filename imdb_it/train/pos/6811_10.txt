Although I generally don't like remakes believing that remakes are a waste of time; this film is an exception. Actually I didn't know it until I read the previous comment that it was a remake, so my opinion is purely about the real movie and not about a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written is no question: it's Capote. No more words needed. <br /> <br /> The game of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb. I've seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors and, in Eric's case, I always wondered why his sister was the number one star and not his brother. This time this certainty is raised to the fact, no doubt. His way of playing, as well as Mr. Edwards's play, is clearly the first of all their work. I recommend this film to be among the 50 best films to see and keep on DVD shelves.
