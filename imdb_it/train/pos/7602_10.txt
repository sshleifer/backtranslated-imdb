The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​them adapting to the island, while the mysteries were explored (and seen) was simply phenomenal; full of suspense, tons of cliffhangers and a surprising plot. I mean, I love the idea of ​​seeing them just getting used to the island. And then seeing the smoke monster in the first episode caught my attention. From that moment on I was conquered. The second season was right in season 1, just a little better. I loved the idea of ​​hatches and the DHARMA initiative. The whole plot and the sequences of season 2 were mysterious, gruesome and exciting. I loved all the suspense surrounding the others on the island, but the history of DHARMA made the second season really special. <br /> <br /> The third season was not as good as the 1 and 2 ... but still, excellent. I loved seeing others' hidden stories, seeing their field and seeing the mysteries explored further. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, although not so good, was still breathtaking and fun, but above all exciting! Now, the fourth season. I had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes are good, but then REALLY started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot became old after the first couple episodes ... and MUCH OF EVERYONE .... Season 4 was torn away from something that made LOST a perfect series: the mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone ) and general excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.
