Broadway and actor-director-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby) creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. He plays Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and c 'is a cameo by Peter Falk. The movie premise: An old stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands) re-evaluates her life after a dark fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The film has a slow rhythm and a dark, moody and scary quality. It has a cinematic look from the 60s and also reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are those that every successful actress has - is aging and will become useless in her career. Furthermore, he feels he has lived a life that lacks true spirituality, humanity and merit. He lived only for his career - he has no children, he does not do charitable actions, etc. The gradual disintegration of his personality is the flesh of this film. It's falling apart. You are in crisis. Gena Rowlands really enters the tormented suffering of the character and plays the part quite well. She is a formidable actress and this film from the 1970s stands in stark contrast to the often violent films of the period and the catastrophic films or adventure thrillers. It is a film with many deep emotions but it has a cold and cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream films and actors of the 70s generation. Either this or this film is a product of the 1970s that was cynical in many ways - the deception of Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not exceptional, and this film is not well known, it is a very disturbing film with disturbing moods. Congratulations to the underrated director Cassavetes who died in the late 1980s.
