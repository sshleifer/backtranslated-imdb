I first read Pearl S Buck's wonderful novel in my third grade history class, and I enjoyed every thrilling page. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would take it and, considering it was created in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Some things must be accepted: in 1937 it was not a question of merging Asian actors in a great Hollywood movie. In a sense, this makes the final product more interesting than if it were able to use a more authentic-looking cast. <br /> <br /> With that obstacle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to choose a splendid and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the height of his powers as an actor during this period and could almost play anything he thought of. Once the trick is passed (it's good, but nobody will trade it for a Chinese), his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then there's Luise Rainer. Having won the Oscar the previous year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the Viennese actress's star was on the rise and was given the role of O-lan plum despite her lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance earned her a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history. <br /> <br /> Many criticisms were made of Rainer's performance and his Academy Award here. It has been called wood and monotonous. There is a small grain of truth in this. HOWEVER, that said, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, though not a Chinese, he played O-lan practically when Buck wrote it; it is indeed a splendid display and one of the best screen book transfers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, well, this was MGM. They had the biggest roster of actors and actors in Hollywood at the time, and a big budget to pay the best, and they finally got the best. <br /> <br /> The film softens Wang Lung's marriage with O-lan a little. In the novel, the passions of the flesh come with wealth and he takes on a concubine, a move that devastates his wife, but his feelings as a woman do not concern him. In the film, a contrite Wang Lung returns to his wife on his deathbed the two pearls he had taken years before, realizing too late that she was his true love. <br /> <br /> Corny, yes. But this is Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they clashed with, the film could have opened up to screams of laughter. But despite the notable lack of real Asians in the cast, this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years. In fact, the most surprising thing about this film is how beautiful it is, when it could easily have been a disaster.
