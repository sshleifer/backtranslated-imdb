1st seen 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): A well-told tale of farmers in China and their rise to the fore and struggles with what Mother's nature throws at them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and tells a family that begins with the arranged marriage of the child with a slave. The film does a good job in maintaining your interest despite a rather friendly performance by the protagonist played by Paul Muni. It is chronicle, Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and how the earth works, buys more land, eventually it becomes very rich but then returns to the land where it originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the common thread of the story (in addition to the earth itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors it does a good job of showing the country and its people. It is obvious that MGM used his money to create a really good epic with this at a time when they probably could afford it. The scene with the grasshoppers is done very well and the rest of the film looks really good and deserves the award for best photography at that year's Oscars. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and has developed quite well.
