At first I wasn't sure if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I guess given the production time it was a mix of all three. <br /> <br /> Let us assume that the dramatic plot was rather predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be interesting scenes while the movie went on. We were able to witness what appeared to be a realistic training regimen and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this film came together for me it was closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I perceived it) that I didn't often encounter before. You could put yourself into action and imagine the thoughts of the young fighters. This has been mixed with the usual problems of portraying Japanese soldiers passable at a time when one might think that the real Japanese actors would be a little scarce. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent as a source of the state of American mentality in 1943 as the war fought with Japan. Also of interest was an excavation of the Japanese regarding the help that the United States has given to Japan in past years.
