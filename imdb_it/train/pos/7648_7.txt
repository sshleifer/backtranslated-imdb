I admit I have a soft spot for alternative story stories, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY at 12:01. Among those great is this little gem. It is rather difficult to overcome MR. DESTINY without giving a nod of appreciation to all the cast members, from the good heart of James Belushi to the murderer Courtney Cox. This film lacks gravity and size to make it a fantastic movie, but it's a nice recoil on a rainy afternoon. It is also a great rental for an inexpensive date.
