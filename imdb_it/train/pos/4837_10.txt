I was a young film student in 1979, when the Union of Soviet filmmakers arrived in Sofia Bulgaria and made Konchalovsky's first "Siberiade"; "Stalker" by Tarkosvky and Danelia "An autumn marathon". I was amazed by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 epic hours and was speechless. Much better than Bertolucci's "1900". Far! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow get the negative and make "the full length restored version of the director" one day! On DVD, of course! I also fought fiercely in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating Soviet cinema with bad taste! Time is on my side.
