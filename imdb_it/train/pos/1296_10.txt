It is an extremely difficult film to watch, in particular because it addresses the deepest core of all our lives. But in the end it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Whoever finds it cynical, I must say that they must have missed much of the meaning of the entire message of the film. For those who actually watch the film, they will see that the way problems are dealt with is absolutely necessary, and the result is ultimately uplifting. Of course, it is very difficult to look at, a difficult and even brutal topic. Yet it is extremely relevant to society and everyone. It shows the peak of what world cinema is doing right now (I will not limit this term only to France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is better to enter with a shiny head without being influenced by conflicting visions and let the film work for you.
