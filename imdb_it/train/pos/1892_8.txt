After seeing Arthur on TV many times I laughed so hard that the role of Dudley Moore as Arthur a happy drunk millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant / father Hobson was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and saw it, despite the passage of almost 27 years, the role of Liza Minnelli is even more enjoyable than ever because the love interest was fascinating: the chemistry between the two was magical. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire who has a bill that reads like the public debt that doesn't want to grow and enjoys acting like a child. His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud) it seems that nobody really cares about Arthur, except for him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry the frightening blonde socialite Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four weeks will cut his son's legacy by $ 750 million. <br /> <br /> However, Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young maid of the working class and a thief of ties, now faces a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and interrupts him with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep both the money and his true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for everyone
