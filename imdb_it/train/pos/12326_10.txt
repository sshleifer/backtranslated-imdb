I saw this movie before at the Berlin Festival, and I had never seen Hong Kong cinema before. I felt sitting on a roller coaster: the action was so fast and there was no boring moment for the whole film. He has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes that underline the film's extraordinary musical component. This film is absolutely a must !!
