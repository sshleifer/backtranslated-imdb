The intelligent, elegant and compelling thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is firmly placed among his best films! <br /> <br /> When the struggling housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins a prostitute to uncover the murderer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill has left a strong impression on the public of its time and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setting and develops into a heart-rending mystery filled with strong suspense. The ending and the conclusion are particularly "nightmare". It's a real limit for your seat. Even more impressive is the elegant direction by De Palma which gives this film not only a tense tension but a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but above all in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also gives a beautiful soundtrack to the film. <br /> <br /> Casting is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain makes an exceptional turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is as wonderful as the unfortunate housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an involved street walker is solid. Even a young Keith Gordon proves to be a worthy supporter of his investigating son. <br /> <br /> Many criticize De Palma's films for elements of Hitchcock and this film was no exception. But any similarity between the works of Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, because to define this film a "rip-off" would be degrading for a good thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** ****
