Cult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who could have guessed that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, films that had been discredited by critics and the public upon their release, would have become immensely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike most of those who hated Envy (evidenced by a bad rating of 4.4), I found Envy as one of the funniest films of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is ridiculous. The dialogue is not intelligent, the scenes have little continuity and the script seems to be written by a fourth grade student. But that's exactly why the movie is so funny. See, to appreciate the accidental genius of Envy, you have to enjoy the film from an ironically detached point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love envy? Because the film is bad to the point that it becomes good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and envy certainly fits the bill.
