I like it for my recent personal experience. Above all the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is over. The studio characters did not like their "real" lives, but they enjoyed themselves, that is what they were. The film did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a handsome stranger and a beautiful European city, but certainly about the deepest discussion about their life values. Many films are so in terms of discussing the definitions of life or love or current relationships or problems in life or in some way of those. Before Sunrise confronts him in a nice way, this causes the viewer to stop and think and adjust the breath and keep watching the movie. Before Sunrise did not attempt to instill a specific thought in your head. He simply encouraged you to think about some problems in everyday life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical complaining complaints or stupid ideas that flowed. You would continue to think of those problems for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not important at all, after all. You could have something from the outside and feel something good or positive about you after the movie. Movies should be fun. This is a fun movie and it's worth your time to watch it. I'm traveling too. The film somehow represented a part of me and answered some of my questions.
