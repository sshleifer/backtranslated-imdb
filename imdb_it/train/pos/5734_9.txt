I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, because he offers viewers moving images that are absolutely unique with the typical "Lynch elements". Having seen most of his work, I naively thought I could foresee Lynch's next step. I was completely wrong. Dumbland is something I never imagined under the name of David Lynch. However, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to reflect on this extremely primitive character, and I concluded that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here reflect the pieces of reality, emphasizing them distorting them. There are things in our lives that almost never emphasize, because they are disgusting or horrible, however, they surround us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these pieces. This is not a film to be enjoyed, even if sometimes you laugh at a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all the things that we rather refuse to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you must not like it. It exists only. And finally, if you're careful enough, you'll also find typical Lynch elements. I recommend it to tolerant people !!!
