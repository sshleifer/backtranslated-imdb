This film is always a favorite of all time. Only a pretentious and humorless idiot would not like this wonderful film. This movie looks like a slice of warm apple pie topped with French vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best work ever and his most credible performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks and an enviable figure. Whether you like singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely left its mark on the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as a naturally gifted actress? It is above the so-called "stars" of today's cinema. Cher is a true actor at the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, in the sense that he never seems to "act", he really becomes the character in a convincing way. He more than deserved the respect of his peers and of the film audience. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful: the characters, the scenery, the dialogue, the food. I never tire of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at the scene where everyone is sitting around the dining table at Rose's house, I pause the remote control to see exactly what delicious Rose food is serving. I saw spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but can't tell if they're eating ravioli, ziti? What is the main course? It looks wonderful and it's driving me crazy! <br /> <br /> Everyone in that family was hard-working people who respected and cared for one another. The grandfather was not set aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He also looked like a pretty healthy and independent old coward. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was not "just a housewife", she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother and house manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen, but did not allow her to define who she was. High-level businessmen are not as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini. Notice the cheeky way he said "I didn't have children until I was 37. It's not over until it's over." You have the feeling of being the kind of young woman who did exactly what she wanted and made her way without the other person understanding what had happened. He was charming, quick and very intelligent. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> Actually I didn't like Loretta very much because she seemed a bit of a pundit who wasn't really adventurous and in control of herself as she wanted others to think. He could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but he didn't really apply common sense to his life. He was about to marry a middle-aged boy, simply because he wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose in his life. He was more conventional than his mother. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron in a detention house and seemed without humor and bored, but underneath you felt that she was vulnerable and alone and had a lot of love to give to the right man. He'll probably end up doing a fantastic mom too. <br /> <br /> I could see in the future a house full of loud and screaming children from Loretta and Ronnie and Rose and Cosmo who enjoy every minute.
