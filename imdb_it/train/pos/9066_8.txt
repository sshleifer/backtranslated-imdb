~~ I was able to watch this movie yesterday morning on an initial viewing pass ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of 2 children, ranging from 11 to 6. So I'm sure many parents can relate to having to see many films "for children". This was nice for me. I didn't read this particular book, so I don't know if it remained faithful to the book or not. But it certainly brought the coarseness factor to a high level. This is the story of the "new" boy in the city and it only happens that there is a group of guys who have trained in a club and love to choose children ... does it look familiar? We haven't all suffered this time or the other. He has the little brother he can't stand and his parents are embarrassed about. The thing I liked most was to see how each character was totally different from another. The bully (why do they always make the bully a red head? My daughter has red hair! And she is not a bully! .. lol) is a big bully, who finds himself screaming from his older brother. It took twists and you fall in love with them all and really find yourself routing for all the characters! Even the parents, a great bond between father and son. All in all pleasant, sweet, funny, gross, etc. ...... Take your children !!! You will like it as much as they do!
