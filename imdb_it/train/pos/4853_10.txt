I have a thing for the old black and white movies of this type, the films of Will Hay and Abbot & Costello, especially those that are my favorites. I chose this film on DVD because it used the same idea as "Oh Mr Porter" by Will Hay, which is one of the best comedies ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie ended at 12:45). I find that films of this type, to be done with Ghost Trains, etc., are best seen at night with the lights turned off. In this way you enter the plot more and night vision works well with this film. <br /> <br /> The jokes of the film may seem a little dated to some viewers, I guess it depends on the viewer. But they are not dated to me. I'm 28 years old and although I'm not old enough to have been around when this movie was released (my father was though). I still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this type. Sitting in the room in front of the TV with some snacks and drinks and relaxing and relaxing at night while watching these films, not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this. It's an escape from reality for a while. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the movie (with a black mustache) appears at about three-quarters of the movie after his car crashed and is looking for a woman who was followed to the station. This man was in the Will Hay classic "The Ghost of St Michaels". I thought I would report it if no one noticed it :) <br /> <br /> The pieces of the film are very suggestive. Outside the abandoned station it looks good and as if there were no soul for miles in every direction, and the inside of the station is very welcoming, looking away from the rain storm outside. I felt like I would have liked to have been in the film with the cast. The atmosphere of this film is something that is missing in many films now. It keeps you glued from the moment the movie starts until it ends. <br /> <br /> We need more of this type of film in today's market. But unfortunately it could be looked at in favor of films with nudity and imprecation and crude humor. This sort of cinematic era (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) For me it's the golden age of cinema!
