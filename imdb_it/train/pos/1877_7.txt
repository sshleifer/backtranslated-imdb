Arthur Bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people "under him" in the social field - he pays a prostitute in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter. <br /> <br /> He drinks a lot too, and sometimes drives while drinking, which of course is not fun, ever. <br /> <br /> The film is great, but even behind the comedy there is a bit of reality. John Gielgud cleans the floor with everyone else on the screen and creates a character for centuries. Let's talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but his Gielgud as "Hobson" will remember you more.
