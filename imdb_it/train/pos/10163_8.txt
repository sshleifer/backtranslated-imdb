This was a good story ... it had a good rhythm and all the characters were developed. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best I've seen it in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> The character of Jason Bigg was the best however. <br /> <br /> Even though it was small, it was ingeniously created from the beginning. /> <br /> This could be a romantic comedy and I don't like it better, but the script, the direction, the execution, the sound, the design in general in all its capacities were really very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film got a fairly high score compared to all the films I have seen in recent times - and the rest was on a big budget or better publicized. <br /> <br /> Good work in writing.
