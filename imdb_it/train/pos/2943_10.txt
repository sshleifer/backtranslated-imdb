I think this is still the best routine. There are others, like Rock's "bring the pain", and Allen "Men are Pigs" which are hilarious; "Damon Waynes latest stand" is also fun in tears - but this routine has no errors. All the jokes are fun and the 70 minute time limit is perfect. Just enough to last 20 years. I love the way it allows the public to be totally itself and without restrictions. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who has seen Jim Carrey grow a lot, watching a more relaxed comic is really nice. Do not include a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can look at if you are bloated. Thanks Eddie, God bless you.
