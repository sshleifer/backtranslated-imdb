"The Lady from Shanghai" is well known as one of Hollywood's most troubled productions. Welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut into ribbons. This made it even more difficult to keep track of the already mysterious story of the mystery. They posted a good deal of his dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and dubbing is all too obvious and badly done. The most disastrous of all, Welles and his screen and the protagonist of real life Rita Hayworth were falling apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes to the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this is overtaken by how fantastic Orson Welles's direction is. It makes the film incredibly elegant and atmospheric - every scene seems to be breathing from the screen. Furthermore, the characters and scenes are so bizarre that they border on the dream and the surreal. This sense of strangeness elevates scenes that are often found in these films, such as court sequences in the middle. I usually find the dramas of courtrooms boring, but Welles' bizarre direction and touches make them just as fascinating as all the rest. The end to the carnival almost resembles David Lynch. <br /> <br /> Even the acting here is very good. Despite their bankruptcy relationship, Welles and Hayworth both give decent performances - however their interactions are just a bit lacking. All the others are superb and delightful to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The lady of Shanghai" obviously has problems, but it is worth looking only to see one of the masters of cinema at its best. (8/10)
