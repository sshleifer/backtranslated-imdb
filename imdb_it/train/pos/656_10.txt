Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been extremely hard on Alexandre. Neither Marie nor Veronika ever seemed particularly sorry to keep Alexandre, being only a little intelligent though not at all intellectual, like most of us, no matter how difficult anyone can admit. Alexandre gets along perfectly with life, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing it, Veronika loves sex, Marie is her protector. is there anything wrong with this? is anyone in love? really? I don't think so. Although the New Wave French cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it's simply wonderful because of its lack of a plot to create emotions. The facility is perfect and anyone in Alexandre's position in an urban area can ask. Am I looking for a patron, someone interested?
