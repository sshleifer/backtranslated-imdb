I looked forward to the opening of this film for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he would turn into Seinchon Grinch and make the character his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film was pure magic. Carrey is a master of his trade and no one could have played this role perfectly as he did. There was a lot to be enjoyed by both adults and children, and this film will surely become a timeless classic that everyone will appreciate in the years to come. I already have visions of my little daughter sitting from year to year to watch this remake on video, and I will undoubtedly watch her and laugh as I did the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film wrote Jim Carrey everywhere, and I don't think he would have come together without him. However, the supporting cast was fascinating and fun in their genre, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect support for Carrey's antics. The set design, the musical score and the costumes have lent their hands to a magical and fabulous finished product and I believe that all those interested can be proud. <br /> <br /> It is not an easy feat to turn a 22-minute cartoon classic into a live action movie, but Howard has succeeded with flying colors. For those critics who disagree, maybe it's your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.
