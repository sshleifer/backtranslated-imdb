"Tintin and I" hit me for the first time as a masterpiece documentary. Photography and editing are truly breathtaking (almost anti-Dogma). We follow Tintin's life in Hergé's drawer through an open-heart interview in 1971. The Tintin series was designed against the backdrop of the great ideological struggles of the 20th century. In the midst of these Hergé has his demons to fight with, and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame them and escape into a world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Although there are spectacular photographs of drawings from Tintin's albums and even some reconstructions and reading passages from the albums, Hergé's story is told entirely through interviews and archival material, and never through reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived the turbulent life of a true suffering artist. But the fantastic world that came from his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
