Peter O'Toole is a pleasure to look at in roles where the jokes he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken astonishment. The adorable Susannah York offers a great contribution to the dramatic presence of O'Toole. <br /> <br /> The film alludes to incest - without a single explicit scene - but is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. Although this is not an important film from any point of view, he will be remembered for his entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the documents at the end, is a pleasure to watch, silently exuding the tragedy. The possible weakness here is Thompson's relaxed direction. But the film fluctuates because of the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I have seen the film twice over a period of 20 years - on both occasions with the name "Brotherly Love". "Country dance" is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this film, wherever it was released as such.
