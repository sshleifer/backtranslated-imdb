This film seems to draw a limit - on the one hand, those who adore it, on the other, those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> To begin with, there is a lot of comedies in this film that many viewers are not "getting". Obviously the Li's Mask jet resembles Bruce Lee's Kato - it's expected, it's a joke. The guy who has a time bomb sewn into his heart - outrageous? sure, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask, if this film should be so funny, why all the excessive and bloody violence? Well, first of all the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; and while the Hong Kong public would recognize that this violence is extreme, it is certainly only slightly above average for an HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes the conventions and thrusts of a genre to extremes, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of watching people shoot without obvious injuries, many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch shed blood everywhere. But the fact is, when you shoot fast metal bullets, it's almost certain that the blood will splash out, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This film is a Chinese comic film. It is true that the Spiderman films have never been so bloody, but if they were true to reality, they would have been! Well, despite its comic-book origins, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is flashy, overly stylized footage and modifications. If the creators of this film had shot it with an eye on Hollywood nostalgia (like, for example, The Rocketeer, or the recent Captain Sky movie), I doubt anyone would find it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it is, I had a lot of fun watching this movie.
