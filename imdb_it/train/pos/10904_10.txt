The most moving documentary and truly open to the eye ever created. I cried all the way, from beginning to end. Watching the show you are immediately captivated by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we ​​take for granted. The first time I listened to the title, I was almost afraid to see the program, for me it was difficult to understand living in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny chooses his coffin. Could you imagine doing it? Even more, even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain, he still opened his charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the few people who deserves respect and admiration, it's the definition of a model, which a true and undeniable hero has been!
