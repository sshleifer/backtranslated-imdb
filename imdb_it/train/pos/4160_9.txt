A word can describe this film and it is strange. I recorded this film one day because it was Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well, the film is about a guy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the road he meets very colorful characters and in the end he has to decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation / science fiction you may want to check this.
