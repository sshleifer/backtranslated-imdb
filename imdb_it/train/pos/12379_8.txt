I was an usher in an old theater in northern California when this movie came out. As good as it is on DVD, it's even more dismal and terrifying on the big screen. Even though it's been about 9 years since I saw it, it's still one of my all-time favorites. At the risk of sounding trivial, "They just don't make them that way anymore!" If Sixth Sense scared you completely, this movie is definitely for you! Great plot, incredible cast of characters, disturbing setting; even the soundtrack has a haunting quality. I strongly advise you not to watch it yourself. What a brownstone apartment was renting only for 1977 will leave you breathless (it would be at least 10 times that price today).
