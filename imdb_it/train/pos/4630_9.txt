This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, also plays a minor role in this film. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them back and forth - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is a kind of Friends / Sex in the City that happens (mostly gay), and everyone just wants the war to end so they can get on with their lives in peace. <br /> <br /> But, that is the massage. No matter how many posters you have published or how many raves for the peace you have, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring the two parts on the table, but they just want to keep doing it for whatever reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both here and in the United States, who only want everything and do not consider peace. There are many Palestinians who apparently would be out of work if peace ever comes. It is not in anyone's interest to end this war, and children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always in your mind as you watch this fun and engaging movie. It won't go away. You know something tragic is about to happen and, of course, it does. With the feelings of both sides running strong and revenge as a motivator, the tragedy always happens, and this is what makes this adult version of Friends / Sex in the City. There is no superficiality. It's real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.
