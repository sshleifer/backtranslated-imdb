First of all, Riget is wonderful. A good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Beautiful combination of strange "dogma" style to tell the story along with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no "end". For me it is unacceptable. I was thinking ... how will it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have some ideas. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the third part without Helmer wouldn't be the same. So here's my suggestion. Maybe a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not do a little experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create animations animated by puppets (such as "team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even 3d computer animations. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle I think it could work ... just so you can make the actors alive again. For Riget fans this should not be a big difference - if the animation is performed correctly, the average observer will consider it normal only after the first shots of the film. The most important thing now is history. It is quite understandable that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with actors nowadays. So why not play with the animation? And ... look for the possibilities it gives you! Even the marketing one! The great director ends his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Only dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 one day or even just see the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and how I expect it - everyone here does it. <br /> salutes, slaj <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about Stephen King's "hospital" kingdom ;-)
