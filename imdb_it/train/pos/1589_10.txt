I love this show. I look at all the replicas every day even though I saw all of them as 6 s each. <br /> <br /> They are two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly goes to live with Val when their dad is moved to Japan. Val has the perfect life, has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment on the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems of Vall and Holly. the main problem is the boys, but it also concerns responsibility and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and totally free, while Val is the complete opposite. She is organized must have a plan to do any kind of person. <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
