Romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? You will see one that is really rich and you think you want something more realistic. So, you'll see a realistic one, but it might be too boring to keep yourself interested. Or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but can't make you smile. Romantic comedies are difficult films. You assist them with many expectations and, usually, if you like it is only a question of whether the filmmakers anticipated your expectations or those of the boy or girl next to you. <br /> <br />, if you have a girlfriend next to you and you are a guy like me, you probably don't care so much if the movie is good, you have other things on your mind. For you, I say "Go get it, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say "See _A Guy Thing_". Is very funny. <br /> <br /> Why _A Guy Thing_ knows you are going into this movie with expectations, so he does not pretend that his "Boy who is getting married meets the woman of his dreams and is not his wife!" the plot will make all happy. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't sound real, or you think it's cruel. _ Guy Thing_ covers it. What _T Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best support cast I've seen in a long time, so if it's not the main storyline, you still have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> If we are talking about the veteran experts on the big screen and the big screen, like Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner ( Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty), or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we're talking about a group of very talented and capable actors who know exactly how to exploit the inspired characterization of the film, steal the show from time to time, and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies of these times. <br /> <br /> And this is not to diminish the real romance and the stars that carry it forward, because Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) is very sweet and terrible done well. young professional whose life could escape control, and Selma Blair shows a discreet genius in portraying the aspiring socialite and the sophisticated career woman that every guy wants to marry except for the guy that he actually is. <br /> <br /> Much of the film's success, however, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and wears it well. Not since then, damn, I don't know when, I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that made her fall in love with her so easily. Of course, it's all in close-ups, in the voice and subtle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the main reasons why we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles's slightly unconventional sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity. This is a film that depicts a broken world of irreconcilable types of stocks, makes them fall on top of each other to make you laugh, and then comes with a large amount of heart. <br /> <br /> Guy Thing is a movie you've seen before, and the filmmakers knew this clearly when they decided to do it. We have never seen new romantic comedies from Shakespeare; the relative success of this or that depends entirely on the execution of the classic story of the boy he meets the girl. A Guy Thing embraces him with a bit of metachinematic advantage, often taking the scenes in the absurd to give the public the chance to recognize the powerful emotions and the ancient plot devices in play. <br /> <br /> For the record, he also manages to make fun of the traditional structural notions of sex and sex that make up the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there could get kicked. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as fantastic as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to ruin everything for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothes shop attendant are among the coolest guys in the cinema, I suggest you say "It's a boy thing" and leave to this.
