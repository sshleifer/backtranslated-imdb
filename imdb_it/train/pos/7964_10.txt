I'm surprised how much I love this film despite the fact that I don't really like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the acting of the animals themselves is simply amazing. I've seen this movie 72 times (I know it sounds scary, but it's true!), And every time the final scenes still capture me. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. It's really my favorite movie of all time!
