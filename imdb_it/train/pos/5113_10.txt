This film was a classic. I must say that this film has captured the best of a man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all get along and learn how everyone did in this movie. It has played an important part in showing how the family is an important part of life, and how pride can make you lose something important in life if we can't find a "GREAT THROAT" and swallow pride.
