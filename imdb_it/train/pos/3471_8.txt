Recently shown on cable TV, the film opens with a disclaimer that stands out from any cooperation of real life people; this is in itself a glance. Yet the script and the acting of the main characters are superb and I found myself absorbed everywhere. The sparkling, thoughtful and interesting dialogue is not much. The film is about a meeting in one day between two "legends" of real life that previously composed together and then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that offers an explanation for their initial "division". What is so impressive is that the actors give such an apparently realistic portrait of the characters they interpret, flaws and everything, that at least this viewer was left to believe that I was witnessing a real event in almost every detail. The great skill of this game is that with a clever writing and a fine acting, a film that basically talks about "two of us" can make an excellent picture. Worth at least 8 out of 10.
