The League of Gentlemen is one of the most fun, weird, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. So much, it has paved the way for more comedies of this type, many of which have copied the style, but have never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike every other sketch show around, the characters of The League of Gentlemen are all connected to each other. First of all they live in the imaginary city of Royston Vasey, in the back of northern England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to greet the newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, the sloppy face owners of a seemingly local shop located so far away that most residents probably don't know of its existence. Other oddities include: the Denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss who sells a brand of special but fortunately unknown meat; Pauline, a reboot officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper feathers; Mr. Chinnery, good-hearted veterinarian and threat to all things on all fours; Geoff Tipps, a plastic seller with a vicious sense of humor, who often involves guns, and tubes. . . . . . . PLUM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy at heart, The League of Gentlemen often transcends genres without ever seeming to break or tear material from others. There are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an owner of an obsessive circus and a sudden burst of epistaxis. Even more striking are the moments in which the series takes on a more sober tone and the characters mentioned above such as Pauline and Geoff are shown in a more comprehensive and vulnerable light. Film adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide to belong to their own country. <br /> <br /> Even the equally underrated third series takes a different path, instead of sketching every episode focuses on a single character with each plot leading to a conclusion involving a plastic bag and a van of the company of theater on the run. Although many fans may not like the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they are certainly signs of how inventive the League of Gentlemen can be, and how it is not afraid to explore new areas. <br /> <br /> In short, The League of Gentlemen certainly deserves a look, as the welcome signs say: NEVER LEAVE!
