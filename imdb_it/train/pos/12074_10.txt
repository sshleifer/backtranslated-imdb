Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best film noir directors. This is definitely his best. <br /> <br /> It does not have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir. Although American-made, it is set entirely in England. The gangsters are missing. A femme fatale is missing. Crime is not missing. <br /> <br /> The title character responds to an announcement. She is delighted that she will make money as a secretary. Instead, he wakes up a few days later as a pawn in a scary plot. Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifying and disturbing ordeal. And Nina Foch gives the sense of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from casting against the guy: Mrs. Foch has an elegant way. She is not a screaming and crouched victim. She is actually a bit cold and patrician, even if impeccable. This makes his character's drama even more believable. <br /> <br /> Surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty. It was (and is) probably the most famous for the fascinating title character in "The Lady Vanishes". It has a sweet and a harmless, slightly uncertain way. But here she is far from a heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is excellent as his extremely problematic son. In fact, the entire cast is superb. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant film was made almost by accident. Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a limited budget. This is the thrill and fascination of film noir, the real film noir: it is small, convincing lowlife and, in this case, unforgettable.
