Cross-eyed is a very original and fun movie. I think Adam Jones brings a new set of eyes to the comic genre and really reinvents it in a good way. This film is intelligent, concise and constantly fun and entertaining. As a writer / director, Jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable. History is certainly something you've never seen before, which is good. It is unique and fun, and it manages to work together with visually fantastic elements and the genre of the long spell together to form a rich play. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
