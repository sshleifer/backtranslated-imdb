If I could go back, even as an adult and relive the days of my summer spent at the camp ... I would be there so fast. The fields I went to were not even large. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes actually take people away, but we had horses and fishing. The film's cinematography was staggering, the characters funny and credible especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. The character and subtleties of Sam Raimi were priceless. So who ever thought that this movie was lame ... I have a deep pity because they can't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine life in the camp again as adults or never went as children. The point was that these people had the opportunity to regress and become young again and so they did on every occasion. I wish I could. It was fun, smart, beautifully scripted, brilliantly cast and the art takes me back so I want to watch it again and again just for the scenery. Sort of like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies but the wild nature becomes a character as much as the actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and watch it again and again and again ... it never gets old. ; 0)
