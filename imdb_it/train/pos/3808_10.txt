I voted this 10 out of 10 simply because it's the best animated story I've seen in a while. The animation is amazing. The artwork behind every landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting to the non-standard price of art. I was amazed. Moving beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a plot that is both timeless and fresh at the same time. Character development is short, but these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to induce the viewer into what and why and where the character has arrived where he is. I am impressed by the whole thing and I think this is a must see for the whole family.
