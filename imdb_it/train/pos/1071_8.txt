surely he needed some work in season 2. Like the Virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White along with his ancient, super-cult. During the second season, however, the only thing that made me look was to see if Max and Logan would ever get rid of the virus that was infecting Max. The drama was very nice in the second season. But of course like all TV shows, if there is something wrong, the TV company takes it from the sky. I was seriously hoping for the third and final season. Season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read Max Allan Collins books, then you know what happens. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel should be aired again for another season although it could cost a lot just to have all the original actors again. since the sky of Jessica Alba has skyrocketed after the show. If so, then there should be a movie to complete it. just like the Firefly show, which of course FOX has also canceled.
