The film was comparable, but this television pilot offers a great springboard into what has become an ideal program for science fiction fans. The actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent and interesting script doesn't hurt either. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
