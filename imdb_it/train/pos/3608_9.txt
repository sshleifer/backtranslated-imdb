Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best ones are those that focus less on sport and more on character, like Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama and an extraordinary first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight's feelings are both realistic and engaging, that's enough to make it a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite ahead. Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her typing arguments in the corridor she is close to expulsion. As a possible means to unleash his anger, he enrolls in boxing lessons at the club where his brother is training (at the wishes of his father). <br /> <br /> Within ninety minutes, we viewers see something extraordinary. Diana changes almost literally from girl to woman. We see it in her body as well as in her behavior, especially when one of the club boys finds herself attracted to her, and she puts her inside. There is not a bad scene or a lame / forced moment in the film. The only mistake I could say could be correct is that one of the subplots ends up on what looks like an unfinished note. Apart from that, Girlfight is a great movie.
