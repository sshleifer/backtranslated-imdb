Another excellent Arnold film. This futuristic film has a great action, and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed as a bad boy in this film and plays a game of death. This film is excellent and a great science fiction / action film. I've always liked this movie and it must be one of the greatest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
