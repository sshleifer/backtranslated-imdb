"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is without doubt one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski plays Trelkovsky, a shy employee who lives in Paris, who responds to an announcement for an apartment, only to find out that the previous tenant attempted suicide by jumping out of the apartment window. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky moves immediately when the previous tenant dies and, at first, is quite happy to have found such a beautiful apartment. His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant. This movie is great. Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of terror and paranoia. More than brilliant moments like the classic scene in which Trelkovsky discovers the tooth of the previous conductor in a hole in the wall, or the fever dreams where he wanders in the building The bathroom is that of find the walls covered with hieroglyphics. Sven Nykvist's photography is really beautiful. "The tenant" is a neglected gem. It may be difficult to trace, but it is more than worth it.
