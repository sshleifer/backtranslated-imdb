My personal feeling is that you can't divorce this film from its political / historical bases like many (American) reviewers do. It's not about growing up on Main Street in the United States. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was fought between East and West. Just like the boys are torn between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is torn between the "Tovarish Joe" and the boys. There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the film is undervalued and it's a shame we lost the director. Movies like this make one feel the most important freedom. It is not just "another film of the Eastern European age" ... it is a sensitive portrait of teenagers walking on a thin line that could eventually lead them to true freedom.
