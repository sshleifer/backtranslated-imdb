I lived Rawlins when this film was made and I was lucky enough to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin for special effects. It was fun to see all the mechanisms behind the scenes, from the animated Barbedwire to the electric chair across the floor of the guard office. It was also a lot of fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate that was cut in the prison wall for the film was and is still called "Disney Gate" by the locals. If anyone is interested and is still in Rawlins, most movie sets are still in place and can be seen on the self-guided tour. It was a lot of fun to work for and with R. Harlin and I wanted to have the chance to do it again.
