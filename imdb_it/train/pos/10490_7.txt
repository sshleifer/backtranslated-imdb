Yet another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story, told and interpreted well. Brenda Blethyn gives a stratified and warm performance like Grace, recently widowed and financially close, cleverly assisted by a solid supporting cast. The "bizarre little town" card is played to the end, similar to many TV series and films that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). As before, this film takes advantage of an incredibly beautiful rural setting, in this case the damp and wild Cornish coast. <br /> <br /> Some viewers may feel that accepting cannabis is a bit challenging, others may find it ending up just a little too cute and safe. But it's a fun spit, to be sure.
