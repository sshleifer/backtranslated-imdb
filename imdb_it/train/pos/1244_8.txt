I saw this film on television for the first time some years ago and honestly I loved it. Charles Dance is one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine. His refinement is such a perfect contrast to the starkly good hero. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy but I found his portrait annoying here a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is, to use a banal phrase but the only one applicable, splendidly luminous. Some scenes are beautifully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the stupid fighting scenes and the climate clash. Through all this Murphy is the modern man who suddenly fell into an oriental myth, a dazed and more tranquil version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy. Like that movie we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however brief, raise the quality of Derek too. Since 1955 Hong has defined the supporting actor, the class act of his profession. "The Golden Child" is foolish; it's not perfect; but it has so many redemptive features that it is a fun and entertaining fantasy, worth watching. After four years I saw "The golden child" again; I liked it even more! It's really funny.
