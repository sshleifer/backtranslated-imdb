Two women, sick of their controlling husbands, who spend a month in Italy with two other very different women. They come back refreshed and full of energy in this wonderful little Merchant - Ivory film. <br /> <br /> Great scenarios and also the location is not bad. Seriously, a great time, piece 7 out of 10
