The Haunted World by Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, it is inconspicuous and economical, the people who are part of it let themselves go to the tangents that make it very blurry and inconsistent, but this adds to its charm. I say this because it is a documentary about a strange game that has made strange images and surrounded itself with other friends and, as such, there is really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits. There are some glimpses of intuition both in the genius and in Wood's ineffectiveness, and the portrait of both qualities is a merit to the genuineness of the documentary. Overall, it's worth watching Wood's fans and those in the cinema in general, but don't expect brilliance here. Expect a documentary made after Wood's heart.
