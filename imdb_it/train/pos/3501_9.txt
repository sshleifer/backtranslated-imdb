One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a story of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City, with the two protagonists as superstars. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing version of urban youth that puts Larry Clark's often sickly shtick in the gutter to which it belongs ... although I must admit that Bully was a cut above his normal rate . Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you will kick for lack ... so don't miss it!
