A beautiful film that deeply touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and since nothing in this world can be really perfect, it's pretty good. The only minor thing I subjectively object to is rhythm in some places in the middle of the story. Even the acting is very good and all the actors are the best actors in high-profile films. The current direction seems to have been well thought out and the script must have been surprising. There are some truly stunning moments of foreshadowing, and a fairly wonderful continuous circular composition of history. <br /> <br /> The moment in the film, when the main character reaches that feeling of being in paradise is the perfect ending to a really brilliant yarn.
