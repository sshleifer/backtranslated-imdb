I must say that despite the reviews Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie. I like the fact that it teaches children to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball films, this particular film stands out for its amazing special effects and well-orchestrated soundtrack that was very interesting. Although I liked this film, it had some flaws like irrelevance (eg. Towards the end when Ray Mitchell strikes a homosexual does not step on the plate and therefore would not be a score, but is just picky.) he was really impressed by the presence and the moral of this film: have faith, don't give up.
