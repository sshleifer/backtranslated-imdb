I read some of the other comments from users and decided to include one. Some users are stuck in a "realist" type of mentality. This film was meant to be a 'fantasy' ... a 'what if' movie. It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was really enjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 and I really enjoyed this - even my young son loved it! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she loved it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should only be appreciated for this - fun. All the "realists" of the world should clear themselves or just watch documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. So sorry for those young people who have watched this movie before and then been able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have expected to find the same kind of environment that was portrayed in the film and then felt "disappointment" ... I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh good. If you love fantasy-funny movies and haven't seen this, I highly recommend it! To enjoy!
