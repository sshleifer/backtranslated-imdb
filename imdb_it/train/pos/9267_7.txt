It's not a bad movie. Somehow I was forced to root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about football and I'm not a fan. The ending on the bus was exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they cannot enter sports arenas among men because their oath is inappropriate for women. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them are captured and detained. It is truly surprising that any company can still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi states that his films are documents of history and his injustices, and that one day in the future we can watch these films and see how Iran once lived. It is hoped that the future will come sooner or later.
