Cashing in on the "demon-meets-clergy" trend of the late 60s / early 70s that included the triptych of "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", "The Sentinel" is also a plus good (even if the most neglected of the lot). In a sense, he combines the best elements of those films and throws himself into Polanski's "The Tenant" (released the same year) for good measure. A New York model unable to engage with the lawyer's boyfriend moves into a moss-covered country house that initially looks like the perfect place; he meets a huge old coot of a neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), plus the other tenants off-center. Remained awake by loud noises over his apartment, he soon discovers that a silent priest and she herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building. From there, the director Michael Winner ("Death Wish") sets in motion this supernatural thriller, and there is a diabolic joy at the hallucinogenic tortures that he inflicts on his heroine. Aided by brilliant cast, subtle plot and FX makeup by Dick Smith ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a truly terrifying horror film.
