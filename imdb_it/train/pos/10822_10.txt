I was lucky enough to see this film many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since then, but I've never forgotten it. Even though Sinatra was playing a not-so-catchy character, he was excellent in the role. A lot of people seem to think that he hasn't really gotten into her until his role in "From Here To Eternity" but in my opinion it was great in Concho. The other role that remains in my mind is that of William Conrad. I would never have seen or heard of him before this film. Conrad plays a formidable part in this film. I remember his deep and grave voice and he uses it beautifully to improve the few words he speaks with a threat that defines the tone of his character. Also, I remember the music, which introduces both Conrad and it seems to surround it whenever it appears. An excellent film and my only disappointment was that I never had the chance to see it again. Seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the titles that he says the film is in black and white but when I saw that it was really in color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
