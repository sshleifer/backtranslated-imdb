I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so first I bought the tickets and then I checked the reviews on IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I enjoyed watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously had to be scary, were actually rather humorous, almost like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I don't consider this bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a rather well done horror movie. It doesn't rely much on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a great job, quite convincing. The other actors weren't bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are beautiful (and I don't care that the sets are exactly the same as those used in the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> Moments of fear were often predictable. But not always. I saw a little horror and did not expect to be afraid, but it happened at least twice. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film had some beautiful scenes that were almost original, like the garbage trail, the simple special effects for ghosts, the boy's eyes, the cat that made disturbing noises, the boy's gurgling dead and his mother. <br /> <br /> Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy, because it's very different from her work than Buffy, much more serious. Don't go if you want to see only films that collect the Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave a 7.
