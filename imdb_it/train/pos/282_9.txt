This is undeniably the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the kind of fps shoot-everything-that-moves on average (usually I don't care much), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") above all the incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye, which allows you, at certain points of the games, to see or hear events that happened in the past. The only game I had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of play only because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a big fan of horror, especially Clive Barker's stories and films, and participating in a horror story like this makes me want other games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more engaging story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of fps and maybe the game was a bit short?)
