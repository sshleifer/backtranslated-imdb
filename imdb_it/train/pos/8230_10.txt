Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story of small crimes that ordinary people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to absolute disaster. One of the most intelligent series of Greece ever! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible "guilty" laughter. Each viewer seemed to recognize the negative side of themselves in one of the characters or at least a part of themselves they wanted to have. Actors of all ages who have interpreted increasingly smaller parts have conquered an equally large space in the heart of the Greek public. My personal favorites (apart from the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but so many amazing actors from a few episodes of time to time. Anyone all over the world understands that the Greek should find a way to watch this series, even though more than 5 years have passed on TV. In Greece they continue to repeat the series (ANT1) on all occasions that there are summer or early afternoon areas. We will never forget Eglimata or any of the cast members!
