With the rapid interconnection of crazy scenes in a madhouse, and the mounting / overlaying of images and vague and intertwined narratives, this is a very difficult film to follow. Apparently a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum, so he can stay close to his imprisoned wife and maybe save her. But she is clearly mad, curled up on the floor, with a vacant expression for most of the time and fear, unhappiness and confusion written on her face for the rest of the time. The director sometimes changes his point of view, and we see vague images of her on the side of a pond that drowns a child or clings to a drowned child. She is tormented by something. When the point of view shifts to her or to other crazy people, the director uses distorting lenses and things like that, showing us what crazy people see and then how they react. And the place is swarming with crazy people, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing frantically day and night. At one point the man tries to take his wife out, but the night outside the door he terrifies her and runs back to his cell. Little by little the man slips into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in another attempt to kidnap her, and kills the doctor and many assistants, and all the while the crazy riders laugh and applaud. When it wakes up it is raised and dries the floor. Some fascinating shots of life, of streets, of Japanese buildings in the 1920s.
