Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, even if it recalls his next round in Rainman, is the kind of performance that makes me watch movies. As a portrait of a New York character, only the portrait of Bill Butcher by Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify more with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of the film to play the people around him in such a way as to elevate their performance far above their normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so naive as to completely get out of the movie, except that Ratso pulls him down - he pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a film about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think, as gritty as a film is, it has a very nice message, that no matter how much you may be a loser (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life and you may even be able to share this insight with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy with Klute, a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a film about escape.
