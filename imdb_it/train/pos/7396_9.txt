Another prominent foreign film that thoroughly defeats the unbroken crop of crud that emanates from Hollywood! This is a story of life and life. No, certainly not the perfect little life so often depicted in totally artificial Hollywood movies, but rather, the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses, just like real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and in particular its old owner, are magnificent, touching and stimulating. <br /> <br /> Sit down, relax and let yourself be transported into the simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to learn in this film if you only open up to this. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
