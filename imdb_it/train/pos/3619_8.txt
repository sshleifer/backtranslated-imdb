Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a pretty funny movie about how to follow your dreams. I was surprised that he didn't seem too sentimental; this movie was honest Dennis Quaid was very, very good at the role, saying something about a sports movie. I can't remember how many sports movies have had small quirks that annoy me; here, everyone looks the part. This film is surprisingly good, and I expect it will do amazing business as it is a G-rated movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert, on the contrary, this film is a success.
