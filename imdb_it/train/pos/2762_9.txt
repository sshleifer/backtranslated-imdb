This film is my favorite celluloid piece. There isn't really much I need or want to say here. Except maybe "Watch this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal", which takes you through this clean, fun and heartbreaking story about "spending your eighth day" - your day! <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Or if it's enjoyable for a career or simply consuming TV shows and ball games. What we tend to lose is the satisfaction of being something for another person: making a difference. About taking up space and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least that's what I received from "The Eighth Day".
