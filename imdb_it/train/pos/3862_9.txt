Since I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be just another movie with "B", but I was amazed by the acting of the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. The plot was wonderful and unique, with excellent moral for the story. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely not for those in search of sexual amusement, "Dumb and dumber" or blood and courage. This is a wonderfully moving film that shows some dark realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and enough frivolity to keep it interesting. I would prefer this film to many "A" films, I have also seen a large number with high box office earnings. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
