Just read the original story which is written by Pu in the 18th century. Surprisingly, the film despises the original spirit very well, although the plot has been changed tremendously. The language of the film, the rhythm, the special effect are all from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together. The result is pure beauty.
