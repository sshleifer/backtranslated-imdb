"The Days" is a typical family drama with a little catch: you have to relate to the emotions of the character in every possible way to make you really appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who are Unknown with the show] <br /> <br /> The story, of course, for all the people who have seen the show, is the world of Cooper Day, the middle child of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his remarks. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a genius-brother. The first episode, which will seem a little stupid since John Scott Shepard created this situation, both her sister and mother become pregnant. This is the first situation that affects the writer. Then the father leaves the job at the law firm. The younger son gets a panic attack. The middle child collides with his sister's boyfriend. This is all in a day of work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoiler] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit crappy but I like it. First, I thought that working with the camera was a scam, but then I used it and liked it. I liked silent conversations in a dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked acting. I admire history. Then I find myself wanting a second season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of this episode when the broadcast of 6 episodes on ABC ended. It's a really good show and it's nothing like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can connect with Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even with Nate, you'll like this show. A lot.
