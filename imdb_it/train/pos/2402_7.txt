The main reason for seeing this film is Warren William, who is in excellent shape as manager of the shyster campaign. It's electric, constantly finding ways to deceive the public and defeat the opposing party amid the greatest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he never got his due. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under-written role. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee not quite as correct as the lame-brain candidate William and the others are trying to impose on the public. It looked more like an empty canvas than a person. I would rather have seen a real character emerge than a non-character. The story itself is far-fetched, silly and clich√©. But it's worth watching Warren William and Bette Davis.
