Great film that tells the story of an old man looking back in time. Starting in 1910, he remembers his boyfriend and his young adulthood; his family, friends, novels, etc. A very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet ending ... "all things in life come together as one, and a river flows through it and that river haunts me". Worth seeing.
