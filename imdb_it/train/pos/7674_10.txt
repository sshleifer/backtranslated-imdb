I had the privilege of watching "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12 year old Vietnamese girl who is sold to prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) enters Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her. We follow their difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The film portrays this difficult problem without crossing the line. I went away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can I help? This film should be seen by everyone, because it is a good story and exposes a problem that we should no longer ignore.
