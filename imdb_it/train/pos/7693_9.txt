"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, is a CBS hit a must see! Although I have never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I love the theme song. If you ask me, even if I like them all, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show for the duration. Everyone always gave a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can now be seen on TV Land, I highly recommend you to take it if it goes on air forever.
