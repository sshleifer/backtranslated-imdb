I can't believe we don't have the spectacle of the 70s anymore. I have all 8 seasons of the 70s show !! I absolutely love it !! I lie down in bed every night and watch several episodes before going to sleep. At the end of a busy day, it's nice to relax and have a good laugh before going to sleep. I was so sad that they took the show on the air ... at least we still have the replicas !! I'm hoping and praying that they'll come back with at least one meeting ... How maybe when Donna finishes university and we can finally see her and Eric get married !!!! It wouldn't be great !!! It would be even better if they continued for several years !!
