It is not the worst film ever made, the actors are not apathetic and the script and the director are not completely inept. <br /> <br /> It is not the best film of all time, the actors are not excellent and the script and the director are not completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. A fun somewhere. A pleasant place, well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> No need to say "don't take it seriously" or "so bad it's good" or "it wasn't scary". None of these comments is relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut has an atmosphere. It is that atmosphere that is truly unique, and the truly original aspect of the film, which is personally what makes the film, for me.
