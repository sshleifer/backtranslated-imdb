Congratulations to the authors of this film for creating an extremely engaging drama. The curious development of the character is indicative of a nuanced and well-educated writing team. The audience member cannot help but feel that (s) he must make strident emotional decisions that put the brain against libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to personally develop the character, although his predictions are rarely validated. <br /> <br /> Credit merit is also due to filmmakers for having breathed life into the environment. The wood workshop turns into a unique character in its unfolding of the film, with its traits, its flaws, a variety of highly charged relationships and, of course, a destiny inexorably linked to that of other principles. <br /> <br /> Make sure you take this to your local art-house.
