Not only does this film have one of the most beautiful titles in the film, but it is also the third team of secondary actors of the 70s, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember that this film was broadcast during the '78 Halloween week going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our house. I missed the first release by choosing to watch the other movie. Later, repeatedly, I saw that I made the right choice. The film is not so bad, but it really lacks chills or surprises. Although, I liked the scene in which Richard Crenna shoots the family dog ​​without success.
