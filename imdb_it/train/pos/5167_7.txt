I must say that the worst part of the film was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, the character of Bill Paxson had long hair and wore a jacket. Then, when all the males arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but he wasn't. Did I say where Bill Paxson is? Then, there was a boy with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. It was supposed to be the most memorable 20-year meeting of the camp director (Alan Arkin). Later, this same girl interacted and talked about her field experiences. It didn't make sense. He would have been one year old. That said, the film turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the good guy who was always teased. A boy was a complete narcissist and eventually lost his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as a director of an old-style camp, which admits he has become out of touch with modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult campers was a success in life. None of them has had great careers. It seemed like a very real life. The film has been compared to The Big Chill. In a sense it wasn't as exciting as the Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So even if the beginning is not promising, the film ended up turning into a pretty good one.
