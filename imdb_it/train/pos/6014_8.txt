All the reviews on how much ZP lacks plot, the acting is in wood, the scene of the orgies doesn't make sense, etc., All the main point is missing. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This is a film made in the exciting years of the late 60s and early 70s in Los Angeles. It's a film designed to be watched while you're H-I-G-H out of your mind on a psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find some gentle gems and smoke, or get a slight acid hit. Seriously, these straight and sober revisions of ZP lack the point. You can't get anything from this movie in a linear mood. <br /> <br /> Until you watched this movie on the big screen (which I was lucky to do three times in the 90s when ZP was pretty rare), you have no idea what this movie is. <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching it not poisoned, you can at least appreciate the end when crap jumps to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful reworking of "Careful With That Ax, Eugene", "How in Number 51, Your Time Is Up. "
