Twisty, bizarre, charming and fun! I couldn't stop laughing watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on the family video camera that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a budding director and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, yet we don't watch all the movies to be manipulated in one way or another? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was amused by the fact that the guys in the movies seemed to appear bare-chested whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on his nascent homosexuality, and can be seen from the suggestions (great clues!) Of pomp at an early age. Maybe it was just the warm climate of Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who grew up in an educational environment, it's nice to see that his parents supported him and loved him, and that his friends seemed entranced by his nascent talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Put the camera on me" offers a look back to the 80s untouched by commercialism. You will remember your hair, music and fashions. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so the journey back to memory was welcome. His dance number for lip-synching is priceless, enhanced by the Frankie Goes To Hollywood t-shirt. <br /> <br /> The films deal with dark themes at a time. Child abuse, holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely carefree, and the way Stein handles these topics is interesting and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> See you soon!
