The Finnish version of "Short Cuts" by Robert Altman, set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, despair and death. I was particularly struck by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a love story for her collaborators: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode shows up and the old man dies in a hospital and his wife tries to help him die with dignity. Particularly surprising is the way in which the old couple must make their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasts with the "habits" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of an occasional occasion). Compared to the classic Altman, this film is perhaps less professional, but it is certainly a great piece of art.
