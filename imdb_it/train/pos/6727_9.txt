I realized a couple of days ago that the creators of this film have put a play on words in its title. This film is not primarily about "riding giants", but especially the people who are the giants of the sport, giant RIDING, to change the emphasis. <br /> <br /> In my adolescence I lived in a block from the Wedge, one of the most difficult and most difficult bodysurfing places in the world. I have been surfing from 15 to 18 feet and have ridden and hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I'm completely terrified of surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, for all appearances of a normal mortal, can get by while riding Maverick by BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my reach. The first safety rule of any water sport is "Don't surf / dive / swim alone". He went where the sensible people did not want, and lived to tell it. I wouldn't go out there if the water was at 75 degrees and all the sharks left. <br /> <br /> In the world of hot water: the first blow of the waves in Jaws always makes the skin tingle all over my body. These are not just scary waves, they are waves of uncontrolled intestinal evacuation. When we see Laird Hamilton not only survive waves from 40 to 60 feet (I can't type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm amazed. There is a dedication and concentration in the big wave riders that is comparable to that of anyone else in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave him a 9 instead of a 10 just because he fails to mention that there are some fantastic knights in the world outside of the Hamilton / Kalama team, and I think they deserved mention. Join Ken Bradshaw outside of Log Cabins and a 10 is!
