it is a very beautiful film and I would recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 negative points: - the story level has a broad spectrum. some scenes are very beautiful and some are simply boring. - many stories are not autonomous (if you compare to coffee and cigarettes, where every story has a point, a message, a joke or whatever you want to call it) but, well, most of the stories are really good, some are great and overall it's definitely one of the best films this year! <br /> <br /> annoying, that I have to fill at least 10 lines, I have no more to say and I don't want to start by analyzing the individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> well, I think so!
