Hitchcock was of the opinion that the public was not really interested in what endangers the protagonists - only that they are in danger and must flee. <br /> <br /> This film shows that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. The police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime when clearly he is not. Trevor Howard decides that their best course of action is to run for it. And so, the body of the film has our charismatic couple dodging in and out of trains, buses and buses - jumping over rocks on top of a waterfall - climbing over the roofs of the tanks. <br /> <br /> All good and interesting things - but I couldn't get it out of my mind that it was useless. They should have remained. <br /> <br /> In other words, the MacGuffin was not strong enough.
