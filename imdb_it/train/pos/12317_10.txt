A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is something negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story, it could be that the special effects seemed dated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector must stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. Of course, he also seems to be obsessed. <br /> <br /> What I didn't expect the first time I saw this movie is that it's one of the most moving love stories I've ever seen; that is without losing any slapstick comedy that will make you points. Unlike some films of Asian cinema, A Chinese Ghost Story is not difficult to digest for those who are not experts in Chinese culture. In fact, he plays on timeless themes without paranormal culture and romanticism. <br /> <br /> Think Evil Dead 2, if they had thrown in the mix a wonderful love story. This film is real, despite being overlooked by many. It is absolutely among the best I've ever seen. His ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and to overcome cultural boundaries to attract humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
