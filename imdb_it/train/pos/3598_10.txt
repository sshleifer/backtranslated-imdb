Being a person who usually doesn't love boxing movies, feeling focused only on boxing and not on the characters themselves, this movie really moved me. I liked being able to see the protagonist Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) going through so many things in such a short time, it was incredible for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did a great job interpreting Diana mainly because this was her first acting experience, showed real emotions and played Diana wonderfully. All the actors had chemistry on the screen and made this film even more surprising. I highly recommend this film even to those who don't usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
