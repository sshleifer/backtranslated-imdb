When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15) I was really impressed! It has a completely different style than the animation of Japan and I like it a little more. The whole impression of the film is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not so ... usus. The characters don't talk much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark images, the visions of strange beasts and the sense of magic, it seems one of those ancient Scandinavian stories full of violence and hideous creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, trolls, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop the evil ...
