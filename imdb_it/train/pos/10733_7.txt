Watching this movie again reminded me of great childhood memories. I'm 34, I haven't seen him since I was 12-14 years old. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I looked at it again recently, some scenes literally tore a tear from me! That little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like revisiting my childhood. It was an absolutely incredible experience for me. For this reason I will always love this movie. I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular film, but for any film you haven't seen in a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Thanks for reading
