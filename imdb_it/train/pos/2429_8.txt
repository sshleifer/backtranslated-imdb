If you love Deep Cover, you might also like this movie. Many of the poetic interludes that Fishburne plays in Deep Cover are taken from the lyric script of "Once In The Life", a film adaptation of a play written by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I do, you will love this movie which is all Larry, all very exciting, and all done. Obviously there is the game of the gun and the use of illicit substances, after all this is a gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story is moving, even a little on the side of the chick. <br /> <br /> INCREDIBLE movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you sneak around at night or hang in a club house, you'll get the right impact from the cramped ensembles (which reflect metaphor for being trapped in life). Filled with skilled foreshadows and complex relationships, this film is tense ... every feeling is reflected in the setting and in the shots. GOOD JOB!
