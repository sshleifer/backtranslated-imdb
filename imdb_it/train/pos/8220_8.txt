The fourth in the series "Dirty Harry", this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikely, profane and disgusting women I've ever seen in the movie: "Ray Perkins", played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern low-life version of the "Detour" character from 1945, "Ann Savage". His dirty mouth and his charlatan attitude made me so blown away that I never watched this movie again until I acquired an obscene filter that silences it ... and at least some of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Wherever "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows ... in minutes! It happens so often that it's almost ridiculous, but it makes a movie fun and fast with a satisfying ending when all the bad scumbag are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophisticated film that appeals to our basic instincts ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirty balls coming to an end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
