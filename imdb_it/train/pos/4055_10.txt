This film is fantastic and I would recommend it to children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; much better than anything American studies were producing at the time. However, there are a couple of warnings to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli's back catalog and then proceeded to butcher it. My main point is that Disney has renamed the film, although the original English version is very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek has ruined everything and has taken away much of the character's appeal, eg. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to plaintive kids. The original soundtrack is also much better than the Disney remix. The question arises why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me that having Van Der Beek and others in the cast, Disney can draw more money, which is quite fair, but in the process they have contaminated the film. It's still a beautiful film and I would recommend it to anyone anyway. My main craze is that Disney has ruined a childhood film that I loved and still love. I am fortunate to have a Japanese original imported with the original English dubbing that I am now going to protect with my life!
