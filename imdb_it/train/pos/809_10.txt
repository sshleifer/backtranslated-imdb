A great movie. A classic science fiction film with humor, action and everything. This film offers more aliens. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and most of the imperial forces. The emperor is somehow an original character. I liked the Ewoks who somehow represented the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best in the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire definitely falls. I also enjoyed the celebration of victory where Vader redemption is realized and hi back in the spirit of Anakin Skywalker along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The biggest scenes in Star Wars are in this movie: when Vader turns on the emperor. Luke observes and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to hit Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a dark side to this film, although there is a good ending. I felt that there was much more than it seems. And as always, John William's music will bring classicism into the Star Wars universe.
