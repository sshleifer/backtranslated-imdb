Based on the fact that it is based on the notorious mass suicide incident of modern times, it would have been enough to give this two-part 1980 movie a TV movie. But the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of Rev. Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire, and then encouraged her to disintegrate into a bleak cult in which a member of Congress and his entourage were murdered, and 917 followers of the cult committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid sprinkled with cyanide. <br /> <br /> Made with much taste but quite atrocious, unlike the terribly sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNES, GUYANA TRAGEDY presents a cast of famous actors, including Ned Beatty (as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in his first big role) that stands out as Jim Jones. He actually becomes man, and his performance is compelling and chilling. Therefore, it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
