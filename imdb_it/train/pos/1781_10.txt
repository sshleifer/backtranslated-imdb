... here comes the Romeo division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that I was defeated by this short film. I saw him, at random, when I was in Boston at a film festival and since then I have thanked God for this. I really think I was part of a happening, like reading a Tarantino script before anything else or seeing the first screening of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival the short is directed at or what the creative team has at their disposal for future products, but I hope I can be there for that. <br /> <br /> Once again, a truly incredible film.
