Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book movie made to date. The film has the same atmosphere as the comic, remaining true to the color scheme. The Batman series is climbing, falling, climbing and falling again. Dick Tracy has a real capacity for endurance as something that both adults and children can enjoy. Good guys triumph over evil, without blood and blood to get the result. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best job by far is Warren Beatty who perfectly embodies Dick Tracy just like he did with Clyde Barrows. I can't wait for the DVD to go out on April 2, 2002, my tape is running out.
