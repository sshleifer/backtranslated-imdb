I didn't expect much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised, because it's light, fun and very well observed. The central trio of deadbeat motorcyclists was surprisingly likeable as they stumbled and made their way on their drug-centered journey to Wales. The humor was delicate and subtle, as were the three characters (they testify to their sympathy for the little shopkeeper). The environments of rural Wales were captured perfectly and the soundtrack was chosen very well. With cunning and scrupulous screenplay, with great attention to detail - I've never seen such a realistic portrait of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Very light to the touch and full of fun - not what you'd expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A joy on all fronts, and hard to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a bit boring - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But overall, an unexpected treasure of a film.
