At first glance, a film about women who want to watch a football match would not please anyone with little interest in football like me, but it is not about football, but about discrimination and women's enthusiasm for the sport they love. <br /> <br /> The film opens on the day of the crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl is trying to get into Tehran's Azadi Stadium by dressing as a boy, it seems she will get until a soldier tries to find her. Once captured, she is taken to a small fence high up, outside the stadium, where there are a handful of women who have already been captured, here they are guarded by a small group of conscripts that the boss would prefer to go home with his cattle. We never learn the names of the characters, but we come to know them as people while the girls implore the guards to let them look through a nearby crack in the wall and when they are refused they try to make them at least provide a comment. <br /> <br /> In addition to making an important point about the strict gender segregation of most of our days in Iran, the film contains many hilarious moments like the "disguise" that one of the girls wears to go to the bathroom and to girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was captured only because she chose to watch the game from a place reserved for a senior officer. The enthusiasm of the girls for the game is such that in the end the spectator is likely to be on the edge of his seat hoping that Iran will win and that he will then go to the finals in Germany. The soldiers are not shown as fundamentalists, they are only conscripts who are there because they have to be and when they explain to the girls why the woman cannot watch the sports of men do not seem convinced by their arguments. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film cannot be seen in Iran, but it is good that the world can see it and see that ordinary Iranians are not a group of fanatics who are desperately trying to make war on west but normal people with the same passions and concerns of people everywhere. The cast did a great job of making their characters look like real people rather than just caricatures.
