Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this film has humor at different levels. I just introduced it to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the movie - bursting out laughing a lot of times ... and my daughter is not a big science fiction fan. The movie made me laugh even though I saw a couple of times ... adult-level humor (ie, the humor that adults will get simply because of bigger life experiences, no quality stuff or stuff to find it here) keeps the film equally enjoyable for adults. For example, adult humor, Martian voices are based on characters from different films / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerism of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, that of Dr. Stranamore by Peter Seller. The special effects are surprisingly good for this film. The lack of the 10 best actors actually works in favor of the film, and the actors / actresses play their part well - indeed I would say that the producers have chosen actors and their abilities for the needs of the roles with respect to the attraction of the box office (an excellent example is the "Vern" character of Wayne Alexander). I had to write this review ... the kids are playing this for the third time in 4 days during dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late-night weekend, there is no bored and not bad movie.
