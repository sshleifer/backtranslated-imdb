... may seem like an exaggeration, but it is not. <br /> <br /> What is so difficult to understand is - why haven't they made more musical short films like this? Wasn't its beauty completely obvious to everyone involved? I do not believe. So many short films have been created only for commercial reasons and with a little luck there could be some artistic value. Is this an exception, the only one? - where it seems that the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate music as art. Why has no one ever thought of shooting Lester or Charlie Parker in a live? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> Too bad there were no sequels. If you have seen something of this quality please share it!
