There are very few movies so fun like this. I was lucky enough to see this film in a theater "reserved" for movie fans like me, so it wasn't so embarrassing to sit there laughing until my jaw was sore and my shirt sleeves were wet to dry my eyes. .. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but maybe it's the best - a little rest between the rolling between the corridors (I almost fell off the seat ...) is was welcome
