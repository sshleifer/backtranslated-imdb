Rohmer moves away from his usual portraits of the French bourgeoisie to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocratic woman during the French revolution. The most appealing thing about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetic that Rohmer has achieved. Even the images have been digitally decorated to make them look like baroque images. In some moments you can't really tell if you're watching a movie or a series of photos at the Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> - ------------ - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - -------- ----------
