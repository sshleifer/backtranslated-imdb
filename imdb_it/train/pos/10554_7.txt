NOTHING (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange premise of the director of the movie "Cube". This time there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void. There is literally NOTHING outside their small two-story house. Intrigued, but I thought that the comic tone established for this film from the beginning was extremely ill-conceived. There must be some humor, of course ... and I have no problem with the humor that ultimately resulted from the situation of our two heroes (their "showdown" finale was definitely a hoot) ... but I really think the film would have been much better if it had remained more rooted in reality at the beginning. After watching the film I saw the movie "Making of" on the DVD and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the more "funny" aspects of the comic ... making it a completely different (and slightly better) film. The last half hour of the film is where things really start coming together ... similar to the recent movie "Primer". The actors are fine when they're not overdoing the shtick comedy. They are really believable in their most "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this film as a failed experiment halfway ... but it finally won me over. (And he continues to look beyond the credits for the final scene ... just don't ask me to explain it.)
