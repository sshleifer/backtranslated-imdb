He's very smart throughout the 1960s of the film. The humor is rather kind, but it has grown on me much more than I expected. The cast is top notch and it looks like he's enjoying himself. Ustinov wanders around the film murmuring some pretty funny things in a whisper, and it's all very irrelevant; I will buy the movie as soon as it is released on DVD. The plot is that Ustinov, as an embezzler, got out of jail pretending to be a computer wizard and stole money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is her secretary for a while, and watching her shoot from different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual impassive self, and Karl Malden is having fun as the dense and squalid manager who runs the London office. The ending is fun and pleasantly cynical.
