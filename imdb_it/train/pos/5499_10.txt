I had no idea of ​​the facts that this film presents. While I remember this situation, I accepted the information presented then in the media: a confusing event around a doubtful personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if anything of this caliber has ever been realized. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr.Chavez but all those approaching were <br/> <br /> important and in the end the reality of that entelechy: people were overwhelming. Thanks Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
