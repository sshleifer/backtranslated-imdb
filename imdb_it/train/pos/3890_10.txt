This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in years. His routine is exhilarating and creates a good conversation with others who have seen it. I highly recommend this. The part about European history is a bit slow, but the final lines in French are pretty good, because you don't have to speak French to get it (even if you do it, it's still hilarious). Also, the parts about being a transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (on San Francisco) is not exceptional, but fun the first time. Skip those if you can. It is hardly worth looking at. However, this is really a fun and entertaining show that everyone should see. "I was dead at that moment!"
