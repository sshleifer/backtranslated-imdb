We must not lose this film, this is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is incredible (more than usual) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of the Nouvelle Vogue. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, we only have these images in black and white to remember one of the greatest and most undervalued French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I'll never forget it. <br /> <br /> P.S.: sorry for English ...
