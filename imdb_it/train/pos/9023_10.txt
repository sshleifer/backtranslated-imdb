A very gritty and courageous representation of part of the history of the Second World War, which most of us in the United States had never had an idea. I'd like to have this on video. It was shown only on t.v. once, as far as I know, in 89 or 90. I asked around for this movie, and most video stores don't even know it. Great actresses all around, I wish I could see him again. First class series.
