OH WOW. I saw this movie at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available for questions later. WHAT A SPLENDID FILM! Although set in Ireland between Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people can be dragged when they have the chance to vent their hatred and their anger has been wonderfully woven with a moving love story full of humor and fun. If this is not withdrawn in the United States, it would be really unlucky. <br /> <br /> Regarding the stars and support players ... FIRST TAXATION. I called Orla Brady the Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. It is my opinion that it is BETTER than Meryl Streep. The American Orla Brady should call Meryl! And the constant and powerful portrait of Liam Cunningham of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was fantastic. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS FILM.
