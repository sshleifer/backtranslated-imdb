Noni Hazlehurst's tour-de-force performance (which earned her an AFI award) is at least on par with her effort at FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good and, for those interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's daughter, and Michael Caton (better known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Equally interesting, Hazlehurst is currently the guest of the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS lifestyle program, and Caton is the host of property-type programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc ...). This film reaffirms the popular belief that Noni was probably the main Australian female actor during the first half of the 1980s. Score: 79/100.
