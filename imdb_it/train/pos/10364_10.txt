Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a little girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon Azaria dedicates herself to God in their church, with their two older boys watching. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in Australia. Not being rich, the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts little Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, he hears Azaria crying. While Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just coming out, shaking his head. The child is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Even if the entire field looks for the child, it has not been found. Concluding that she died and that the dingo fled with their beloved child, the Chamberlain have difficulty accepting God's decision and moving forward with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story has sensational coverage in the media and the story that Lindy killed the baby is soon circulated. It is subsequently arrested and processed. How could this happen? This is a great representation of real events that shows how the "mob rule" is not an invention of imagination. The whole country turns against the Chamberlain, partly because they are seen as strange. Streep offers her best ever performance as the complex Lindy, whose own volitional demeanor works against her every step of the way. Neill, similarly, does a great job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the greatest ever, with depictions of people all over the country doing their research in the case of Lindy. The costumes, the landscapes, the script, the direction and the production are all at the top. If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy it immediately. It is not very far from reality to say that this "Scream" should be seen by all those who love cinema and the abused power of the media.
