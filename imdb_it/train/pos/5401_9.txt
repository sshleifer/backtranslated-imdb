It is a testament to Gosha's incredible directorial ability to be able to complete both the Hitokiri and his extraordinary masterpiece, Goyokin, in the same year, 1969. And it is a testament to how criminally undervalued he remains for the general public ( compared to the expensive media like the great Akira Kurosawa), that both Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes between the two. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: crazy killer, loyal to the Tosha clan and their boss Takechi, played by another genre-in-law, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the agitated shogunate. The historical context is fairly accurate - with Japan's growing political turmoil between imperialists and Tokugawa and the pressure from the West to end a 300-year social and political isolation. It helps a lot to learn about one or two things about the history of Japan and what eventually led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate, but it is not essential in any way. The film was made mainly for a Japanese audience, so certain things are taken for granted but it runs very well even for those who don't know. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Hideo Gosha film in its golden years (the late 1960s) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hides behind beauty pictorial. However, style is never decorative for Gosha - it is always used in the service of history. <br /> <br /> And speaking of history, Hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the main tortured character Izo Okada. Like most of the protagonists of Chambara, Izo finds himself in a double moral bond, divided between laps (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although for him it takes a while to understand exactly what his lap is. In the first half of the movie, Izo is looking for social self-promotion. Sumptuous aspirations of social rank and marriage with the daughter of an aristocrat - a great progression for someone who comes from the context of a peasant in the rigid system of social castes of nineteenth-century Japan. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Izo is when it realizes the cost of self-progress, the loss of identity and consequently the loss of self. It is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the Tosha clan to a "nameless" tramp without a past or future, Torazo the Wanderer. Although he is not technically unnamed and is not a genre drifter in the Yojimbo mold, it is the loss of his former self and the rejection of ego, ambition and self-dillusion that allows Izo to see things as I'm really and redeem. <br /> <br /> Ends Hitokiri (which I will not reveal here) in the best way a story can end: both positive and negative with a profoundly ironic twist that gives Izo the last laugh, a last sardonic remark in the face of death.
