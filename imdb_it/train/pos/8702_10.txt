A woman gave birth to a boy in this world and was alone. Both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package: he was able to withdraw the sword from his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the most deadly weapon in his body. First he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. As simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, that it is really right, because it is not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha (the main hero played by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person he believes deserves to die but gets the charges from the authorities and runs. In such an escape from the authorities and the mafia he meets a girl (played by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else must be looked at ... not said. Be aware that this film speaks more about feelings and emotions but not about actions. This film is full of pain for the main character full of him and his vision of life.
