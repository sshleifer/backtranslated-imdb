Ooverall, the film was quite good, a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing except disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11th, with a terrorist full of bins sending a video to the president (Urich) and threatening to detonate it. Judson Mills had some superb action roles, eliminating Rashid's mix and various roles in football, but there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Judson took control of most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But, overall, it was realistic and there was no lack of action, but he did it only on Mr. Norris's part. I gave the movie 7/10.
