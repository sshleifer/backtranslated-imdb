This documentary makes you travel around the world. Contains rare and wonderful sequels from the wild nature. It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it. After all, its sad future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. However, this documentary is a simplistic approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, it can easily be seen by young children as it remains primarily descriptive. Scientists might be disappointed because it's not a remake of the Al Gore documentary "An inconvenient truth" but frankly ... what a description !!! A question might therefore arise: is it not worth preserving the beauty of our world? Because this documentary shows that in 2007 there is still such beauty despite the different pollution. Living in the city, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of this nature. All in all this documentary reminds us that we have a common treasure called "EARTH".
