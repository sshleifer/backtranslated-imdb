"Kolchak: the Night Stalker" is an extremely entertaining television series in which an intrusive, sarcastic and forty-year-old journalist is repeatedly involved in mortal combat with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of TV movies with the character of Kolchak, this series died quickly in the mid-70s due to low ratings, but despite this it still maintains a strong cult after today. But will the average modern spectator be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? <br /> <br /> It is actually a difficult question to answer fairly. The detractors of this series tend to argue that it is formidable and irremediably dated. On the other hand, fans claim that it is written in an intelligent, well-acted and sometimes truly spooky way. And I? I have one foot in both fields. I really enjoyed seeing all 20 Kolchak episodes on DVD recently, although I can clearly see that the series has major flaws. <br /> <br /> I will deal first of all with the Kolchak question as a "formula" fiction. Now, I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas: almost every episode of Columbo takes place according to the same pattern, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy themselves and actively seek repetitive entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak is that its formula is simply TOO hard - it's too repetitive even for the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder and discovers that he was committed by some form of monster. He tries to publish a story about this monster, but his publisher Vincenzo blocks it, again due to the fact that Kolchak does not have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. And alas, Kolchak is also obstructed by the police. So, in the end, Kolchak does some independent research on the monster, understands how to kill it ... and then kills it. Without ceremonies, prizes, or writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this rigorous formula could get boring, right? I'm particularly confused by Vincenzo - if Kolchak is always delirious about monsters, and Vincenzo never believes it ... well, then, why does Vincenzo not dismiss Kolchak, or does he commit it? This is what any normal boss would do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable - even though they are also quite funny. <br /> <br /> Kolchak's best episodes overcome the limits of this formula, however, usually because they contain some sort of unexpected blow. These selected episodes are good enough that I think they are largely immune to the typical criticism of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights - an episode that is noteworthy for being filthy, inventive and socially conscious. Kolchak's window has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Although it adheres strictly to Kolchak's formula, the script (written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster) is extraordinarily educated, and deeply delves into the monster's story. <br /> <br /> The devil's platform - a possible inspiration for Film "Omen", this episode struck me because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - tempts Kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies (and, in this way, it reveals a lot about the character of the journalist.) <br /> <br /> Firefall: this episode seems to have a bad reputation among the fans, but I liked it because it has a big false track and a monster really disturbing, almost unstoppable. <br /> <br /> Although I have identified these three episodes of praise, I would say that most of the stories are at least funny. For my money, there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode series: Primal Scream, which talks about monkey-like men that spread in Chicago, and the Sentry, which features the most stupid makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this evaluation comes from a Doctor Who and Godzilla's lifelong fan!) <br /> <br /> On balance, then, this is a good series. A little repetitive, maybe a little cheese, but it has elements of greatness. Even during the weakest episodes, the splendid performance of Darren McGavin as the caustic, tired of the world and infinitely funny kolchak really shines. Bring the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never managed on "Buffy". McGavin was a great actor, and this series deserves to be watched alone.
