Although it is recognized as the best cinematic treatment of the difficulties of having a home in the country built (or bought) according to your specifications, it is not the first nor the last. In 1940 Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the protagonists in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the command in THE MONEY PIT. The first was to move to an eighteenth century country house that ... err, needs work. The latter was about building your dream home - in the late 1980s. Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters, Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he is making $ 15,000.00 a year, which is like making $ 90,000.00 today), and he lives in a luxury apartment - which in the New York city of that day rent! - feels that they should look for something better. He and Muriel walk around the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be arranged like that dream home they want. <br /> <br /> And both fall into the financial wormhole that buying land and buildings can lead to. For one thing, they are so excited about the idea of ​​building a house like this that they can't pay attention after their wise warning, if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a very sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut merchant (Ian Wolfe, quietly sucking his chops), with a check before rechecking the correct cost of the land in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth. There are water supply problems that only Blandings never thinks of, like hard and soft water - which leads to Zis-Zis water softening. They find that the projects they have in mind, and have worked with their architect (Reginald Denny), cannot be allowed to fall on a cheap impulse from the moment Muriel decides to build a small colony that no one planned. <br /> <br /> The rising costs of the project are an issue that torments Jim. He was nominated to manage the "Wham" account ("Spam" had become a popular result of World War II, as the public started using it as a meat substitute, in light of his success with the military). Jim can't control it (he's not alone - one or two other executives ransacked him before him). Comes with the following bit of "poetry" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little pig went to the market, <br /> <br /> It was pink and cute like ham. <Br / > <br /> He smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> How they gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew it would end as "Wham"! "<br /> < br /> His secretary looks at him as if he needs a straight jacket when he reads that! <br /> <br /> Even Jim is more and more suspicious of Bill's attentions to Muriel, even though (in this case) Bill is beyond reproach. But he is always around (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is cleanheaded, and that he's preventing Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have setbacks, the best of all when they are locked up in a half-built room, just as the men left for the day. They can't open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to smash the door from a ramshackle ram. It breaks a window and the door opens by itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, with all the actors apparently having fun. It is a film that (despite changing price levels and wage levels) does not age at all. After all, most Americans dream of owning their own home and always having. <br /> <br /> A number of years ago a company of painters used a delightful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the painting work that Parnell's company has done in the various rooms. Carefully show the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. What do you want - even giving an educated Parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue. Advertisements suggested that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for its paint job. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the introduction of the commercials. You can imagine how nonsense Parnell deals with the situation later, when Loy leaves him with his painting team.
