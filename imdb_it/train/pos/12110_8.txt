For those of you who think that souls are just giant reptiles that rape female students, think again. There is a totally different side to Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a story of a young boy with the gift of making delicious bread. His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match the famous European bread. The show is as extravagant as they came and I'm sure non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of jokes. But it's still very nice to look at because of the complete innocence of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to have orgasm after eating bread. Bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a vast range of superpowers, from time travel to swimming like a fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and entertaining shows I've seen in a while.
