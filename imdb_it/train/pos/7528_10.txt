If this film hits you (as we did, and apparently the others leaving for the theater) as disappointingly thin, it could be because the subject itself is slightly disappointing. The film shows us faithfully Bettie Page as she probably was: a playful, almost innocent, rural south whose career as "the pinup queen of the universe" was a bit silly and natural fun for her. His possible moral scruples, religious conversion and the sudden abandonment of nude and slavery modeling are biographically accurate, but difficult to understand given his indifference to his livelihood. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to see this film as well, including the extraordinary noir cinematography of W. Mott Hopfel III (complete with wipes and old-fashioned fades), the faithful recitation of the 1950s under the cast the direction of Mary Harron, perfect interpretations by some of our undervalued actors (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak), not to mention the Oscar-winning performance and technically difficult of Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mol does several completely naked scenes and most of the others in splendid period costumes and "special" costumes (beautifully assembled by costume designer John A. Dunn), but surprisingly surprising Bettie Page's untried pleasure in her lush body. Watching Ms. Mol as Ms. Page, an aspiring actress, progressing through grades of progressively less "bad" auditions and student acting scenes means seeing a truly beautiful actress in full control of her art. <br /> <br /> The script actually takes us to 1950s America, where child sexual abuse, illegitimate seizure and rape and legal suppression of pornography brands that today seem ridiculously domesticated, is a reality. The New York of the 50s is evoked with a movie without interruptions. The 50s Miami comes to life in a super saturated color of 16 mm. Bettie's real page seems to run, smile and pose in front of us, yet the effect is strangely light, barely obscene and not at all dangerous. <br /> <br /> How strange is the most beautiful icon of that bondage that should be so free of poison and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting.
