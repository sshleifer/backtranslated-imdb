In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show with the production of a feature film, originally scheduled for Direct-To-Video, but hit the state theatricality. It would become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we had three other features released by the boys at WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: a new female vigilante that is modeled after Batman began targeting operations run by the mafia boss Gotham Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now, Batman must try to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line. <br /> <br /> Animation is the most elegant and futuristic style that was used for the fifth and sixth season of Batman: The Animated Series (AKA The New Batman Adventures). , is quite well done, and just as elegant as the Return of the Joker animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it is less than the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero. The music was fine. Different and exotic and similar to the score of the Justice League, even if the points in the score when the old animated theme of Batman will come out will surely send waves of nostalgia through the hearts of the rodents of old fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does a great job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also nice to have the old Batman: The Animated Series pupils; this includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl, his cameo suggests the romantic relationship between her and Bruce mentioned in Batman Beyond), and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred). <br /> <br /> The bad guys were also fantastic - especially considering that Rupert Thorne, the old boss of the original series, appears for the first time since season four. <br /> <br /> 10 years ago, despite not reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm, MOTB carries the flashlight well enough for Batman's animated movies. And if you have the DVD and you're a huge fan, you'll love the five-minute short Chase Me.
