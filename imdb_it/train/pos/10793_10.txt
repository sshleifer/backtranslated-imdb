There are some spoilers in this comment !! <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments I've just read from nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and I'd like to see it as a weekly series. /> <br /> I am a fan of Judson Mills but also a big fan of Chuck Norris and while I admit that some action scenes may have lengthened the line a bit, the plot fits perfectly with other weekly series that are currently on air. <br /> <br /> The opening of fifteen minutes with Deke escaping from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very full of action. I can't see how many "professionals" weren't able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, being the hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment regarding the need to "get the film in the jar to fill the time slot after the playoffs". This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for the January air show and the filming was completed in May 2001, a full 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the United States. <br /> <br /> If the writer of the comment had paid attention to the film instead of trying to avoid it, perhaps they would have made the plot of the plot: Rashid, a character like Bin Laden, planned to start a nuclear device in the United States . The President's Man was called to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should actually WATCH the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
