I loved the fact that this film recognizes the viewer's intelligence, allowing the layers to break away from the characters through their mutual interactions about the unexpressed loss that hit each of them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone I believe is a new director of great talent with artistic maturity and intuition to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to achieve. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to focus on one goal and achieve it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on this result.
