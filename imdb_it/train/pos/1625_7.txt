A surprisingly good movie! He has a nice pair of jokes through the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extreme to show how stupid the two main characters are. We understand, stupid blondes, let's go ahead! <br /> <br /> The plot barely avoids being called "corny". And the boobies are always a plus, even if the film for some strange reason does not play with that card, even if the plot introduces two black haired women who act as a double of our two blondes. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave an 8/10, but not crazy.
