I enjoyed the cinematic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male actor wants to pass on his art to a young man even if he has no living children. The faces of the actors are wonderful to see. History reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their desire to be treated well. The works in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of the days when children were almost mobile. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me, but it deserves the time to see portrayed heroism, humanity and history.
