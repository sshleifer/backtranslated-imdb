The Plainsman is a fun western, no doubt a classic, which is current even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is as fantastic as Calamity Jane, no one I know has interpreted him better than she. Although it may not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important ones about Hickok and the time it takes. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to express your point of view and this is what DeMille does here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to the Indians by a large manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have had due to the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the uneasy relationship between Buffalo's wife Bill, a religious woman, with Hickok a man who had killed in abundance, even the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity, makes "The Plainsman" an unconventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very brief appearance, which already shows what a great actor he would have become. Great care has been taken to show the original guns of that time.
