You love it or hate it, it's hard not to find Warren Beatty's performance in "Dick Tracy", the 1990 film adaptation of the famous Chester Gould comic, to say the least a classic genre. Superhero films have come out of carpentry in recent years and may soon become a genre in its own right. <br /> <br /> The Beatty film freely uses the source material of Gould to its full effect, turning the primary colors in all six strips, and thus giving this unique and familiar world of unnatural mutant gangsters and seductive women and seductive, a visual style and a lush tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the strong visual aesthetic of the film drastically changes the characters and their acting skills, which I do not believe can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" appreciates his looks and his horrible characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the stubborn and incorruptible detective of the title, is aptly stoic and ready to smash the bad guys at any cost. <br /> <br /> In addition to the visual tricks and the Oscar-winning trick, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously exaggerated in an Oscar-nominated performance), tries to eliminate Tr acy in a well-planned move, but also tries to gain control of all the criminal actions in the city by uniting all the fighting gangs below him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tracy is juggling her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have liked, remains faithfully by her side and takes care of The Kid (Charlie Korsmo) , which in the end finds a paternal figure to keep an eye on in our hero who peddles. Tracy's loyalty to Tess is put to the test by the enticing advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), which is also the main compression of Big Boy. At the same time that all this is going down, things get hot when a new criminal figure arrives in the city, and decides to play against both sides. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, as the focus of Beatty on the tense and romantic relationships between each of the derivations becomes the center of the material, instead of focusing only on useless actions and special effects. Pacino freely chews the scenery in a role that stands out in the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic film genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he'd be proud to play Warren Beatty in his beloved crime detective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
