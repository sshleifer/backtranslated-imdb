Let's start with that theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you are caught between the moon and New York City". It's a great theme and song even after all these years, it's never tiring. It's really a nice song about New York City. However, the great Dudley Moore CBE plays the role of a spoiled drunk millionaire who is engaged to the character of Jill Eikenberry in the film. Jill later starred in LA Law. However, it is served by his wonderful English butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Oscar for his performance in the film as best supporting actor. Arthur falls in love with the character of Liza Minnelli who is perfect in this film in addition to his performance in his Oscar role in cabaret. No, Liza can't sing. She plays a maid waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as Bach's family matriarch who decides the luck of the family. However, she is fabulous and should have been nominated for an academic award for best supporting actress. Barney Martin, better known as Jerry's father on Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He is fantastic too. The film was well written, recited and delivered to the public who wanted to learn more.
