The documentary presents an original theory on "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series graphically represent several episodes that strongly support the theory and defend the theory from common criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply puzzled to find comments from users who complained about the lack of new information in these series. They say the documentary presents information that is taught in middle schools. Indeed, it does. In fact, I really appreciated the original aspect of the information I learned from the middle school and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So if you like to know why things work, if you have dismantled the phone try to determine how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how to milk the cows, you'll like it this series. A definitive recommendation.
