One of the greatest science fiction works of all time, as a visionary and inspiring as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but he is overtaken by Pitt's incredibly hectic turn that is unlike anything he did before or after. Even Stowe is not out of his league here, though. The plot is very layered and offers many things to think about. The climate scene is beautifully magnificent and the last bars fit perfectly. The scenes in the psychiatric hospital are disturbing yet so funny in their own way. A lot of black humor on display here. Fantastic production design and appropriately bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.
