This is a good example of a film that, despite its low rating, deserves more than a vision. The story is compelling and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin catches your attention. The acting is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it seems that the director cannot decide himself between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's portrait of the respectful and shy English law with S.M. the magazines hidden in the bedroom create many moments for laughter! As he looks into Nicole Kidman's eyes when he offers John his first taste of intimacy for a long time ... Other times the actors and in particular Nicole Kidman give this comedy a dramatic nuance in a fairly expert way.
