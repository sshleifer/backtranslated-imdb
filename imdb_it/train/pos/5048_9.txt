This is a very dark and intriguing horror-type thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murders. The plot centers on a deranged man who lives in Texas, in the United States, who suddenly begins to kill with his two young children after being commissioned by God to redeem the world of bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton who directs this film plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of God Killer while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performances to date as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton who decides he can no longer hold the weight of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to tell the story to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can't think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their place from beginning to end and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you won't be able to do it thanks to the power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors have filmed this film very well, and help set the plot through the good scenario. The acting in this film is great, but if there is any inconvenience, some parts are very powerful and can disturb some people. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this film is very obscure, small children help portray the idea through brilliant acting. This is really a movie that works intensely and is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat all the time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror, scary and powerful movies or anyone who wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
