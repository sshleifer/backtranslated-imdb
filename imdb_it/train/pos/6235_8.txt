This is one of the best films of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R films feature great dancing but sweetened love stories. This still has the pride of courtship, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This film presents not only great dances but also cute characters and lots of good songs. Music is the central theme here and what is beautiful is the addition of a tap solo from Rogers. Not only was she a super dancer, but a very pretty woman and one with a tremendous figure. She also dances with Fred, of course, and they are always a fun couple to watch on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 50s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, it was a real kick the first time I saw this see a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise from Ozzie fell for this beauty. Even though he had that short haircut from the 1930s, I immediately recognized his voice. Also in this film there are the quick appearances of Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I must admit that I still have to go out with Ball. I can't find it, but I know it's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, with the exception of some odious chewing gum in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - even better western - is also nice. <br /> <br /> This is simply a good movie in good spirits and beautiful if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
