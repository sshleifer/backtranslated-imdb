Although I didn't really like Stanley & Iris as a film, I admired acting. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are fantastic in this film. I haven't always been a fan of Fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to render every role he plays in golden acting. He gives a great interpretation in this film and there is a great scene in which he must take his father to a home for the elderly, because he can no longer look after him who will break your heart. I would not really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment, but I will say that you will not see much acting everywhere.
