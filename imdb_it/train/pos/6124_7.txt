This movie is silly to die for! I think it was written as a serious film, but when it came to filming, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's throw some humor and spice it up!" The characters are actually slightly developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, though, was the hairdryer. What was it?
