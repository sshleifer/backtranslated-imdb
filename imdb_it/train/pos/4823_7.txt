It is a complicated thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and imperious, on the other she must show vulnerability in a difficult situation and gather the courage and the resolution to overcome adversity, since almost all the queens films have that basic plot. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is quite as radiant as Victoria, but it's not a complete performance as I would like, no fault for her. I can't help thinking that this is an adaptation of the novel by Mills & Boon compared to a darker and more dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. So Blunt can't handle the range of queen emotions, at least not completely, since she is, you know, young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of director for the film. The last did C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and pushed him to fame. It was a rather different film, but I remember it is magnificent and probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vall√©e wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this was by Julian Fellowes, and although I really liked his Gosford Park, the story of this film was much less interesting. I was soon lost to all government policies. Perhaps it was less interesting because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy. I'm just saying.
