This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match makers with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these main roles is enhanced by a formidable cast of well-recognized actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a "feeling good"! Warm recommendations.
