The first word that comes to mind after seeing this film is "beauty". Beauty is all around, in the play of the actors (Andie is superb as always), in well-designed shots, and in the idea of ​​the authors' red line - Love. <br /> <br /> I think that the character of Kenny is the only white to identify in the otherwise boring and predictable life of these three women. His interaction makes the living character of Andie as fun as possible. When he left, it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and keep our inner beliefs and sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie successfully recovered from this loss is not bad, instead it shows that life prevails in any form, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in every way - everything it hosts and "does" and accents :))). And Andie is doing a great job again! It is a pity that this film scored so low. 10 out of ten!
