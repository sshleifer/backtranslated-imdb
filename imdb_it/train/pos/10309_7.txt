Either you like Mr. Carrey's mood or not. Me, Irene and I had an audience that walked in droves and, on the other hand, applauded and collapsed in puddles of joy. Bruce Almighty is a little more mainstream, but you've been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and I still laughed at the same gags when I saw the movie. If you don't find the sight of a dog that lowers the seat after using the funny toilet, don't worry about the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a journalist stuck in a furrow that covers "lighter news" scolds God when his whole life seems to be cooking. God accepts the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey enters the swing of having all the powers of God making the breast of his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) bigger, being promoted and responding to everyone's prayers with one-shot computerized commands. <br /> <br /> This is not the highbrow movie or even the memorable one, but it is very well done within its very limited intent, providing almost continuous laughter to Carrey fans, and even any kind of religious generosity risks being harmless to everyone except the squadders and anti-squad-god-squaders. <br /> <br /> At the most considered level, the film leads us to speculate on Carrey's career - stuck in his comedy-type comedy, which has hardly ever left an impression as a serious actor after winning two Golden Globes. His "most direct" role, the Man on the Moon, is less known for his comedy adventures - or The Truman Show (in which the Academy has accumulated three nominations while bypassing Carrey).
