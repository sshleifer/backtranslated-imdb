If you haven't seen Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wives", then you're missing out. Eva will become one of the biggest Latin stars and soon you will see her in theaters. This was Eva's first film and she did a fantastic acting job. He was 24 when he shot, and he looked hot back then. As for this low-budget film, it's pretty good for the first time director, who has another film released soon "Juarez, Mexico" currently scheduled at many US film festivals. In fact, it seems that it could have a limited release in theaters from some news. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
