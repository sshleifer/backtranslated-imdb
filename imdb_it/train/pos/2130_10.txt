A wonderful film, full of undervalued performances and intelligent and intelligent dialogues. What really distinguishes the film, however, is the subfavor of sadness around the world. The story is underlined by business, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing a job in a world where this has had disastrous consequences. Above all it was set in a world that no longer existed, and had been torn to pieces at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is barely a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. Yet it is funny - he listens to Jimmy Stewart's bitter dismissal by Margaret Sullivan and observes his pained expression as he replies that his comments were an extraordinary blend "of poetry and meanness". It's fun, focused and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten best cinematographic comedies ever made.
