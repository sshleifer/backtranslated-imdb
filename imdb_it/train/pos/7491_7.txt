Years ago, I found a copy of this film for a dollar or two. In so many ways, this is quite appropriate, as when it was done in 1933, it was really a low-cost movie produced by the "poverty" study, Majestic. However, while the film is rather derivative, it is still worth looking at and provides some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very, very familiar, as in some Germanic cities, people are angry because of some recent deaths that seem to be the work of vampires! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - even if he plays a weir very much more harmless. In this case, he is obsessed with his bats and people start blaming him for death. The film does a good job providing some "red runs" (ie false tracks) and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out that Frye may not be responsible, the WHO and WHY are intriguing and make it VERY different from the average horror movie . Also, while the production had little money to talk, he still had some good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and he also used Universal Studios sets at night (when they had finished shooting the day). As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, although I also thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible - I thought it didn't affect the movie greatly. I've seen it in more films than most people on IMDb and I've noticed that its characters have no depth - it always seems to be interpreted as the "screaming woman" and provides little new in every movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, for fans of old horror movies, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skipped.
