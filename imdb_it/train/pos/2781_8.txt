This was a lovely film. A real wellness movie when you need it. The story is light (this hasn't gone with the wind), but sometimes, one needs this kind of plot. Fun and hot characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is WONDERFUL in this role. She is certainly a new shining star for Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on her, she will be GREAT in the future. <br /> <br /> Also the soundtrack of this film was impressive. A nice mix of modern and Indian songs. I was dancing for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if a funny movie is what you need.
