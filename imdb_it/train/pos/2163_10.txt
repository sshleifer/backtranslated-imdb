I simply love this movie. It is a perfect example of the amazing all-round stories that come from Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this film, with Richard Gere and the horrible Jennifer Lopez. Please don't confuse the two films. The original Japanese film is moving, subtle and wonderfully performed. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was horrified when I first saw the trailer for the American version of Remade and who was acting there. It is the typical non-original mercantilism typical of Hollywood at its worst. The remake confirms the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The ONLY reason the original film was not seen anymore is the aversion of the American public to subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this film would never work in an American story is the reserved, ultra-socially conservative character of the Japanese public figure is being debated in this film. Surely the main character wakes up with a more complete understanding of living a lively life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from stereotypes and ridiculous ballet dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Try to see this film in its original form, not in the terrible full screen. And please skip the American remake ... it's a superficial parody with respect to the original Japanese film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the "original" film is much older, and this is simply a Japanese. It tells the story, but the only two people who will probably see this and the new US remake soon. <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I will make some brief recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I first list this for a reason, exceptional film! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian flic identity mistake! 3. Shiri: a Korean action pic that mixes both the Asian and the American storyline 4.Run Lola Run: a German film that ingeniously integrates its techno score. <br /> <br /> Well, just a short list though:)
