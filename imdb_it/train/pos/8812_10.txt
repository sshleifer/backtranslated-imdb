I saw this series when it was premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, in which two men met and told a director from each country to direct a film about 911. These directors never met before the project was completed and they saw how it all looked together. ATTENTION: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial. If you are an American, you may not like it because some of the pieces could be found anti-American. However, I know some Americans who have appreciated these series. The piece I found the best was the Indian one. It concerned the way in which a Muslim family, who lived in the United States, had 2 children and one of them had disappeared. The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that it was connected to the terrorist attack. Capture my mother's despair and the humiliation of these accusations so well, that brought tears to my eyes. Finally we see that his son died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers. This was a true story, and that was what made it so real. There were lots of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. He was humorous but powerful like the others. A must see for everyone, and hopefully America will unlock it and let it play in their country.
