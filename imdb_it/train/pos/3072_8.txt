Panic is a small gem of a movie - you think you understood it within the first half hour just to realize, with great pleasure, that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director than that. <br /> <br /> The film is built slowly, with one scene after another quietly devastating, all perfectly played by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most notable actor baby I 'I've seen for a long time, David Dorfman, as the son of Macy, who expresses his jokes as if they were completely unencoded thoughts created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this film will stay with you long after the credits have been launched.
