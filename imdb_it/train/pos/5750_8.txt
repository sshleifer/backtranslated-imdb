But the rest of us, who love a beautiful sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to make you cry..also pleasure! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is as magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is just a lot of time and tends to make questionable requests for judgment. He really wants to be a good guy, do the right thing and make his brother proud of him. He stops in church to pray at some point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character cries before the damn movie really starts. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give anything here, but the film is extremely engaging, sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, his affectionate characters and a great song that I cannot mention here, which has nothing to do with the film, but is strangely appropriate ... but you feel it in a bar. <br /> <br /> I thought that Tom Hulce would be nominated for this film, since it was for "Amadeus". I thought he could give him the inside track to really win. Not much luck. Liotta is equally good but has less emotional impact, but then does it later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here, but it was kind of you to give her name to a little drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers you will never forget.
