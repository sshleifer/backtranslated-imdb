Yes, it's imperfect - especially if you like Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a purely funny or fantasy storyline, and you can't really think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg films are for the intelligent film-goer, and Insignificance is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are brilliant, the story is excellent, but, like all of Nic Roeg's films, it makes you think of every level on the aspects of reality that you would never have seen before. His films always make you think, and personally, I like a movie. <br /> <br /> So don't expect to get out of this movie and feel happily happy, because you're likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's excellent.
