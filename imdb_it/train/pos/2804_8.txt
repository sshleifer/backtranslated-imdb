The title of this film has almost discouraged me from looking at it. Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit daunting, however I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film went fast with me without ever looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you like East is East, then you'll love this movie. OK, the plot is nothing new, and the classic stories are contained in the film, but it's all very funny and with a breath of fresh air. The film moves very quickly and keeps the audacity entertained. The funny moments are a good laugh and not a poor attempt at humor, and above all it's a good British comedy.
