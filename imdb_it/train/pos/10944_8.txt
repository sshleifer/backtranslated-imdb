Sarah Silverman's program is ... better than those other shows. No trace of laughter, no painful joke, just a program. Sarah Silverman's program. If you're like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings out there-fun, and right here-fun-at the table with ease. A mix of different styles, which he does on his own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a war of confrontation with, since it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). This show is an entity of its own, and I think most comedians will like it a lot. <br /> <br /> Go see and see.
