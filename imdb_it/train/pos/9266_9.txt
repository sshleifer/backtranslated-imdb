Ah, the best and funniest movie on female football fans, only slightly better than the teenage delirium saga of 1982 set in north London (vv). By the way, I just watched this movie on Film 4 [2008-12-21] and I'm ruining my inability to set up the PVR). <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with the addition of a guerrilla appearance by a team that apparently continues to shooting films that are forbidden in the country in which they are made (just think of the piece in which the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun goes down: fast all-round reactions). <br /> <br /> It is rare for a film to make me laugh out loud, but when the soldier in the countryside escorted one of the girls to the sinks while forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from a poster of Ali Daei, I couldn't stop waking others at home with my puffs, especially when the young soldier misunderstood my grandfather's requests for assistance ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of bathrooms, I would just like to be able to talk about Farsi so that I could process writing on the bathroom walls (yes, there were some scribbles in Roman characters, but they mainly referred to crazy American rock bands). <br /> <br /> Also, in the country and in Farsi Theme, don't you think that Omid Djalili sounds like a joke when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go "Yup". <br /> <br /> I have no intention of getting bored of Iran's sexual policy, and I have no intention of getting bored with the doubt ff; my love for this film comes from the script and the editing: first-rate stuff. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my best favorite soccer films: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. That Glory Glory Days 4. A Shot at Glory 5. The Arsenal Stadium Mystery
