Without you, I'm Nothing by Sandra Bernhard, the movie released in 1990, followed in the footsteps of her off-Broadway theater production of 1988 ... the one she and others refer to in the film as her "one- woman show "very successful. "<br /> <br /> There have been several changes in monologues and beats and the film version visually re-vamped the story, bringing Sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful performer in New York, during what she calls the his "superstar summer", an illusory, almost desperate existence at his Los Angeles home - his fictitious manager in the film refers to how to bring Sandra back to her roots, to luxury clubs like Parisian Room. "<br /> <br /> There is a point to be made here. Sandra tries to appeal to her vision of the liberal world and her sometimes harsh criticism of American pop culture to an audience that doesn't see it completely. In LA she is playing for a predominantly black audience, trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want to be "Shashonna", a stripper similar to Madonna, and even then, with Shashonna dancing to play rhythms similar to those of "Like a Virgin", there is not much to say for the pleasure of the show by the public. The scene in the club throughout the film is drier than a bone. A fun scene to capture is that of a stocky man from the audience that helps Shashonna take off his pants. <br /> <br /> But if she's going down, Sandra is doing it with style and strength, conveying everything from confidential mistrust to punctured vulnerability ... to the point in which she is naked (literally), implo acceptance and yet somehow still swims in the pool of his own transparent celebrity. His depictions of interactions with the likes of Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we believe he is) Warren Beatty are fiction and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Sandra starts her show in her most embarrassing moment, performing a quiet but mystifying version of the song "Four Women" by Nina Simone dressed in a mufti and other African dresses, singing phrases like "my leather is black "," my hair is woolly "and" they "call me sweet thing. "<br /> <br /> She resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of the art of the underworld in a tremendously entertaining description of Andy Warhol's hectic real estate auction:" Let Andy have the wisdom and sensitivity in the hours and hours of work and effort that went into the Indian product ... who were lucky enough to cash in on this whole Santa Fe affair. "<br /> <br /> Expresses the excess of Hollywood, comforting a distraught friend then admonishing him, saying" Mister, if this is about Ishtar, I'm getting up right now and getting out of your life forever because it's too self-indulgent too for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism. Dressed as a Cosmo girl, Sandra revisits her fantasy as a girl to become an executive secretary and marry her boss. "I'll never be a statistic, it's not me. I am less than 35 years old and I will get married! "Sandra exalts the openness of sexuality in society:" When it touches you at night, does it seem fair, or does it seem real? I say it sounds real ... REALLY real. "<br /> <br /> Finally, she cries for progressive change The American company has channeled the great musicians Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and proclaiming," In the end everyone will have fun! "<br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of sumptuous, schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret shows of songs written and originated by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, just to name a few. , the idealized and imaginary incarnation of Sandra - her self-generated mirror image - floats around the city, a beautiful black model with flowing dresses and tight bustiers who read Kabala, study chemistry and listen to rap NWA music. <br /> In Without you I'm Nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores the emotions and existences that until then had only played as a regular guest in Late Night With David Letterman, her almost childlike enthusiasm for shock, exhibited in1980s, he is put aside in the face of a more subtle fascination, and his confidence in American materialism and celebrity proves refreshing. This approach to comedy would forever change Sandra's direction and mark the most mature and attractive entertainer to come. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor to the point of deceiving jokes about glamor, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and superficial expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you going. It can't be thought to be fun across the board. Maybe it's a little creepy or even mischievous for some. But consider the emptiness of the world that Sandra paints for you and you will understand how fun and brilliant it is. <br /> <br /> But you see without you, I am nothing with a friend "in knowledge" because it is certainly more fun in this way. Before you know it, you two will exchange Sandra's beards and you will confuse them all.
