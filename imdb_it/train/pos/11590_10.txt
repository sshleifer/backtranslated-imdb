Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting films. Back then I was more of a movie fan. Now I enjoy renting movies and relaxing at my house rather than going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this film for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your site. Thank you ........ I am surprised to find that this short was an opening for a Disney movie. I didn't remember the Disney movie either. I didn't even remember it being an opening movie for Disney. I really wish they would show it on TV sometimes. I wonder if Disey holds the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations !!!
