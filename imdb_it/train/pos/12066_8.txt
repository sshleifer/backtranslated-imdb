It is not known if Marilyn Monroe has ever met and talked to Albert Einstein (and from the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death, we may never know), but in their lives the opportunity was there. <br /> <br /> Written by Terry Johnson from his drama, Nicolas Roeg's Insignificance imagines a meeting in a hotel room in New York one night in 1953 between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio (Busey) and Senator Joseph McCarthy (Curtis) - but only on one level. At another level, it elevates - or reduces - these "personalities" (and what a bad phrase) to simple avatars (the characters are deliberately unnamed), at the same time bigger and less important. <br /> <br /> The title Insignificance is both appropriate and profoundly ironic; here, DiMaggio's net worth has been reduced to little more than an image on chewing paper. Even Monroe is reduced to its constituent parts of clothes, hair, lipstick, movement and voice. Discovering their insecurities and reversing their roles, the film highlights the notions of celebrity, exploding the cult of personality. <br /> <br /> Continuing the theme, there will be another explosion at the height of the film: Hiroshima in a hotel suite, in which "The actress" is burned in a few seconds; a literal deconstruction of fame. Goodbye, Norma Jean. The story informs the script, which in turn, shakes the story upside down. As Roeg reflected after seeing Johnson's acting for the first time, "These characters were mythical, not invented by any single person, not by the public or the press, probably not even by the characters themselves." As played by Theresa Russell, Marilyn (an intimate intellectual in real life), holds an Einstein ("The Professor", played by Emil) as a child on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight, while the professor shows his legs, in the parody aware of her role in The Seven-Itch Itch, the film The actress is seen working at the opening of the film. <br /> <br /> The story records that Monroe's then husband, the hapless baseball star DiMaggio (played by Busey as a cute and tender psychotic), was not happy with his iconic stripper scene in film, precipitating their break. Just at the right time, we discover the jealous 'Ballplayer' in a bar, complaining that if, "I want to see his underwear, I just walk to the corner like all the other guys". <br /> <br /> Unlike The Professor, The Ballplayer believes that the universe is round - a contest shared by Native Americans. But the big boss (Sampson, of Someone Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest fame) who runs the Roosevelt Hotel elevator was almost excluded from his own culture: "I'm not Cherokee anymore - I watch TV". Meanwhile, "The Senator" is investigating The Professor, who is on the verge of delivering a pacifist speech to the United Nations, but that the suspected Senator is a red. In fact, while addressing Monroe, Einstein is destroyed by the guilt on Hiroshima and by what the future of white heat holds. And yet, in a seemingly godless universe, all these concerns and aspirations are rendered insignificant in light of a superior (atomic) power. <br /> <br /> Roeg is truly the perfect director to bring Johnson's play to the screen. In all, tormented childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forward (ka-boom!) Trace unexpected connections between time, place and circumstance, with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch used to mark time past - but perhaps also for suggest that all the time is once; every coexistent moment. As his later catalog shows, it is something of a workhorse for an enchanted director with the notion of synchronicity - see Do not look specifically. Here, 1920 bleeds in 1945 and spread in the 1980s, a period in which another actor took on his greatest role as President of the United States. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds pretty heavy in progress (quantum physics is definitely involved), the execution is far from being, due to Johnson's witty and brilliant script, of Roeg's playful direction, which opens an essentially theatrical arrangement - and of the cast itself, which are in star form. Tony Curtis in particular leaves signs of prosthesis in the wooden panels as the paranoid and impotent senator, who is seen attempting the congress with a Monroe impersonator (a real one, unlike Russell's), before being disappointed by his member in decline. <br /> <br /> Curtis once starred in the true Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot, and whose embrace he memorably described as "kissing Hitler". As Roeg commented, "Everything seemed suddenly connected ... when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this infinite bond". Everything goes into the pot, to be downsized and served in new and fascinating ways.
