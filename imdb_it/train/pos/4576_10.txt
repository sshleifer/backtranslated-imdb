I thought it was an absolutely fascinating film focused on the lives of the characters of Mary-Kate and Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton! Both are trying to make themselves and their parents happy, but; unfortunately, it's not so easy for them to actually do it! I thought it was an absolutely charming and sweet film and if you are a true fan of these wonderful ladies then I am sure you will agree with me here! If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'll tell you that you really missed it; great time, and you should take the time to see it now! This film is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
