Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome tramp who arrives in a street bar. He meets the young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her fat old husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), owner of the bar. He trades his mechanical skills with some food and lodging, and has a relationship with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Joseph, forging a car accident. Their relationship becomes affected by feelings of guilt and police investigations. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The film noir and neo-realist by Luchino Visconti is exceptional. This is the first time I watch this version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in film history, but this is definitely the best. My vote is ten.
