Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years waiting for Kabal, an evil wizard, to come and kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabal. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit confusing at first, but you soon feel part of the action. I won't give away the ending, so go see Dr. Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the movie very funny because it doesn't have much violence in it, or sexual scenes. The film focuses on the plot and that's what I like! I find that the best films are those in which the times seem to fly. This is because you are so absorbed in the film. Dr. Mordrid is a fantastic and compelling film! I give him a 20 out of 10. Worth seeing! <br /> <br />
