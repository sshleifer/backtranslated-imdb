I hate to read reviews that say something like, "Don't waste your time, this movie smells on the ice." He does it for that reviewer, but for me it might have a kind of naive appeal. If you like the other films in the "Whistler" series, this will be watchable. If you like noir movies from the 1940s, this will be watchable. <br /> <br /> This film is not good, in my opinion, as one of the first series that starred Richard Dix. It is much slower and the plot is trivial. You have seen the same narrative device used in many other films, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But acting is good, as is lighting and dialogue. Only energy is lacking and you will probably be able to understand exactly what is happening and how it will come out at the end no more than a quarter. <br /> <br /> The "Whistler" series is semi-noir and the character, the mood, the lighting, the movement of the camera and the corners are more important than the story itself. But this film is not noir. It's too light and Hollywood is innocent for that. Neither the character of Richard Dix nor those of any of his women in previous films had to end well. You never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> But anyway, I will recommend it for at least a single vision. I saw it at least twice and I got a fair amount of enjoyment both times.
