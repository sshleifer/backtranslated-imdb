This is the first review I wrote about IMDb so naked with me, but I took this movie on HBO and I was certainly glad I saw it. Richard Gere is great in this film as the passionate agent / detective who bends the rules to get the job done. I think the story is fantastic, and there is never a boring scene that slows the pace of the film. Some parts of the movie that deal with sex geeks are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to stand the scenes well. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, if you're looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low rating this film got on IMDb and surely look at it.
