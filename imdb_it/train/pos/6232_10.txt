One of the best films by Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> The terrific songs include "Let You Go Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All" My Eggs in One Basket. "The last song is introduced by Astaire who plays a jazz piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings" Let Yourself Go "with Grable among the reserve singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Rogers' mousy sister. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that accompanies you for days. It also sings "Where are you?" Fast and fast, this voice in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best: the beautiful classic and surprising finish, "Let's make music and dance" is among the best known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great clothes of the history of cinema .... a shimmering number of sequins that moves around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly visible Simply beautiful This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated in Pennies from Heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems a strange choice as a friend of Astaire but has also appeared in their Rob set with Irene Dunne. Fortunately he doesn't try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but have some scenes and have minimal impact. Allwyn has the most important role but it's OK. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the "Let Yourself Go" series .... Jazzy and thumping, it's a fantastic song. <Br /> <br /> Fun all the way, even though I got tired of "We Join the Navy" after the third time ....
