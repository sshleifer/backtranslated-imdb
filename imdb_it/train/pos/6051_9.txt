This is a great British film. A screenplay ably observed with many quotable lines, which perfectly captures what magic mushrooms can do to a man during a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent along with that of the British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles, with a rod coming out of his mouth, is a master casting and Gary Stretch with his thoughtful looks brings something oddly atmospheric to the piece. Although it seems to be advertised as a motorcycle movie, I think it will find an audience outside of this, purely on the premise that many people have been there and taken the shirt. also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This could indeed be a 21st century heir to the famous comedies of Ealing. Like the grass in the Welsh fields: he is a cultivator!
