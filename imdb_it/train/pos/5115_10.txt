I didn't see this movie in the theater. I confess to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino prejudice. Who the hell was John Travolta doing movies? I remember the Oscars broadcast that year, with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win. How dare he, when there were "real" actors in the running? I'm sorry, John, you should have won. I fell in love with the whole movie after capturing this film on cable years ago. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all wonderfully done. I also confess that I never pass it when I channel the surf. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I have learned to do most of the dialogue, to dance with my thumbs in my belt and I have learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was the supervision, on the soundtrack, of some of the music by Urban Cowboy. "Looking for love" defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was chock-full of classics that I did NOT get to the soundtrack. It should be a double CD ........
