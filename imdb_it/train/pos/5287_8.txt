This is one of the few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and even a space dog called K-9 is included. This episode of Looney Tunes is very funny, it has a reasonably good cartoon animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is rather strange, so be prepared, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian was sent to earth to capture a terrestrial creature and bring it back to Mars. With his faithful dog K-9, Marvin leaves and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but Bugs Bunny! He greets them with treats, thinking they are sweets or treated in their costumes. He does not realize that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who loves Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and the middle of the episode, you probably like this. Have fun with "Hasty Hare"! :-)
