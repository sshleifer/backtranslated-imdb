Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition should take time to watch this movie. The film is called "City Hall" and with little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. As it happens, it opens in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough experience to manage a large metropolitan city with very little effort. His right arm is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally brilliant individual whose ambitions are related to his mentor and both seemed destined for a higher position. Everything points in that direction, until a police shootout ignites an investigation conducted by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes that the sense of guilt is directed at the town hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and the death of a police officer are blamed for a career criminal whose questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political payoffs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo , corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia leaders like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Furthermore, party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works for the New York probation office, are involved. But it is the link between the mayor and his deputy that is taken over by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure candidate to become a classic. ****
