This film is simply fantastic. It was a very delicate problem and the film was superb. This film did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know) and its advertising was also kept low. Initially I thought that this film would have been simply a waste of time since most Indian directors and producers changed the theme even though it is very sensitive and adds a love story in the original story and ruins everything ... most some Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC etc. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies in India that would have become milestones or big hits if the romance part wasn't added unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> But his treatment is very similar to the Pinjar movie (also a must watch). <br /> <br /> If it counts then I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a beautiful film ..
