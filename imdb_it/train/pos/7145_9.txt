This film had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of young actors who will stay in the movies for a long time if there is justice. The direction and editing were fantastic. I could search in the book that this was adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were fantastic to see! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were funny when they were on the screen. The children at the camp could not have been better. (like I said, I liked it!)
