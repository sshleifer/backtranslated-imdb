"Hundstage" is the first fictional film by seidl (he first directed large documentaries such as "animal love" or "models"). seidl has been working on this project for over 3 years but costs only $ 2 million. the actors are very good especially the non-professional actors who have almost played themselves. Cinematography is also good. the whole movie is shocking and some scenes may be too much for "normal" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence but also that people are alone and are unable to communicate with each other. finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films of recent years. please excuse my bad english. <br /> <br />
