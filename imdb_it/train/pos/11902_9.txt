This film tells the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of low-budget horror films in the 1950s and 1960s that he sold with gimmicks. In "13 Ghosts" you need spectators to see the ghosts (they were in color, the film was in b / w). "The Tingler" had theater seats with a buzzer that made the audience jump when a monster flees to a movie theater. "Marabre" issued a life insurance policy for all members in case they were scared to death! The films themselves were pretty ugly, but you find them had people rushing to see them. In this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors in his films and his daughter. He also enters his family life and the kind of man he was (by all accounts he was a good boy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely compelling. It is very short (less than 90 minutes) and there is never a dull moment. A must see for castle fans and horror movie fans. My only complaint: there were very few sequences shown by his photos. Apart from that, it's simply fantastic.
