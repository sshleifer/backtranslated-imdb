SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people". In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau show how accurate it can be. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together. As the two begin to grow slowly more and more frustrated with each other, the laughter gets thick and fast, before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar a different and cleaner character. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon in the role of Ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic, devourer obsessed with cleanliness who faces life as a single man. Walter Matthau in contrast to the character of Lemmon is just as good as the slobbish writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are magnificent in their selected parts, to some degree dependent on the beautiful script of Neil Simon, and simultaneously because they work well as a team. Like two friends who are intrinsically different in their lifestyles, even if similar in their relationships with ex-wives and children, these two late actors create a partnership that is practically impossible to recreate. So big in fact, that the world shouted so much for something like that, two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon's, the characters were brought together in a lower sequel. This idea, while following Hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels, could have worked to a certain extent, but at the same time, it would never have succeeded in replicating the genius of this original film. <br /> <br /> After all, it's really not possible to say anything else. With Simon's incredible script, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this film had already become a hit. The casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison is the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with its traditional soundtrack (which also earned a tribute in "The Simpsons"), is an excellent script and is a genius that guides men, is a tribute to cinema and a feature to remember.
