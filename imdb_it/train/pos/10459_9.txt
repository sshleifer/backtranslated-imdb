I didn't expect to be so influenced by this movie that portrays a family like the one you'd expect to live next door. They are normal people in the flesh, not like the typical Hollywood dishes. They face an all too common problem: debilitating diseases. But the plot grabs the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, screenplay, directing and acting flow together with a wave that draws the viewer deep into history. Give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire.
