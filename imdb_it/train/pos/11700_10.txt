I have read most of the comments on this film. I have seen this film (and the whole series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, we all had fun and it simply made us meditate on what we already knew by reading and studying the Bible on kidnapping and final times. No one got scared or traumatized as I read on some posts. The film is based only on biblical facts. I have seen many end-of-time films "Tribulation", "Armagedon" and so on and this is by far one of the best at presenting Bible truths. It may not have as many great special effects as today's films, but I think it's a good testimony tool. This film and its series of prophecies can be viewed for free on this website of higherpraise.com and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.
