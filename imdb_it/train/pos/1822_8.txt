An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very moving bittersweet cartoon. I remember it very well from my childhood, it was fun, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that has escaped the pound, and is killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven and comes back. But it becomes sweet when he makes friends with an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary compared to other cartoons, like Charlie's dream sequence, but everything else was fine, and the songs were right. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love that boy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, that God rests his soul, poor girl, did not deserve to die, but is now in heaven, all good people go to heaven. Overall this is a very good animated film, a Don Bluth classic enough to put souls and Disney to shame. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have the original video of this, you will find it after the film, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, you must love that boy, ahehehe.
