I liked this movie. He was funny, cute, silly and funny. He had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons I don't really understand. No, it wasn't "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man. The story is a bit silly to be sure, but it's not dramatic, folks. I happened to see a review of the film, probably the only one I had and then I met her one night while looking for a movie. I never heard that he should have stinked until after seeing it, and I'm glad I saw it. I finally bought the VHS tape on the bargain package, and I watch it a couple of times a year.
