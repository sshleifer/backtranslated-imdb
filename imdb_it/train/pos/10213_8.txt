This extravagant film had the misfortune of being released at the same time as the famous "Amelie", both having wonderful Audrey Tautou in the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, has made one of the most entertaining films left in France in recent memories. <br /> <br /> The film is about the case, as the English title indicates. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can create havoc on the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to believe just by looking at these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director interweaves all the characters that are seen in the film and how each of them has a connection with the other, something that is difficult to imagine, but in the context of the film it seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A chance encounter on the subway sets the tone for the film. Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting in front of her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her newspaper. Irene, it seems that she will cross and find her soul mate on the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man sitting next to the woman tells her that she has the same birth date as Irene. It seems that they are destined to each other from the beginning, but unfortunately they will not be reconnected until the last frame of the film. Audrey Tautou is as wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, doesn't have much to do until the end, but shows he has a presence and plays his part well. The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as a butterfly's wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to future Laurent Firode films because they seem to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected.
