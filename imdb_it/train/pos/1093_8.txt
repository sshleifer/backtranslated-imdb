I always like this movie when it shows up on TV. <br /> <br /> The only scene that always stands out for me, that is, is the one with Myrna Loy and the foreman of painters, where she gives him very explicit instructions about colors and as soon as she leaves, she transforms his boys and says "You understand, it's yellow, blue, green and white"
