I became a fan of the television series "Homicide: Life on the Street" at the end of the series, but I became a fan very quickly. It was a police show unlike any other: visually different in its use of portable cameras, which took the viewer everywhere, with its multi-ethnic and multi-racial cast and their different and fascinating personalities, and which covered all the good and evil a police department, including corruption clashes and surface personalities. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The Movie, the sequel to the series, is as good as a movie made for television. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now candidate for mayor of Baltimore, was killed, the cast members of the series are back to help find the killer. Moreover, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and the fire that marked the series return, and the script is fraught with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a fantastic TV movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
