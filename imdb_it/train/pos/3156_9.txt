Like the characters in this show, I too was a teenager in the 1970s. The producers really nailed the entire zeitgeist, to be a suburban teenager in the 1970s. The fashions of the 70s, the machines, the furnishings for the home, food and fashions are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show boasts a cast of highly talented ensembles that blend seamlessly into the camera. I really like unique movie sequences, in a psychedelic style. No other show does camera tricks like this. These avant-garde film sequences really help to convey the attached atmosphere that characterizes the 70s era. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a very fun sitcom. The only thing that bothers me about this show is the excessive reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughter. In this way, I think this show is too similar to Married With Children. While Married with Children is a great stand-alone comedy, it's unlikely that the creators of That 70s show continue to try to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend That 70s Show, mainly for its nostalgia factor. It could be an even better show, if the writers relied more on witty dialogues, rather than obscene and sleepless jokes and jokes.
