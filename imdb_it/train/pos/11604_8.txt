In the seemingly endless quest to find well-made and well-made horror films, it is far too rare to find one that remotely approaches the point of hitting the target. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I ran into "Burned at the Stake" on a US cable network while I was flipping through the channels. The premise is reasonably simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most explicit witness against the alleged witches, paving unfounded accusations against anyone who displeases her. Manipulating her for her own ends is Reverend Parris (Peters) who also serves as the court's guide on matters relating to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann begins to accuse members of the Goode witchcraft family. Salem (circa 1980), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in clothes from the seventeenth century tries to approach her there and the building. He continues to haunt her as strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more. Soon, it looks like you are becoming possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, a further description is rather involved and would give too much space. Although the film is not action-oriented and probably does not interest many viewers a lot, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks seems very convincing. The production values ​​are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects. In a side note, the film's technical consultant was Laurie Cabot, the official Salem witch. Viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric but undervalued horror film might appreciate it. The writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction and is best known for his work on numerous "big bug" films and similar works years before.
