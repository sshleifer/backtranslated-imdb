There were some great moments of reality that represented modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). Show how stifling culture can be, and want to get out of the mold that was created for you. <br /> <br /> Dancing was just a way to say "do what you love even if it's against the norm". Rather Billy Elliot as I would say. I liked that movie too. <br /> <br /> The humor was well organized, and the touching moments were so real that one could feel the embarrassment between Sugiyama and his wife, the whims in the ballroom. I loved Aoki - he and that wig and his eccentricity on the dance floor just made me howl! <br /> <br /> The actors did a great job, the story was well written. I looked at it a second time and noticed some minor nuances that I missed in the first vision. Have fun!
