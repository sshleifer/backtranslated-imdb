Jim Carrey's vehicle amusing enough that he has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and destroys the wrecks. Carrey is back on familiar ground and seems to enjoy herself, and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is also charming and engaging. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is exceptional and makes the film worthy of note. GRADE: B
