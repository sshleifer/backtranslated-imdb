I had the chance to see a screening of this film recently. I think it will be in Canadian cinemas for some time around Mother's Day. If it's in a theater near you ... GO! It is not a funny and amusing film - it is more along the lines of a film of sensations and thoughts. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of character development - letting you get into Hagar's heart, mind and wounds little by little. At first, his attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. As his story develops, he becomes a person you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found it nice for the end of the film - especially when it opens the heart to the young man in the shack near the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two children is painful - and reflecting so many of our experiences in this world. The younger son, John, who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the limit of his own place - and in that kind of pure emotion that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see Ellen Page play in this movie. It is very different from the young woman who plays Juno. It gives me an even greater appreciation for his acting ability. If you loved Juno, you will love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power to act so strongly as the actor's ability to make you forget every other character you've ever played. Never once in this film have I ever thought of Ellen Burnstyn - I have only ever thought of Hagar. He overwhelmed me in his character - love, line and platinum. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to capture this famous book by one of Canada's most beloved authors is impressive. Bring brightly on the screen both stale and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - the stone angel.
