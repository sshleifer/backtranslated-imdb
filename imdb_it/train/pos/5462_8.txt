First of all, if you're going to watch this, make sure you watch the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to go back and look at the scenes that have been tampered with because of the censorship), it makes a big difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has been forced into prostitution by her father since the age of 14. When her father suddenly disappears, she is able to go out into the world alone. After reading Nietzsche's philosophies of life, he uses his sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what he wants and leave them in ruins and desperate for his love. Throughout the film it becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the public begins to wonder if it has a sense of morality left to everyone. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking film with blatant sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white movie. Although no explicit sexual acts are shown on the screen, it is obvious what is happening outside the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I think the most modern audience will get at least some fun if, especially with the shock value of the movies. I thought as I watched that the rhythm seemed a bit slow in some parts, but I think most movies see it for the first time. In fact, I think that almost all the films I saw made in the early 1930s had minor stimulation problems or some parts just didn't "flow" correctly. Was this probably just the art of making movies that wasn't perfect yet? it would take a few more years. Compare a 1939 film and compare it to a 1930s movie and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am very happy to have witnessed the original cut; it really makes a big difference. Even John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an unusual role.
