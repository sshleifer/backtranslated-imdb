This film has it all. Gag of sight, subtle jokes, word games and verses. It is a group of boys of different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look at it more than once, you will find that you are quoting it as Animal House (and I also love Animal House). I entered the first 15 most entertaining films. The major in a military academy for boys is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this film he is right). He is sadistic, indifferent, cruel and must be overthrown. The group of kids who don't get along at the beginning end up collaborating to survive and get rid of the major with an extravagant plan that only Mad Magazine could write. A must see - you will love it!
