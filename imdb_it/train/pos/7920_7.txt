Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> Tony (Arkin) is the average normal type of high school. Preparing for the big game of homecoming, girlfriend problems and growing hair in strange places, you know the usual. But the hair in strange parts gets a little out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case of fur balls. Now condemned to walk the world forever as young as a werewolf, how will Adam have girls? <br /> <br /> "Full Moon High" is not often spoken, but it is a stupid and intriguing parody of horror. Larry Cohen (Q the Winged Serpent, The Stuff) incorporates all the gags that he can find as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 Years Later) shows good timing in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of parodies like "Airplane" and "Student Bodies" I think you'll have fun with this celebration.
