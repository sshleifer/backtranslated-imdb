Rated E (Contains Violence). <br /> <br /> I had the original Spiderman PC game for a couple of years. I haven't defeated it yet because on Windows XP there is a problem on a level that I can't beat because of it. To be warned if you have XP. But for those who don't have XP give this game a try. Its fun clean family game with action and is great for any Spiderman fan. In the game you play Spiderman and you face different criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to all Spiderman fans or parents who want a fun and clean game for their children. <br /> <br /> 8/10
