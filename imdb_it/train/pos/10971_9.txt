Gray Gardens is shocking, fun, sad and mesmerizing. I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. squabbled and performed as they recalled their past. Their existence in a ruined villa (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a film that you will not soon forget.
