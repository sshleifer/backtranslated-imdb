Val Kilmer ... I hate it or hate it, sometimes it gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go "Hey! This guy is a GREAT actor!" He did it in Jim's leather pants in The Doors and did it again in John's leather panties. <br /> <br /> Walking around the fall and autumn of the super porn king John Holmes, Kilmer kneels as we reveal one of the most Great mysteries of the murder that Hollywood has never solved for over twenty years, with Holmes the main suspect in a brutal Manson-style massacre. <br /> <br /> What Kilmer does without effort is to exhume the low life of celebrity, doing anything to anyone you crave that overwhelms whoever had it and then lost it. Go see it, you'll understand what I mean.
