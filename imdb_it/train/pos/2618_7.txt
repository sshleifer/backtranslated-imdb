Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> Watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I couldn't help feeling mixed feelings about the whole movie. It's definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing that can give you the same kind of feeling that The Lion King did. The story, for those who have not read other reviews, talks about how Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they influence events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There are actually some very funny movie jokes. My favorite part is when they show the couple who raises Simba. However, for me the worst parts must be when they show that Timon and Pumbaa directly interfere with the events of the original. I can never watch the sequences of "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" in the same way (I agree with the sequence "I Just Can not Wait to be King"). <br /> <br /> Vocal talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, as does Matthew Broderick, the guy who does Rafiki and the hyenas. Even the actor who plays the young Simba played quite like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me. But why did they also include a voice actor for Zazu? It had literally only 2 lines, nor were they necessary. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent, even if you still can't hear the voice of Timon's mother and don't think about Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that don't seem to fit the original, what comes to mind when I'm rock pride at the end. How did they have time to adapt to the initial clash with hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, you can't help but think that for a set of 2 discs, the special features are particularly lacking. They could easily have entered a comment or other format on the first disc. I liked the game "Who Wants to Be the King of the Jungle", although it is the most shameful example of cross promotion I've ever seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, although not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
