A young man named Court is loved by everyone. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer. You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. Whether predictable or not, and regardless of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story, full of environment and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Another thing, someone said that his fate was so fast that it didn't seem plausible. But the elements for this are subtly set. Notice what his mother says to bring his lunch on the field. Notice how he keeps the steering wheel and his gloves. He is sweating and runs dangerous equipment. Until now, tractors are quite dangerous.
