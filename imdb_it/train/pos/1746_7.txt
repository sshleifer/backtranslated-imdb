Bela Lugosi plays one of his rare good boy roles in a serial based on the long radio success (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played the villain). Lugosi cuts a charming and sad figure and he is sad he didn't have more roles where he could be the guy in charge in a good way. Here Chandu returns from the East to help Princess Nadji who is chased away by the leaders of the Ubasti cult who need her to bring the high priestess of their cult back from the dead. This is a nice time for trotting on the globe which is a lot of fun. To be sure, the pace is a bit loose, more like one of the principals (production studios), so an amazing adventure, but it's still fun. This sounds better than the two films that were cut because it allows things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or feeling that "hey I missed something". One of the trilogies of three serial coupons made by Lugosi, the others are SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
