"The Lady in Question (1999)" with Gene Wilder is a well-played mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black and white series by Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and "Cash" made me guess until the end. There were many suspects with a reason for the murder, but I had no idea which character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a fascinating special intelligence about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections that make him perfect for the part. The parts of the film that portrayed the acting were very well done. I'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull out. I'm not surprised to see that he wrote part of the film. His singing was also a delight. I like this role more than his previous "more silent" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope that A & E continues this series. They should call it something like "The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries". <br /> <br /> The music adapts to the period. I liked the fantastic live combination and the swing melodies. At first I was a bit confused if we were seeing a flashback or if the action was going on at that time. And I don't agree that the inclusion of vulgarity is necessary for the flow of the script. For me, this always distracts me. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I enjoyed this second part in a well-made start to what we hope will be many others - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Burr's Perry Mason.
