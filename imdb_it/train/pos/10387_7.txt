After reading some of the other comments, I was expecting something really terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CONTROL: the original series was not so good. I think some people remember him with more affection than he deserved, but apart from Daisy Duke's car chases and legs, the scripts were weak and poorly managed. The Dukes were too clever and snobbish about the backwood balls, the Boss Hog, which had shrunk, was too stupid to be bad and Rosco was simply hyperactive at all times on the screen. It's amazing that the series lasted long enough because it ran out of the lines of the story during the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you watch this movie in its own way, not as a direct comparison with what you remember from the TV series, then it's not bad at all. The real star is of course General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and this is really what D.O.H. It's all based on. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric ego and together with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo, the couple makes this movie really fun in a hilarious way the TV series have never been achieved. The adorable Jessica Simpson is a young lady like Daisy, Burt Reynolds is much better at Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes Rosco P. Coltrane credibly bad, as he always should have been. <br /> <br /> If you don't like slapstick humor and crazy car stunts, then you won't watch this movie because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want a fun action movie with some good laugh that isn't too hard for the brain, then go see this fun romp with an open mind.
