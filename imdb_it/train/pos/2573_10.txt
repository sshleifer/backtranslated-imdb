When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there's a movie that they insist on watching over and over again: you guessed, K-911, the third installment of the hit K-9 series starring everyone father of favorite TV, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> People, I knew it was possible to wear a VHS tape, but a DVD ?! This has been played so often that it is starting to jump; no joke! But of course you will have it when you have a film so fascinating, so brilliant. <br /> <br /> Obviously, we have to thank the only Tom Hanks for letting us know about the beloved Cop-Dog genre with Turner and Hooch; however, even that film is not up to the excellence presented in all three K-9 films. Some no-sayers say that Belushi has run out of forces with this third film in the series. Poppycock, I say. While it is suspected that a third installment - direct-to-video, at that point - may not seem like something worth looking at, you'll verify that you've made a mistake after seeing this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not let him give up the plot, but I will say that Belushi and his panting partner still give their best performance - one that will make you scream with laughter! It's a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see what big steps his brother has made in the acting world. I highly recommend that your teenage daughter present this film to her best friends at her next sleepover party. Don't forget the puppy!
