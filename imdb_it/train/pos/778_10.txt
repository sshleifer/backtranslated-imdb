I am not a great expert on acting or other films, but this film has impressed me deeply. I don't think I'll ever forget it. One scene in particular (I think anyone who has seen the film will know which of the two I speak) is imprinted on my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched the similar movie Lilja 4-ever (as reported by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not entirely linear and brutal. If you are sensitive, or will bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) may stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing argument, but I think, no, I hope the film gets more attention to it. <br /> <br /> Other people need to see this movie !!!!!!
