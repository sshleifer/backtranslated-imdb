What I like about this show is that it follows the life of modern witches and it is an explosion to experience their daily love, humor and adventure. The literature of magic is so different that it portrays the ideas of classical, medieval and modern magic, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Witch, this show is so fun and unique because it allows us to experience many of modern magic, it's worth seven seasons! This show has so many great qualities and it is a joy to see Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and "other" realm. I would recommend it to any family because the TV series is clean, fun and adventurous. Classic!
