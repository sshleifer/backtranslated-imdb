I finally saw these episodes in 2008 and I had to constantly go back and check when they were actually produced. They are absolutely frightening in the fact that they have made room on the fun of what the future would be. O Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush or they are strange and disturbing people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Did the Bush brothers invade the White House dressed as Arabs armed with rifles? Does Bush "accidentally" run anyone? (No, wait, he did it in a sense.) At the time it might have seemed like a failure like a sitcom, but now it must be considered a brilliant, albeit unpleasant, prescience.
