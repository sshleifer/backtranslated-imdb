Isn't "Der Todesking" exactly the kind of movie that makes you happy? The second cult monument by Jörg Buttgereit in a row, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", is there seven short episodes ?? one for each day of the week ?? turning to suicides of unrelated people. Among these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly terrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes are not all equally powerful but, as healthy, "Der Todesking" ranks rather high on the list of the most depressing house art films of all time. In particular, the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man who explains his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one on Sunday, centered on a younger man who is harassing himself to death, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film, or any other type of shockum like this, is questionable and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any kind of message to communicate here. There is a vague reference to a mysterious chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but for the most part we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically. Entirely different from what I expected, "Der Todesking" is not an exploitative or repulsive graphic! On the contrary, in reality, I could never have hoped that Buttgereit was so subtle and thoughtful about the representation of pure human misery. Thursday's episode is a perfect example of this, as it shows in style different points of view of a famous German bridge while on the screen appear names, ages and occupations of people jumping out. Production values ​​are inevitably poor and assembly often lacks professionalism, but this is not what really matters in this type of cinema. The argument is strong and forces us to contemplate the less cheerful ?? but also indispensable ?? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music, too!
