If you read only a synopsis of the plot, this film would look like a typical 1930s film. The story would seem completely artificial, the maudlin argument. The strength and beauty of this film are in the cast's direct and worldly interpretations. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow show such a range of feelings, rich and subtle nuances floating on his face. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such a depth of feeling among the main characters. The raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably moving: when Clark Gable looks down with so much joy and surprise from his son, he lifts it up and proudly says: "My son!" for him posthumously. This is one of the best examples of Depression cinema.
