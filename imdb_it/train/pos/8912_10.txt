I have read many comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being cheese or campy. The film has been criticized for amateur acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience was in the production of Christian Shorts, low budget, produced locally (Valley Forge PA). Let me tell those overly critical critics that this film has never taken this seriously. This fact should be evident from the disharmonic theme music complete with silly texts reproduced on the opening titles. For what it was supposed to be, this movie is excellent. I saw some of the recent very low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, which has absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thinking behind the plot. The BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted and very funny. The scene in which the old meets the meteorite and spits out the mass contained inside with a stick has been excellently realized and genuinely disturbing. The scene in the doctor's office with the Blob moving slowly under the blanket on the stretcher while consuming the old was a cinematic masterpiece of horror. The bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to take $ 120,000.00, inflated to the value of today's dollar, and make a movie somewhere near as fun or successful as the Blob. It cannot be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
