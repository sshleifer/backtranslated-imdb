This is a very dramatic and suspenseful film. There are many plots and turns. The story or the director opens up questions about death row or alleged crimes committed by people of color. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the excellent sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this you do not miss "TRUE CRIME" or "L'ORRIO". My wife and I gave 8/10.
