Played by: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really rather skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual INCUBOUS. Jim Carrey who plays God? Nothing is more sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is hardly sacred, but neither is it sacrilege, at least not to a large extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he's not God. Confused? I'll give you the bass. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a journalist who has no luck and feels very unlucky in his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right away that they love each other, but the relationship is on a rather shaky ground. <br /> <br /> So Bruce gets an anchorman shot, just for sneakily stealing it from Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television in a way that is comical and certainly worthy of getting him fired. <br /> <br /> Very complaining and complaining about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of calling it, then he answers and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the chief electrician and janitor of the building. I found this very funny. God is the head, the Holy Spirit is the electrician and Jesus Christ is the janitor. Think about it. Chief, of course. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess the world has left. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> However, Bruce is a bit skeptical about meeting God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a chance to interpret God, he starts to believe it a little. I wonder why. Enter the flagrant power abuse for personal gain and abuse enemies. <br /> <br /> As this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously gets brighter, learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world. Eventually he cries out to God to take him away and prays that his will be done, not Bruce's. <br /> <br /> Given that it is Jim Carrey, the film is pretty funny, and there are certainly some entertaining moments in it. The film is not a perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is certainly a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite inspiring and even stimulating, and I congratulate Tom Shadyac for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> So, even if far from perfect, definitely a fun popcorn movie with a little background. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)
