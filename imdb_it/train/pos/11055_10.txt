Well, what can I say, besides these people they are Super in every way. I really like Sharon Mcreedy, I like this pure Nostalgic series and I have the set of 9 discs in box of 30 episodes, I didn't realize that they had made so many, I also think it's a great sin, that they didn't do more . I'd like them to have given me these powers, imagine me, being knocked out of my cycle, somewhere and being thrown out cold, then waking up in a special hospital. Later, I find that my body has been improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you can't fight these 3 people, since they would defeat you with all their weapons. The music is well written, and for me, it puts a fantastic image of 3 super-beings in my mind, the kind of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cat, improved vision, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was nice and smart. When I was a boy, I had a big crush on her !!!! Now I understand why, on my DVD set. The box is very beautiful and comes with a free brochure on the series. I also thought that Trymane was a good leader, stopped but did things!
