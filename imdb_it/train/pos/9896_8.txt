I'm going to see this movie in the last few months. I was really surprised at how beautiful it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly mistreat him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty horribly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers is invited to return to their high school, which is now abandoned for a party. Although, none of the reckless teenagers organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later, through the film, the boys begin to die as gruesome as possible. I can certainly tell you that they are also bloody. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, discover that it was all a dream and that nothing happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Even if the murders didn't happen, the burns and jokes apparently happened. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible but it's okay. <br /> <br /> I love history. I really like Marty. He is like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what is coming from them at the end and end up feeling satisfied for the victim who gets their sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone who picks it up if you are looking for 80s slashers. /> <br /> I gave this film 8 stars out of 10. Good cheese slogan!
