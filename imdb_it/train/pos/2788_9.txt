This is a so-called "feeling good" movie, but it has made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents didn't allow me to study at the sports academy, as well as the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to leave football. <br /> <br /> And soccer is the red line in this film. Along with the struggle, young people have parents' expectations. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the English family with a daughter who dresses as a boy and plays soccer ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also shows the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living your only life (where we've heard it before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful woman!) She plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, tricks and the typical 17-year-old girl's stuff. In contradiction with her sister Pinky, she completes the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> A real must, to see how a young and beautiful girl struggles with her parents' traditions and eventually finds her fortune. With great music by Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hit songs. <br /> <br /> Nice to look at, but if you, like me, had ever played soccer, and would never make it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
