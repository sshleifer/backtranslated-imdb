This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite films from Pabst and I liked it a lot more than his most famous films played by Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). Probably because both are very similar to the neorealist films that the Italians perfected in the 40s and 50s. This style film involved the use of non-actors (typical people) in everyday contexts to create intensely engaging and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, people in the roles look like miners, not actors. The central conflict at the beginning of the film is that there is a large mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, although there is more unemployment in Germany. This, the linguistic differences (wonderfully illustrated in the scene of a ballroom) and the First World War conspire to create a huge rift between the factions - resulting in a WE vs. mentality. THEY. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit down and do nothing. Risking their lives, they show that there is a real camaraderie between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and has tried in vain to convince the German public to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a beautifully moving film with some of the scariest and most claustrophobic images I've ever seen. Considering the story, however, the impact of the film was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as this, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but in the end it was the failures in public opinion that oscillated positively. So, from a historical point of view, it is an incredible and sad relic that is worth seeing.
