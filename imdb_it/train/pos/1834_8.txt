This is a very touching film. I don't care what people say about this movie, this is a great movie. The performances of the role of Amitabh Bachchan have dying father is great, because he wants to teach his son how to manage life in case something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as spoiled Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty who played the role of Sumitra Thakur was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role in the film. Ragpal Yadav as the dead servant in the brain and Boman Irani as the unfortunate father-in-law have a very good connection and the comic scenes were hilarious. The management is very good.
