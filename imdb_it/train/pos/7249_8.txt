For me it is difficult to assign the "right" number of stars to this film, but I opted for 8 for its high production values ​​and for what was an innovative approach to war films in 1968. Also remember that I haven't seen him since 1969. But he had a strong impression. <br /> <br /> Long Day's Dying must be one of the most vivid anti-war films ever made. It achieves this simply by describing in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in Northwestern Europe in 1944-45. No film before this has shown war on the infantry level with so many brutal details, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenario. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is not even subtlety. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters appear as flat and familiar clichés. As "entertainment", the film does not make it, even if it was clearly not intended to "entertain". It was meant to make you jump into the head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern warfare in general. This was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before Saving Private Ryan, both films much more "watchable". Here the flat and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of a real plot and realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first vomit on the screen in theatrical history) make the film difficult, even if they are only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you will have when it is over, a bonus star for having the heart in the right place. Media: 8. <br /> <br /> Like "The Victors" by Carl Foreman, underestimated "The Victors", an equally negative but more interesting and stimulating film, The Long Day's Dying doesn't seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been in cable a number of times.
