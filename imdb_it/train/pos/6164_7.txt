Are we really doing 'video nasties' again? In the guise of an 8MM remake of a large digital screen, this is a nice ride. Unfortunately there is a little too much history and sometimes this becomes a travelogue while our heroine searches in the places of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. They are still rather frivolous for the "depraved" scenes, including everything, hot wax, harsh lashes and rough sex for drowning, beheading and others. These scenes are immaculate and it is a pity that Bruno and his budget failed to make all the many character creatures introduced more than just caricatures.
