A rather mediocre but courageous film by Mrs Hawn to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer and as a protagonist vehicle. Although she ends up being avenged, she is willing to paint herself as the whimsical child. How many other actresses listed on A have had a head accident after this movie? Not many. Does this mean that the female ass can't be fun? Goldie surpasses other actresses because she has kept a character on screen and ventures into projects that others do not. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, for example, Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman would never have faced the crisis. A wonderful interpreter. It's nice to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYoung in particular.
