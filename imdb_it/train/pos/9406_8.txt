Other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join my admiration for this little gem of a film. In fact, he holds well over 50 years later in every category - screenplay, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really a classic of all kinds. This was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and it is obvious from the first frames that made him so special that he eventually received a knighthood. <br /> <br /> I consider it only an "8" because it is essentially a rather light parabola that examines human nature but does not really peel it; and because the plot takes the easy way to the end, rather than resolving the conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are pursuing him throughout the city. Furthermore, a couple of minutes of reflection reveal the fundamental defect in the logic of the script: wear is almost never the determining factor in the purchase of new clothes (especially clothes); children grow, people change size, gain and lose weight, and always go with the latest fashions, and have plenty of time that the looms have woven. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would produce a fortune by supplying indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. If you have the chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
