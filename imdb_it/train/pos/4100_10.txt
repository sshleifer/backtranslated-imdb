"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée.Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress engaged to the son of a poor Marquis, arrives at the crumbling castle of the family and learns of The mythical bear animal is destined to wander in the nearby forest. It is a fairy tale that a former landlady (Sirpa Lane), once engaged in perverse sex with the creature, finds herself consumed by the dreams of the accident. "The Beast" is a mix of surreal horror art-house, explicit sleaze and porn. There is understood bestiality, assault and perversion in the priesthood, copious fake ejaculate smeared with bare breasts, masturbation with a rose and, above all, the graphic of the homonymous beast that plays with an incredibly large phallus. Yet this genuinely erotic film is beautifully photographed and tasteless. The women here are incredibly beautiful and are naked most of the time. Overall, "La Bête" is a visual feast. Attention to detail, or information-laden visual motifs, Borowczyk's masterpiece should be viewed with care and attention. Not to be missed for fans of European cult films.
