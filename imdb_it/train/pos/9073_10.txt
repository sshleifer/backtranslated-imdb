My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this movie and we were really delighted with the hilarious fun of the movie. It has an extra charm for boys and men who remember their childhood, but women also appreciate the film and especially the refrain of Hallie Kate Eisenberg, "The boys are so weird". It is refreshing to see a film that shows unequivocally that boys and girls are really different in their emotional and social composition. Kids really do this kind of strange thing and usually survive to tell the story and scare their silly mothers! We liked the film so much that my son and an 11-year-old friend of mine, my daughters and I, 23, went to see the movie the next day for a day of boys. We had even more fun the second time and everyone loved it. It is clean and deliciously performed by a pre-adolescent cast reminiscent of the classic "Freaks and Geeks" TV. We all think that it will become a surprise success not unlike "Freaks & Geeks" that has not survived its first season but has exhausted its release on DVD. You see it especially if you have kids and you will find it stimulating conversation about fun and safety! The girls will love him for the opportunity he offers, "The boys are so weird!" Not to be missed ...
