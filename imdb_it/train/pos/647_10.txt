Well, of course not, women are on average overly sensitive and needy, which is interestingly interpreted from mother to whore, even if it's not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or vaguely busy. Unlike many of you I have only seen La Maman and La Putain twice. Like many good films, I noticed that my opinion improved after a second viewing. All I know is what I've seen and I have yet to go into further exploits until I've acquired the DVD. I still have to figure out exactly why I like this movie so much, but really, what does it matter to me? Although I'm sure I could and I will make a wonderful explanation. Okay, so you might not agree, maybe sometimes it's a bit boring, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a lovely Grushenka.
