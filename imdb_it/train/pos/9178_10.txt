I really have to say that this has always been my favorite when I went to visit my grandmother. And it still is. It is very, very close to the book. The way it turned, and the players were all excellent! I have to recommend this film to all those who have not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but this was really cool! I gave it 10/10.
