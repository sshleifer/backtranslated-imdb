I immediately noticed that this film was not based on the novel by Dodie Smith. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo's son Perdita now had his puppies. The nicest of the Dalmatians was, of course, the little snowball that was completely immaculate until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely. In fact, I often thought about the possibility that she might become friendly, but now that she has returned so quickly to "herself" again and announced she is again Cruella, I have almost begun to really worry about Chloe's Dalmatians. > <br /> Actually, the scene where the puppies looked at Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin were having dinner, was much better than I expected. I also liked the parrot that played to be a dog, and it was incredible that dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I was glad that in the end the Dalmatians had been saved again, but I would have liked to know what would have happened to Cruella after losing all her property. And what the hell could a dog house do with that much money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was quite moving that Snowball also had points at the end of the film.
