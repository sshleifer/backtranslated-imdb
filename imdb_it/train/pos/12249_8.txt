Old Jane's manner of speaking seems very popular these days. I lost count of the number of versions in circulation. Probably the reason is that his "furrows" are our "furrows" even at this late date. This television miniseries offers an educational way suited to the novel. Stubborn, thoughtful Emma is a rather "modern" girl when you think about it, although the atmosphere of Jane Austen's world may seem a bit artificial to us today. If you don't look EMMA, I'll just say that self-sufficient Emma gets her just punishment. It is worth looking to find out how. The honors of the actor go to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have a psychic connection with old Jane!
