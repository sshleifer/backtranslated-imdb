A true classic. Beautifully filmed and acted. It reveals an area of ​​Paris that is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the area of ​​"Hotel du Nord" and the Hotel itself still exists, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and as joyful as it used to be. The film makes you want the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and sweetness.
