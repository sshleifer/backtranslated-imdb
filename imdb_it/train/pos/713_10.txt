this movie is fantastic kind of. dosent really says a lot, or does a lot, but it's a fantastic movie to watch because of how stupid it is. the high school is seized by theirtical ms.togar who hates the one thing that all students love, rock & roll. randle riff get all tickets for the ramones show, and this movie peaks with a school control outlet brought my randle riff and ramones. this film has everything, a bad screenplay, questionable direction, bad actors (ie clint howard and pj soles), an impressive soundtrack, extreme acceptance, these elements and much more come together to make this what it is, a classic . <br /> <br /> notes - during the live ramones set, note that the germs are crashing in the front of the crowd. neat-o.
