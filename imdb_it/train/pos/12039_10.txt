The Woman In Black is fantastic in all respects. It's scary, full of suspense and so realistic that you can actually see it happen in real life. I saw it for the first time on TV in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume turned up, it was probably the most disturbing experience of my entire life. I managed to get a copy of it, and now, I make sure to take it out every Halloween and show it to family members, unaware of me, who have no idea what they are, and all I can do is laugh with joy. Regarding the film: <br /> <br /> Start with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is assigned by his company to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to deposit the documents of a recently deceased customer - Mrs Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a fairly solid and interesting ghost story. But then, Arthur attends the funeral, and from that scene on, we don't feel safe. We are constantly nervous and we bite our nails, and we go on for an hour or so, until the last electrifying end. <br /> <br /> A warning to all new spectators: do not watch it alone. ..
