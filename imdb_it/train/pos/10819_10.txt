Of course, this film was not like 16 blocks, inside the man, an American haunting. etc ... <br /> <br /> But it was a great mystery that can happen to any of us .. I found this film really fantastic and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed this movie "san pedro, California" And we heard true stories based on episodes of this film. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you've heard of the famous boat in the long beach "Queen Mary" Well that boat is haunted. I believe in spirits, in illusions and in parallels or in any case spelling. it's real. everyone is inside their own universe. <br /> <br /> and the mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. it's fantastic, and it's not bad at all by the director. <br /> <br /> for those who judge him 1. do not understand the film. its meaning. its plot, its view. and how bad life in the ocean can be for any of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
