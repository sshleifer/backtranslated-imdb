The history of peace-loving peasants and of citizens fighting over land, water, law and order, and the respect and final submission of long-established interests in cattle and their hired tools had been improved previously (Shane) and probably in subsequent films as well. There are some good action scenes and the general layout of the story, excluding a disappointing ending, is well executed. Law, order and religion have established roots in the city, but the old order of cattle, cowboys and gunslingers is still in circulation. The clash between the two takes place in a well-arranged ambush scene where citizens ride straight into a trap. Granger, a former gunman, plays the boy who is avoided by the same citizens who need his experience with a gun.
