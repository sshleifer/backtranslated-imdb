This film was excellent: the emotional strength of the interpretations of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film were released in late 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would have been at least nominated for an Oscar for best actor. Definitely worth seeing!
