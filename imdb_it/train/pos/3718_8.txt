This was a good movie. It wasn't your typical war movie, but something a little different. This film showed us recruits in pre-war training and not actually fighting a war. This film is one of the most realistic views on war and the army than many other films like this one do. Colin Farrel did a great job in portraying an army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and even Matthew Davis did quite well. Seeing Colin Farrel moving from b to level in a few years, you never thought it would happen. I will also add that tigerland producers did a great job filming a movie in 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a nice touch. It's nice to see the talent used wisely and I hope to see this same talent again in the near future.
