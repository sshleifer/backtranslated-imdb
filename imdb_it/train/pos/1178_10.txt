This could be the second best WWE PPV of the year after Wrestlemania was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent game in which he shocked Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy kept his IC title in a short sloppy game with Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley won a fairly violent table game on Benoit and Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a great match with Kidman which surprised me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a no dq match, at one point Booker T kicked the Big Show with scissors and sent it directly across the table. In a stupid decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with great help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the match of the evening in which he was filled with excellent high points and RVD got his title of champion with a DQ so I was happy to have kept the title. Triple H has also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw which means little or nothing. And in the main event, Rock became the first 7-time WWE world champion to defeat both Kurt Angle and Undertaker in a triple threat game. Overall, this is probably the second best WWE PPV of 2002! 7/10
