This is a docudrama story about Lindy Chamberlain's case and a look at its impact on Australian society. In particular, it examines the problem of insinuations, gossip and expectations when it comes to real-life dramas. <br /> <br /> A topic that the story addresses is how people are expected to give the same emotional response to such situations. Not everyone gets into wild melodramatic hysteria in all the major crises. Just because the characters in movies and on TV act in a certain way, there's no reason to expect real people to do the same. This is particularly suitable for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for the hiccup scene that will pull the assessments. It is a problem that must be constantly addressed. <br /> <br /> The protagonists interpret the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a large cast that plays all reality-based individuals. Some viewers might be surprised to learn that many of the supporting casts in this story are people better known as comedians in Australia. It reinforces my idea that comic actors do some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; in the sense that I am actually a former Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression than most of the story. I think it's managed with extraordinary creativity and personality and emotional heart. I think the best scene is one in which the couple is haunted by the new choppers. He captured the themes of the story brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for their character as they could." Although this is particularly suited to this story, I think it is also a general principle that should also apply to all actors.
