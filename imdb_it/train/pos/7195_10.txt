I loved this outgoing serial of the republic! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even difficult, the image quality was not the best, but OK. Even the fencing of this serial is a bit ugly, but it's not terrible. They just had to do something more. As I said, the story is GREAT! You're sitting there and you're waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same guy who makes music for Walt Disney's Zorro version, which makes Fightin Legion music. The costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really strong and even the legionaries! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I like that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny, intelligent and brave! Marco: 6.
