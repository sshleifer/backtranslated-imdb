Don't think of this film as another children's movie - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a strange mix of a movie, as it seems to have a movie in it, but at least it makes sense in the end (unlike modern movies!) It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent plot, good characters - well, is the star of the Muppets, a list of minor celebrities * to whom the films would be the object of clamor). What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some moving, others fun and serious, everything makes a pleasant film for families that everyone can see together. <br /> <br /> * The celebrities in the film are actually the best stars of the day, but there is only one real star of the film and nobody will dare to eclipse Miss Piggy !!!!
