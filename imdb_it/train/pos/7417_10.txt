This beautiful story of an older son who returns home and learns to love and be part of all those things he left home to escape is moving and moving. It shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and comic. It has a feeling of realism that no longer seems to be seen in our western movies. <br /> <br /> Acting is unusual, as the film progresses, almost giving the impression that it is not acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. This is a brilliant direction and film making. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more films by this director.
