When musicals weren't showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful films like this. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was happy to finally see this movie. Not really a mixture of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the humorous American vaudeville, the farce joke and witty jokes, clash with Wodehouse's sense of British humor. But overall, American-style jokes make American characters look real rather than cardboard caricatures. <br /> <br /> Some imaginative sets for dance numbers, including the marvelous fair with revolving floors and roof mirrors, rather than the lack of a Busby Berkley on the highest dance number. They seem much more realistic, if you could ever imagine that people start singing and dancing as realistic. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not damage the film, instead it allows the dynamics of different characters to emerge. It is also nice not to have a wise interest in love. Instead we have a delicate love interest, much more in harmony with the young aristocratic women of Wodehouses.
