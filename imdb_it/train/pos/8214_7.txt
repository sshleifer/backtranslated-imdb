"Dirty" inspector Harry Callahan once again irritates his superiors with his non-conformist approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation, he is given a simple case that takes him out of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside the city, which leads him to the trail of an avenger killer. <br /> <br /> As a voice in the Dirty Harry series The film begins with some very promising moments, including the legendary "Go ahead, make my day" line that Eastwood offers wonderfully gritted teeth before flipping through a robbery. Very badass and that's what fans can expect from him. However, the film quickly shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious avenger. The problem is that this killer is not as mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry. This really distracts the presence of the main character who dominated all his previous film appearances with, forgive the pun, Magnum Force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side this new plot does nothing but draw parallels with Harry's unorthodox methods and gives his character a dramatic depth that was not there before, but the fans who were looking for another Harry's attack will be more than completely disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note, so if you don't mind something a little different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for violence and rape scenes
