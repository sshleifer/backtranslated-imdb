Like other people who have commented on "Fr√§ulein Doktor", I stumbled by accident on this little gem on TV late at night without having heard of it before. The strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on one hand and a realistic and well-documented representation of the trench warfare on the other hand made me fall in love from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the five best films about the First World War (the others are "Tutto tranquillo su ovest", "Sentieri di gloria", "Gallipoli" and the postwar "La vie et rien d'autre "). And the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; horses and men appear as horsemen of the apocalypse with their gas masks. I just wish I had recorded the film.
