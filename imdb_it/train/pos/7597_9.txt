Lost holds something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been said a lot, so I won't be writing it again for you. Just read the people who loved it and you will understand why you want to watch it. The nice thing about this series is that it's totally new. There are not many movies - and even fewer series based on the theme of suspense alone, but Lost proudly lives on the theme. It's about the unexplainable and if it is combined with an exotic location, pleasant twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes) you will have a series in which each episode is a story about its own but part of a bigger story. You want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the general image and you want to know where the writers take you. The result is that it is a series that does not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series went a little less in the second season, probably due to its own success. It is known that Lost was written only for a season originally and when overwhelming success followed, even the writers were overwhelmed. In my opinion they made the mistake of adding even more mysteries and in a higher rhythm in the second season, then to solve those (or at least partially) of the season 1. At the end of season 2 ended with a big mistake of secrets , twists and inexplicable phenomena, but there is only such a great spectator. The difference between the second and the third season was nevertheless enormous. The third season distributed a lot of insights, to partially replace them with new questions. And that's exactly how they should write; you want to stumble from one plot to another, don't get a tsunami of secrets spread over you and then take some to explain to the spectators. They got it in the third season and brings us a promising future for the 4 series. It's nice to see that such a different format in a series can be so popular.
