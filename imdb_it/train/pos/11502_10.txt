As a forty-year-old urban explorer / photographer and longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that has not been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration that Carl's character has undertaken during the series. He always managed to get into a big abandonment, sewer or tunnel after another. Armed only with his trusty penlight (okay, so he had some flares in the primordial apes tunnel) and his camera, he never brought any other gear to protect himself or make exploration easier. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently purchased the DVD set of the two pilot films and subsequent TV episodes, and started to slowly review all the shows. And although I remember seeing them in the early 1970s, when they were first broadcast, more than 30 years have passed ... many of them look new again. Campy, dated and cheese - but fascinating and very funny. They don't do things like that these days. Now all the regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter sat down to watch the episodes with me and developed an appreciation for them (she likes the genre). It gives me hope and confidence that the series will continue with new generations of fans for years to come.
