I read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that this is a live mecha anime, and I think they are on the right track. I saw this film for the first time when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally did recently all the memories came back to flood. I don't think this should be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of a good old 80s movie almost-a-TV-movie (it's set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future, even if this point isn't stressed too much ). What I admired most about this film was that the dialogue did not sound generic - no clich√©, no predictable line - all in all simply fun! Maybe the weather wasn't kind to this little movie, but I can still appreciate it in me. It is absolutely not perfect, but it is fun and does not try to be anything other than this. Let the nerds and the comic book guys care about the technical details: who cares? See it yourself and make your decision. Nobody's opinion is important.
