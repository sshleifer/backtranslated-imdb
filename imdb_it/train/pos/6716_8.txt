Late, the great Grade-in-class drive-in filmmaker par excellence Al Adamson truly surpasses himself with this atrocious gloriously soft-core soft-core musical comedy that scars exquisitely shabby and sad with the sheer stupidity of celluloid and stunning stupidity. In the gloomy totalitarian future of 2047, sex was considered an illegal act by the impotent clumsy idiot of Big Brother, the Controller (a funny funny Erwin Fuller). However, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (blonde blonde haired Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. With the help of his effeminate Fairy Godfather (an exuberant camper Jay B. Larson), Cinderella participates in a big gala party with the specific plan to seduce the beautiful stallion Tom Prince (the evil Vaughn Armstrong) and teach everyone to do love is a positive, pleasant and completely acceptable activity. <br /> <br /> Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his usual incompetence of all thumbs, staging the incredibly horrible song and dance sequences with a total lack of skill and talent. The incredibly abysmal number of "We All Need Love" with people in absurd costumes of animals that wander awkwardly through the forest is an exhilarating wonder; ditto the equally abominable "Mechnical Man" routine with a group of awkwardly clumsy robots. The crude and static cinematography of Louis Horvarth, the sticky plastic miniatures, the sparkling soundtrack by Sparky Sugerman, the copious free nudity (the charming brunette brunette Sherri Coyle deserves special praise in this particular department), the terribly childish attempts of a lowbrow humor (Roscoe the executor of the law of the robot is particularly irritating) and the uniformly terrible performances (the outrageously exaggerated portrait of Renee Harmon of Cinderella's overbearing stepmother shoots at the great beauty prize here) further increase the exceptionally abundant generosity to be savored in this deliciously terrible doozy.
