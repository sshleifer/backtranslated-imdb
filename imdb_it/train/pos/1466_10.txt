THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If loving cinema makes me become a pervert, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you are a true "moviefreak" like me then I am sure you never have enough of films about making films and I do not necessarily mean that the dry documentary is known and then. I mean a total discourse on the experience of viewing the film. Well, if that's the case, I did a movie experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph if you were wondering) he noticed the cinephile philosopher Slavoj Zizek giving his analysis on the cinema with something impressive (and often outrageous) assumes everything from the time silent by Chaplin through the modern age of the Wachowski brothers analyzing, probing and pontificating on the psychosexual foundations, on the socio-economic, political and, of course, indefinable magic of the cinematographic experience with its inexorable, determined and almost frantic dissertations. To go from the explanation of how Bates' house in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of Norman Bates in conflict with each level like his Ego, Superego and Id is one thing but then suggest the same thing about every Brother Marx in a blink an eye is a remarkable proof of faith that wins over the skeptical layman. <br /> <br /> Even if I had no idea who Zizek was ?? looks like a hybrid between director Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese ?? with his sibilant tongue and his passion, the guest presents himself as a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek into many of the backgrounds of the movies that are scattered over a humorous tone, but still leaves the ranting and delirium to continue at full throttle giving a pause for discussion in three acts that cover the range of films by artists such as Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and other films such as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> Is there something for everyone and if a man can provoke a discussion or at least a reason to discuss the themes of a movie ?? even if they are Freudians / Jungians for fault ?? so I say that this collection of film theory is worth watching. Look for it now, if you can, before you get to the home video; it's the only way to appreciate it.
