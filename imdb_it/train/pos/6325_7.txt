Not only is this film fun, with excellent comedy, but also politically interesting. It was created at the end of the Soviet Union, but mocks the Soviet mentality to the end. The story is set in the early days of the Soviet Union and questions the logic behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms. Obviously, between the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the bizarre restrictions of Soviet society are already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and well and are ready for a well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this profound philosophical commentary is contained in a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
