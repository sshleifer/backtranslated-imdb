This film doesn't fit some, but it's a must see. I am happy that someone has finally discussed the realities of how African American couples worked to make a name for themselves in the communities and how many of them felt groped to stay there while "other" African Americans moved. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African American male (Danny Glover) who worked his way with the traditionally white positions of the lawyer profession in 1970. As ANY American, he moved his family to be compatible with his upward mobile status, but he forgot, there were still many ongoing problems. The only African Americans in the neighborhood were the maids. One who owns a home? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the merger started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to "get involved", so does what all the other women in his neighborhood do. And just when the man thinks he and his family are "inside", right next door comes another African American who came in because he won the "lotto" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes and doesn't want to have anything to do with them because they don't want the neighborhood to think they are the same. He, of course, is of a better caliber, his new neighbor is "ghetto" and shouldn't be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows you are the great pains it takes for this family to adapt and how they get lost in the process. It makes you wonder where racism begins and where it ends ... and with whom. Show how it does not matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still isolate yourself from the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African American children, when "mingling" in neighborhoods like these fall into the trap of changing to adapt to the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, mind you!) Around them. They laugh along with the jokes, not knowing that they ARE the joke and don't know ... why. <br /> <br /> But overall, this film is about "people". No matter what race you are, this movie becomes terrible to your neighbor and to each other ... all for the sake of adapting ... all because you feel you have more money than others, so that you automatically you're better - and forget the struggles you've had and the ones behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But take a look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
