I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie about Dan, a council columnist, who goes to his parents' house for a stay with his children and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. It is a story that has already been told, but not so. There are simply too many small parts that make the film better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even though Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite as good as the widower who supposedly knows everything but finds that knowing is different from feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. Sometimes witty and wise in the way it can be an annoying example card, the film is still a bit like it can grow on you and be something more than a run on the mill movie. It's worth a look
