I had the pleasure of attending a screening of The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This film caught my attention a little behind when I came across an article about it in Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting at the time, but nothing too exciting. Anyway, I saw it in the festival program and decided to try it. All I can say is that I was speechless when the credits started running. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films I've seen in a long time. Photography, art direction, acting and above all director, were seamless and impeccable. Nothing is "written" for you in this film and actually makes you think. Something that most films do exactly the opposite today. The dialogue is carefully realized and, although this script is not a wall-to-wall chat, the characters' words are very deliberate and significant. <br /> <br /> It is certainly one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see this, the more things are noticed. It is a very stratified and intelligent film. I'm not sure when or where it will play again, but it's a must see for movie fans.
