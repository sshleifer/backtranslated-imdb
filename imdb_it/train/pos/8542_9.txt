_Waterdance_ artfully explores a wide range of aspects of the life of the wounded. From the petty torments of defective fluorescent lights that flash over sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability is open. <br /> <br /> The diversity of central characters underlines the complexity of the material examined - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the black man with a dark past, and Bloss, the racist biker. At first, these men are united by nothing but the nature of their wounds, but they maintain their competitive spirit. Over time, the shared experience, both good and bad, brings them together as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by Joel, who initially distances himself from his patients with sunglasses, headphones and curtains. While he comes to accept the changes that the disability has brought to his life, Joel discards these props and begins to get involved in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the department. <br /> <br /> The dance mentioned in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one's head above water; to abandon the dance is to refuse life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
