I don't watch soaps. My grandmother still looks at the one with the hourglass. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this film takes the parody and writes it in a new way. I found the story pretty damn funny. The fashions of the 80s - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - complete the whole. Huge hair, high heels and histrionics - what a combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors go to the city to chew their parts and spit them into a well-programmed pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi: fantastic! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him again when he had such potential, before the tabloids. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see it in a movie? Leesa Gibbons - she hadn't missed it, but it's nice to include her as a real-life reporter (and where do you apply for THIS job, anyway?) <br /> <br /> Sure, I could have done without Sally who climbed the pipe of discharge. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times, like every Carol Burnett comedian, I don't know who and now I'm done, I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently that's what you do when you're fun in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful that they didn't take out the flagpole. <br /> <br /> But it was nice, it was fun, it had twists, it had a final after it was common, it had clothes worthy of a second look, it had a great cast and has personal memories for me . Really, what else do you need?
