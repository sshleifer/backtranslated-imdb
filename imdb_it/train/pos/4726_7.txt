The origins of this film are a mystery to me, since I only know how much the IMDB did before renting it. I assume that before "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the countless pilots who never did network, cable or anything. The new title of "Kill Shot" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that was never conceived for the cinema. The quick cuts, the "Melrose Place" music and the short 2 second duration of the main actors let you know what you are for. <br /> <br /> And I don't care about everyone. I rented this film seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking that it would be fun to see them in a movie besides the SciFi disguise of Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not a movie so nice - but this is another review). After consulting IMDB, my roommate and I assumed that the pilot was dragged after the apparent career success of Troopers and Richards (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene that involves a minor character to reach the coveted status of R-rated - scope in the suspense video rental sections, ie. In any case, they should have left it unrated if they try to sell it in the suspense / softcore porn section. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's fun. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you he's a television pilot, though. This was the biggest reaction when you looked at it: when you expect a movie and get a TV show, the differences between them become clearer than usual. <br /> <br /> Would I like to rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV program? Well, why not? It's better than Baywatch. And their miserable attempts to hit all demographic data would be back in the mid-1990s. Token black guy (who is gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial appointments), Asian token (Japanese, I assume from the name Koji) more skilled towards science and computers than talking to women, a beautiful and intelligent schoolgirl med Latina has everything for her except her family's bank account - probably this show would work well. <br /> <br /> But as a film it just makes me sick. <br /> <br /> I gave a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. Made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask for rentals.
