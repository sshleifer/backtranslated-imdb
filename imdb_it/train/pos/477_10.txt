Hi everyone, I'm a chess fan since I was about 6 years old. I guess I'm pretty obsessed with chess, but I hope not as much as the protagonist of this movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a nice combination was played from Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply left the tournament room, never to return. <br /> <br /> The social ineptitude of the central character is unfortunately a delight of some of the most serious masters who sometimes happen in chess tournaments. I believe that chess is a great sacrifice and sometimes you can end up being unbalanced in other areas of life. A great example of this is chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although he is a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> The film features a world championship match between an Italian Grand Master and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which in reality the world government body of Fide has sometimes used as the format itself - going from 128 players to only 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also describes a realistic format, in which the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> Pre-upgrade position makes a fascinating chess puzzle in itself. In fact, I made a video on YouTube to let you explore the winning combination in detail - have fun! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
