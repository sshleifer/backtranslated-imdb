I have just seen this movie in preview and all I can say is ... "What did I just see ????" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is the focused, hardworker while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases the poop. The idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be Stiller's best friend makes Stiller go crazy with envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is simply strange. The direction is strange, with a strange rotating opening shot in accelerated sequences out of nowhere. Dialouge and acting are very strange; strange in a wandering way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the film, from the strange song "Envy" that continues to reappear on the scene where you think you hear a classic 80s song, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> <br /> So, the real question is this ... is it weird strange? This depends exclusively on the individual. I was making the iron strangeness of the film fall to the shears. After the screening I heard people call it horribly unattractive and happy that it was free. Strangely, I understood their point. There are no jokes of any sort, so if you're not attracted by the uniqueness of it all, you'd hate this movie. You absolutely hate it. <br /> <br /> This film is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a cult classic of the DVD. If you can laugh at a movie without jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it. If you don't, run away from this movie. It will only make you angry.
