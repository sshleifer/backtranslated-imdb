CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor was higher in the saddle in Western than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This superb story of revenge focused on a Winchester rifle, has only one weak spot I can think of: the casting of Will Geer as a Wyatt Earp much like a fastidious one. The bad guys' casting was good: Stephen McNally, the rude Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile in acting both good guys and bad guys) as a slick gun runner. The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is fantastic! I would put this westerner against the entire crop of westerners produced today. They wouldn't have a chance!
