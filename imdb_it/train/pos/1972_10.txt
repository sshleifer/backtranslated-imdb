I don't understand your objections to this movie. It is a tense and exciting extension of the character created in "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is the least unrealistic is the fact that the character of Sharon Stone is still alive and not in jail on this last date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the film progresses, we are presented with three theories about what is happening: 1) The character of Sharon Stone is killing all these people because she is crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) The corrupt cop of David Thewlis is killing these people to frame the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. What troubles most people on the film seems to be that none of these theories has ever been made explicit as the "real" story. (Even if the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility to kill the policeman, the only murder that occurs on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of "2001, A Space Odyssey". Who cares what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. As in real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over it!
