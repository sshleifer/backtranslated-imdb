That copy of "Death Wish", intriguing and perturbing conocchia, recites the extraordinary supremacy and beauty of Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a first-rate martial arts fighter and a group of wresters who opens a giant ten gallon fierce drum chopsocky whup-a ** on several unscrupulous henchmen, rapists, drug traffickers and street gang members after some evil criminals attacked his beloved grandparents. The sensuous voluptuous Ms. Mani sinks her teeth into her exuberant exultant part with the hard and captivating part of the cock, beating the snappy boys with contagious joy and discovering her boiling body in some absolutely free but very appreciated nude scenes. Unfortunately, Mani has a harsh and croaking voice that is extremely irritating to chew on marbles which is a real murder in the ears (my favorite moment about the dubious delivery of her dialogue happens when she jokes "Don't joke with the girls in the park; nice ! "after tearing some hateful thugs to pieces, the only role of the film after the delightful Karin was in" Avenging Angel ", in which she plays a completely frontal and extravagant nude scene, but without lines.) the most sensuous sequence bleak transpires when Mani is briefly imprisoned with contempt for the court charge and shows his considerably substantial things in a group shower scene. Certainly, the lascivious cellmate of lascivious Mani tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rejected with a severe defeat! Strangely, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes his best friend while he is behind bars. Given an extra galvanizing blow in the vigorously rough arm of the incisive direction of Edward Victor, a funky-rockin score, a play subdued by a game (if lame), a steady and snappy rhythm, numerous pull-out-all-across-stops exciting scenes of struggle, and the gritty photography of Howard Anderson III, this immensely enjoyable experience of exploitation down is an essential vision for the most avid fans of low-budget, low-quality cinema stuff.
