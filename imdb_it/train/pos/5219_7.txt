Gere and Danes are the 2 workers in the public security department who keep track of sexual offenses released. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock. Gere is a too obsessed vigilante about to leave. The newcomer Allison is training to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as a very sick and disturbed puppy. Ask them questions that are not on the list and try to act like the police and solve the crimes. He continues to be warned of this behavior, hence the reason why he is replaced. During his last days of work, a young girl disappears, and Babbage is sure that it is one of his flocks that has been lost. He and Allison draw a list down and discover that some of the criminals have become absent. So, he decides that he needs to track down the missing girl rather than help the police. That part is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There are some sick and twisted things shown in this movie. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a group of sick people disturb each other. Also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, let's see what sick patients are. However, I wouldn't call this film excessive because it doesn't show much about the film. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If you like yellow movies and thrillers and cops chasing assassins, you'll like this.
