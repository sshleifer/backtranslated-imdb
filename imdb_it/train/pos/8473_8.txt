This fascinating and tender and affectionate sequel to "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a sequel in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy and self-sufficient fishing community of a seemingly evil Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty" that resides in the groundless bogs of Boggy Creek. Two humming brothers and their more serious and intelligent sister (a sweet and spirited performance by the future star of the sitcom "Different Strokes" Dana Plato) venture into the treacherous swamp to verify if the creature of the local legend can be true to live. he irretrievably loses himself in a ferocious storm and Sasquatch, a furry, enormous animal, but very kind and benevolent, comes to help the children. <br /> <br /> The casual and no-frills direction by Tom Moore connects this simple story to a quiet pace, cleverly capturing the daily minutiae of the rural city with extremely accurate details, drawing assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and fortunately developing the feeling in an organic, sober, unforced way that never degenerates into sticky meatballs Adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") offers an engaging and amusing portrait of the single working-class mom children, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer a pleasantly irascible support like a pair of quarrels or hurried fools. Robert Bethard's capable and sunny cinematography shows the wooded environment in all its tranquil sumptuousness, painfully pure and fragile, untouched by the splendor of civilization. The Darrell Deck score cleverly mixes the chills of syntax and the banjo's festive jester, splitting the country bluegrass into a melodic sound melody. Furthermore, this image deserves special praise for the way it unmistakably predicts the Big 90 90s Big 90 feature with a good 15-odd years before.
