Seeing this movie was the most fun I've had in a long time. However, I am unable to say if this is a good or bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. This image has everything a movie could ever have. It has the characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action film, a musical and a self-conscious and absurd art film. It's all in there, adding to a myth. <br /> <br /> The basic premise concerns an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), who happily live in Canada, who rush to India to visit her husband's parents after a worrying news program . The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple is in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. At one point, the story borrows "Not without my child", but to call Shakti a remake of something would be an injustice. <br /> <br /> The apparent plot takes precedence over a series of surprising interruptions, including the dream of Shah Rukh Khan of Aishwarya Rai coming out as if it came from another movie. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but appear very late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. Yet he makes up for it with a lively and truly unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor is the one with the most work to do in this film, and does an admirable job, having to connect the film's twists and turns with a show of credible emotions. Another noteworthy presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of her husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene in which she finds herself with a scary but nuanced character. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its part of realism. Violence is rampant, but really disturbing in the abuse received by most female characters, with Karishma being beaten on several occasions. Sometimes this violence is clearly disturbing, but in the end it becomes surreal given that each dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular transformations that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic. <br /> <br /> I've seen a part of Bollywood releases, and the mixture of incredible genres and plot resolutions is certainly their norm. But "Shakti" raises the bar by absorbing an even bigger masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the greatness of a Shakespearean tragedy, where the public of rabble and sovereignty is equally entertained. It's a pure and free cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of having fun by putting every trick in the book. Perhaps the all-important message of violence that generates violence and the inspiring extension of maternal love were not the thoughts in my mind, but I came out of watching euphoric "Shakti". Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
