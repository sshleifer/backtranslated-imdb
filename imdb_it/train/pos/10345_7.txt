The only other review of this film on this date really destroys the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I don't know much about. It is unpleasant when there are not many comments for a certain card, because when there is only one review and the film and the cast are unreasonably wrong, you have no idea what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I don't know where all the poison came from for this movie and the stars. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the material wasn't the best. I found the film and the shows amusing and amusing. It is not one of the great classics of all time, but a pleasant and enjoyable diversion, much more than you can hope for in most recent films. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
