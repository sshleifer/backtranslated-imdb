This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the film was almost like Episode IV - spatial cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret venue, where the seriousness of the gangster Jabba the Hutt was becoming even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in a basement with teeth crushing Bantha's bones, which looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers end up destroying the monster. Adding to the stealthy rescue of Han Solo, which was frozen alive at the end of episode V, Jabba was very angry that Luke had been sentenced to die at the Sarlacc pit outside. <br /> <br /> But all the "good guys" in Star Wars, especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and those other ideas defended Luke's execution; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia was able to use force to kill Jabba. <br /> <br /> As in episode IV, the Death Star in episode VI makes its appearance. While analyzing the rebel fleet that attacked the imperial fighters around the Death Star, I imagined the staff of the Star Horses accelerated the arming of the main laser, using Imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 Star Destroyers that were deployed were ready to attack but were eliminated and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was fired in surprise. Once fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the Death Star's deflector shield would be knocked out, and this hit Lando a lot because he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but he couldn't do it until the shield. And he was eliminated with Lando's growing impatience. <br /> <br /> As in episode V, Imperial Walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin guns, killing at least one of the Ewoks ... but the Ewoks found an ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, as well as another Ewok, was able to confiscate one of the walkers (and actually used it to destroy one of the hikers from behind), and the other Ewoks used the logs to knock out two other walkers. > <br /> It's amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his Light Saber, such as the scene on Endor where Luke deflects the incoming laser shots from a speed trooper speeder bike, and uses the Saber for knock out part of the bike. Or, in a climax, using the Saber to break his father's arm during the last fight with Saber with Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know the Ewok party after the Death Star was burned, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (for example, Storm Trooper Masks), and finally Luke meeting with Leia after Luke's nemesis --- Darth Vader, now dead, is burned on a pyre. Celebrations include singing Ewoks but I think Lucas didn't buy it - even with the strong respect of composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the home movie version, I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the various surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroyed the statue of the Sith. The Ewok song has been replaced by an alternative instrumental song. He probably wanted the extra things to prove that with the destruction of the Death Star, the balance had been restored in the rebel galaxies.
