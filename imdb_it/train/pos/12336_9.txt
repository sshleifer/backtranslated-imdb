An excellent period of murder with melodrama, with Fontaine who actually played against his previous naive wallflower type, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland allegedly rejected. All right, because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, who had written for Hitchcock in the thirties and later also wrote the excellent script for the classic British horror film Night of the Demon. The opening scene, in which Ivy visits a sinuous fortune-telling played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the screecher of the fame of James Whale), is a tour de force, and the film maintains interest in the numerous sinister machinations. I hope to see this film on DVD one day, but the desperation of what is happening, because it seems an undeservedly obscure film. Fortunately, I saw him on AMC about seven or eight years ago, but I haven't seen him since. Take it if you can!
