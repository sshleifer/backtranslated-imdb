Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a good ten, generally in IMDb user rankings. Maybe it's nice not to give credit to the Titanic nowadays, but when it was done it was really something. When the movie came out, people crowded the theaters. When it came out on video, my sister and I watched it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forget, like the frozen child, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey this to the film with the immediacy and emotion he needed is a tough challenge that James Cameron came forward with. And let's not forget the fantastic love story between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination, it was beautiful. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They are certainly giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic is an exceptional film for its core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent photography, wonderful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really sucks when someone says they hate this movie.
