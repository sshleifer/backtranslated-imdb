Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all words that crossed my mind as I watched this beautiful and simple film. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a film to actually move me, but "Shall We Dance?" accomplished that with the grace to save. The gentle humor mixed with occasional subtle agony has made this one of the best experiences of my movie viewing story. It left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a little touch of sadness mixed in. <br /> <br /> And the dance, oh yes, the dance. Even if you are not an art lover or you cannot put one foot in front of another, the steps shown here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as quickly as possible. It was absolutely enchanting, even the parts showing Sugiyama's rigged footsteps (touched by Koji Yakusho) when he was learning to dance were adorable in a fun and childish way. Yet this film was not entirely devoted to dance, but rather to the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor who rediscovers his love for the art and personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Ache. Emotion. All the love and the little agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate sensation of a refined Japanese watercolor combined with the emotional strength and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
