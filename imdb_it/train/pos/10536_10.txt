Yes ... I go with the 1-0 on this and here's why. In the last few years I have seen quite a few comedies and I came out with only a few laughs and a couple of videos for the delay in the fee because the films were easy to forget. Then I stumble on "Nothing". It seemed interesting, I didn't expect much though. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the chance to see. Dave and Andrew are an exceptional couple and the humor was quite engaging to remember, but not too complex to the point of losing the joke. I don't want to comment on any of the real scenes, because I think this is a movie worth seeing for once. With more and more useless concepts coming into the movies (you know, like military jet killers and "fresh" remakes that are ruining old classics), this movie will make you happy to say it's OK to laugh at "Nothing".
