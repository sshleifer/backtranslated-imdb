This was the best film I've ever seen on Bulimia. It is striking the exact point of what Bulimia really is and how it is not always about being thin and diets. He showed how people with Bulimia tend to think of things like their outlook on life, friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is is when Beth says "It's not about you!" That line showed a lot about the character and the others with the same problem. He showed that people with Bulimia don't have this problem because of everything that has to do with someone else. It has to do only with them and them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem instead of focusing on himself. He showed that Beth needed to call attention at that moment and needed his mother's attention at that time.
