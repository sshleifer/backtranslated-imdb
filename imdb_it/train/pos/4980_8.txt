While browsing the internet for previous sales prices, I found these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been delighted. I showed it to many of my friends and they liked everything too. I feel privileged to own this original 1932 Shirley black and white silent film before it became popular or well known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the film is "lively". Big deal! I just wish it were longer. Looks like I should be the only person who owns one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder how much is it?
