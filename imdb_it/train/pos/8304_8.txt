I took this movie late on a Saturday / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best tear-off movies I've ever seen. From the "luxury" transatlantic it is actually a "roll on, roll off" ferry, complete with cast iron all around the doors with stickers that say personal, then see the same door used for something else in another scene this movie makes you tremble !! The continuity is so scarce that you can't help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with holes. In the final scene he jumps off a lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and his new girlfriend (the director of the PR ships who knows the kung-fu and used to be at the police but was fired for doing things his way - true) on the ferry going very fast away explosion. ...... Then the father is there embracing them. Such as???? Who cares, its magic. There is no saving feature in this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with a game table. when he is chased by the bad there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the bad guys who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to fire on four fruit machines and a small corner bar (a corner of the casino - fantastic). They walk straight past the only hiding place, thus allowing our Casper to get around them and "take them out". <br /> <br /> Bring some companions, have a drink, put this film on and howl.
