The Sunshine Boys is a formidable comedy about two ex-Vaudevillians who reluctantly gather for a television special despite the fact that they despise each other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo fights for the smallest little things! The material is fast and witty, attractive for all ages. <br /> <br /> NOTICE OF MILD'S SPOILER: There are some slightly sad moments towards the end of the film that indirectly deal with the effects of aging that give the film a sweet, sincere, tenderness that shows this reviewer that what the couple really needs more for success, they are each other. <br /> <br /> If someone loves The Odd Couple, you will love this movie. An excellent film!
