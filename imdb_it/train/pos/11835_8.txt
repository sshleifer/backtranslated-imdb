While I wanted to see this movie from the first time I watched the trailer, I was surprised by this movie. While some of the characters' elements and actions seemed a bit too "cartoonistic", the film's dark nature really makes this experience very different. Instead of the story of happiness, this film takes you in another direction that turns out to be uplifting, but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some of the film's darkest moments, which makes this movie quite watchable for adults. I was also struck by cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a network without interruptions of pots and inclinations. The musical score was once again solid, demonstrating that Hans Zimmer is the ideal guy when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I'd say that I really liked the music of Brian Adams.
