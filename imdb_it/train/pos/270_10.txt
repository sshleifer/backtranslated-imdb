I must say that Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The perception I took from the previews was that it would be a bit monotonous but I was pleasantly surprised by this awesome mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists on her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), doesn't attend a so-called graduation party a week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and leaves for the party anyway. When Lori doesn't come home, Emilie knows something is wrong and she starts having visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen and missing is better than many other TV movies of this type, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason for seeing this film, and most of it is credible. This original LMN film was presented for the first time last night. 10/10
