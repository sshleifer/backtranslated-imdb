... Oxford, Mississippi, at least. Ok, the Paris we get is Paris, Culver City, apart from the repertoire of the Establishing library of the real McCoy, but it is Paris in the spirit of which nothing, anywhere, is better. Okay, Kelly is not Astaire, but who is Caron is not Hepburn, ditto, but Alan Lerner is light years ahead of Comden and Green, who greatly overestimate the script of Kelly Singin's other great '50s musical In The Rain ( a curious replica of lyricists who write screenplays with songs from OTHER lyricists and just to balance things, Gershwin's numbers are far superior to the numbers of Arthur Freed / Nacio Herb Brown, so Alan Lerner shouldn't have felt too outclassed). History must not hold us back from the anomalies: Kelly did not change the match and is a painter, that is bohemian, yet he is able to scare a perfectly good suit with a few hours notice when Foch invites him to dine at his hotel; in the well-documented sequence of Love Is Here To Stay the lovers are strangely undisturbed by passers-by, other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally devoid of pedestrian and vehicular traffic - this is, after all, a good musical feeling, so it stands or falls from score and in this case there are four squares. Like feeling good, musicals are certainly among the top 10.
