There is so much to love in this dear little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or been short on space, will find that there is much more than a grain of truth in the sad condition of the subdued Mr. Blanding. Melvin Douglas, with a great comic laugh, both narrate and act as Blandings' attorney and the voice of reason. As well, Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather desperate but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grant's. It is the ordinary American, particularly relevant at the time of the publication of this film, when the nation was prey to a housing shortage after the end of the war. The themes are universal, lack of money, tension in work, fear of infidelity. Yes, it wraps itself up terribly, but keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. It is still relevant today, and I have to cast the few reviews that I see for a current preference for stunned, coarse comedies. The film's appearance is fluid, and there are some great comedy pieces, especially in the beginning. Although it may have lost some of its social significance, almost sixty years after its release, it is still a gem.
