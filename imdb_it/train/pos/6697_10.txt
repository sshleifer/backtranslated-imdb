I remember seeing Sabrina for the first time when she came to UK TV on ITV1 when I was 13/14. Now I'm 24 and I still love him as much as I did when I first looked at him. I take a small stick from some of my friends for having still witnessed a "children's show", but I don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan has also become another of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honoring Sabrina on the Nickeleoden UK TV station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was very good in "Clarrissa Explains All" but much better in this. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope it will be released on DVD here in the UK soon - I'll be the first in line! lol x
