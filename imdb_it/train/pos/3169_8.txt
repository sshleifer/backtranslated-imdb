I rented it a few years ago, the video store only had VHS at that time. Straight to the video was hitting his steps (you know, where the covers use the same font and the same color combinations as the successful movies). I didn't know what to expect except what was printed. The first thing I thought while watching was "what the hell did they do wrong with the sound?" - Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. The words echoed, so I stopped crunching what I had to do to attract attention - mind you that there is no Shakespeare here, just simple speeches. The story is quite simple, the boy meets the girl etc. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was, the people in the film didn't look like caricatures written in history, but rather not actors ripped out of their real jobs (uniforms included). All the while, you begin to perceive what the director is looking for, then you see that there are no attempts at economic humor (people who hurt their private individuals, using vulgarity could not harm marketing. If they had a more budget great then it would have been better, I'm sure they considered every day, but they went ahead and arrived. This, I heard, was what the independent film is. "Indy", it's thrown around like it's a genre ... Ha! .. it's fun!
