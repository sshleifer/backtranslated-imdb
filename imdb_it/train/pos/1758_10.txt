I was really surprised by this movie. Entering the preview, not knowing anything about the film, except for the trailer I had seen, I thought it would be a Dude Where's My Car, a kind of shitty party. I was expecting jokes and farts of bad sex, and a pathetic character who ends up fucking because that's how movies work. Instead, I got a clever and surprisingly original film about a normal and discreet guy who never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is chock full of sexual jokes and vulgarity and occasionally hey-look-a-apple !, but it is done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than in Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook up a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I went thinking that this movie would be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's pretty exaggerated (come on, it's a film about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very well done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to fuck, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did it really matter to you if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
