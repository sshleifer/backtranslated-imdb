They probably would have jumped a little at first - I'm not sure why this starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it were because starting from the Mediterranean, they could have come closer to today's Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of the cameras and crews arrive at the Bakhtyari tribe, it's the beginning of an incredible 48-day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this incredible trek through what appears to be a fast-moving Karun river. They use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs were removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I guess for a 60 degree increase. <br /> <br /> Just watching it was incredible, but there was much more to do. To reach the pastures, they also had to cross a large mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was quite surprising in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of this documentary are some of the inter-titles with few attempts at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the era of silence or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only faces but conquers. This is just an incredible document from a little-known group of people who face all kinds of challenges.
