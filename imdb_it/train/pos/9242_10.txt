It is difficult to evaluate films like this, why do you consider it in production or just fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in about 1988/89 when I was a boy and I'm sorry. Let's say he started a long life of fascination with the ninja. The plot is pretty terrible and the acting is obviously terrible, but there is a certain mystery surrounding the ninja in this film that creates a rather pleasant atmosphere. What is important is the fighting scenes, while a haggard little one is really good. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it was better when I was a boy, only now can I see the dazzling points of incredible nonsense in the film, but like a martial arts film "sit down with a couple of beers" I can't fault it, offers and is much better than the "American Ninja" style garbage mountains that were churned out in the 80s with hundreds of boys in black suits but really unattractive combat scenes. <br /> <br /> On an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers made another ninja film under the banner of the Bonaire movie called "White Phantom" I have no idea if this was to be a sequel of Sakura Killers "but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time including a White Ninja. It had a small sense of atmosphere but the fighting scenes are even more scarce and to be honest, they are pretty horrible. <br /> <br /> So, if you are a martial arts fan, blow it up for a few hours!
