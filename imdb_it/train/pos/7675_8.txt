After watching the film last night, I was left with the feeling of despair that organizations are trying to tackle to address the problem that the film portrays. The extent of prostitution seems so great that it is difficult to see how it can be defeated without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the review. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a gloomy film with an uncomfortable central relationship, this is a very compelling film, and I would go so far as to say it was fun. The film was well cared for the running time and Thuy Nguyen's performance was excellent. I also heard that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to have a little more insight into why Patrick feels he has to help Holly, but maybe the reason is as simple as he explains to Chris Penn's character. I won't explain it here - go see the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good and inspiring film, obviously with good intentions. I hope you will get a release large enough to reach a decent size audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
