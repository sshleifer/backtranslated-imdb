I came to this show late - I think it was the third final episode, when I saw it for the first time - and it was wiped out by a social comment that was not seen on American TV by "All in the Family". <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that CBS would also have performed this in the first place. <br /> <br /> Which is to say that the last time CBS had a set - if you understand what I mean - the day of 'All in the Family' was back. The most controversial decision I am prepared to make today is the amount of eye makeup to wear on Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people really crazy, let them find out about themselves. And if you want them to be willing to pull ropes, make calls and remove a work of art, let them discover that truth by listening to their own words spoken by their mouth. <br /> <br /> Aardman people have always been long before the curve. And this show is no different. Somehow he slipped under the CBS "corporate / social / political / censor radar" to update it (perhaps the "big brass" never looked at it until it finally went on the air?), But once that a good "ol middle" merika has felt and seen oneself being oneself - well, you can bet the farm that the message, or the messenger, won't last long. <br /> <br /> Now, if only the "missing episodes" can find their way on Usenet or bit-torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
