The fourteen-year-old in me is immensely happy to be now able to make good-looking fantasy movies, which are all the rage, with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making a lot of cash at the box office. This year he will see (and has already seen) many others, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I have not seen previews for this, just a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is a kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it except for the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting has been opened this weekend. Well, if you forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been properly aligned, because I went to see Stardust and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like The Lord of the Rings. The plot is your basic quest (the hero sets out in search of a shooting star) full of obstacles. But within this basic scheme, the story is lively and imaginative. It simply wants to be a lot of fun and a charming little love story. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were many important films this summer, but none of them was as fun as this. There is much to do, but the story is told well and is almost entirely consistent. It's not a masterpiece, but it certainly can occupy the same kind of terrain that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't quite like it like the previous movie). A lot of fun to have here if you are a fan of the genre.
