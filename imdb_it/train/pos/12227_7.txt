I looked for this after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging "Clueless" (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best known effort since the beginning of his film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should help improve most film projects. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only disappointment that I think the film has for me is an embarrassing "feel" for some scenes, deriving from the need to perform a rather intransigent and raised theme as part of what in tone starts as a schoolgirl adventure. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good at this. He plays well the naive enthusiasm and the growing unease that strikes Mary Giordano while maneuvering towards the truth behind serial murders. I think his characterization of MG also has a certain yield in terms of mileage. The inference of the plot is that she pursues a career in law enforcement. It might be really interesting for an old Silverstone to revisit Giordano in a moment of crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has the merit of writing. I don't know of any other cinematographic work that the PV has done. I can only ask myself what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown support cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is not really that. In the last decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances. I remember seeing him recently in "Carriers" (1998), a film made for a television presentation with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic television series "Who's the Boss" could also be interested in "Carriers" because the main character is Judith Light, fondly remembered by many for his long involvement with the show. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" could easily not have worked, but that's fine. I think it's a fun story to see.
