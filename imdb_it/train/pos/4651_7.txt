I did not set very high expectations for this film, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit strange sometimes, but overall I think it has acceptable credibility. The action scenes are quite beautiful and the accompanying music is used to induce some patriotic feelings common to American films. This may not be the best film ever but it's not common for Sweden and I hope to see more similar ones in the future.
