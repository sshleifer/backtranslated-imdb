Congratulations to Cesar Montano for relaunching the Cebuano film! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - it has drama, action, romance and a scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Even if the story is not so original (a love triangle - or a four-pronged love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as a lord), his presentation is something interesting, especially if he uses the original language: bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for Japanese and English for the American. <br /> <br /> This film will be one of the best Pinoy films this year. <br /> <br /> Go see this!
