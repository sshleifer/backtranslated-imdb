This is a nice drama and a nice change of pace compared to the most hectic and noisy movies of today. This is another solid store based on a real store, which still means that much of it could be invented for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man in the fifties who is interested in missiles and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines like everyone else, including his father, in this city of the West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was exaggerated. I'd like to have a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first permanent assignments, I think. He is nice, as are his schoolmates here. It's nice to see good guys in a modern movie. The other two key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (the father) and Laura Dern (the child's teacher who encourages him all the time). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is decent, the 1950s soundtrack is fun to listen to. Once again: I wish there was more of this type of film made today.
