Origins of the Care Bears and their cousins. If you have seen the original film you will notice a discrepancy. Cousins ​​grew up with Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However, I have no problems with this, preferring to treat films as separate interpretations. Kids are adorable and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a deliciously threatening shapeshifter. I could empathize with the three children because I have never been good at sports. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love toys or you liked the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10
