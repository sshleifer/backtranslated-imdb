A Matter of Life and Death, what can we really say that would do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger knows no bounds, every frame is full of imaginative compositions. The switches between the bold colors of the "real world" and the black and white of the sky are brilliant, visually showing us how much life is more lively. Even the final court scene is fantastic, as the judge and the jury descend the stairs to the sky to hold court on Peter's operation (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All the performances are exact (Roger Livesey is a champion), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, there has never been a more romantic movie than this (if there is a paradise ? I saw it). A Matter of Life and Death covers all the power of love and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the movie alone, the way it illuminates Kim Hunter's face makes it even more beautiful, that genius can make something as simple as a ping-pong game exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound was muted at the vital points was a decision ahead of its time <br /> <br /> This is a true classic that can restore the confidence of anyone in the cinema, under appreciated in its initial and public of today, but one of my all-time favorites, that's why I give this film a 10/10, in a word: Beautiful.
