I found this film fascinating. I thought the characters had been developed since, while I was watching, I found myself taking care of these people. This is a period piece that I believe took place during the depression. A single mother, who is known as the recluse city (she has reason to be), puts an advertisement in the newspaper for "a husband". Christopher Reeve plays a former prisoner who comes to the city in search of work. He sees the announcement and he leaves to see it. She hires him. I really had a few laughs as their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes. Everything went on like this. He needs work, so he doesn't want to upset her. And she needs his help, but she doesn't want him to get the upper hand. They dance around the fact that they really start feeling each other. Things start to warm up until ...... the big bang. I don't want to ruin it by telling you what happens. But the resolution point is perfectly wonderful. I found the story very credible by the time it is unfolding. I think this is one of the best "relationship" stories out there. Perhaps the younger generation will not "understand" but if you are over 40 I think you will like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time" you will like it too.
