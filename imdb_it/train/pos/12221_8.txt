This is a nice piece of work. Plot sexy enough and engaging to keep my interest alive. Its main disadvantage is that it seems made for TV: full screen, and although there were different sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy approached!). Strange, also because Netflix shows that it was classified R. <br /> <br/> Nevertheless, very titillating, and I would like Alicia Silverstone to make more films like this. <br /> <br /> A Netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series, but I wasn't able to find out which series it is. I'd like to find out, though, why this movie was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 08/23/2005
