This pleasant little noir boasts a high level cast and many memorable scenes. The great distraction is the total disregard for authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to top it all off, Bacall should be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good, especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene where Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and talk in very different accents is a real blast! And I imagine, since they were alone, that they really should have spoken in Spanish anyway! It seems strange that Brothers Warner could not find Spanish actors in Los Angeles! Obviously Hollywood has often had a policy "any old accent will do" - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have taken Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - it would have been great in the role of Boyer or at least that of Francen (which would have saved a lot on the budget for dark make-up).
