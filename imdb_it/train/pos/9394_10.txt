"Red Rock West" was by far one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90s with a superb script (by John and Rick Dahl) that made you guess anywhere and on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a wonderful cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and in particular J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this thrilling and compelling thriller not to be missed. The film has never had much publicity (in fact I saw it for the first time on TV) and is therefore one of those little special gems you have to look for but this unique film is slowly gaining a cult following. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and out of work when he is in the small town of Red Rock. Exchanged for a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas, he is shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to kill the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the piano and decides to go and warn Brown Suzanne's wife (Lara Flynn Boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double reports - that Cage is thrown into a crisis to the other and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation from which he cannot pull himself out! So to further complicate matters, the real Lyle shows up to perform the contract murder (played by Dennis Hopper, everyone's favorite, heavy). When Hopper finds out what happened, he goes after Cage, but no one could foresee the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite lines of the film: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman hurt herself but it's a lot of money". <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams, well, Michael, you'll spend some time with us until we get to the end of it". <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "Aren't you a murderer?" Cage: "It's true, no, but the boy I should be has just entered the city, so you have to get out of here." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "OK, how are you going to explain impersonating a killer and take $ 10,000 from my husband?" <br /> <br /> An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a plot that never gives up and a powerful acting by all the principals. Any film with J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad that this exceptional acting career was tragically cut by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for "film noir" was undoubtedly that of the 1940s but "Red Rock West" is a good example modern of the genre and has entered my "Top Ten" list of all the favorite movies of all time. I look forward to more than director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
