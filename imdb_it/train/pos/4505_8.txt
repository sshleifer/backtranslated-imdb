Eskimo is a serious film on the cultural abyss between an indigenous population and the intrusive white man. Although filmed in a documentary style with non-professionals, Eskimo is a qualified production that contains a credible story that the public will want to see until the last shot. <br /> <br /> The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than the whalers who obscure its landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his partner, it is natural that other men share their women with their friends. It is also normal for their women to want to take the place of their missing spouse. All this seems natural in the context of the desolate Arctic sectoral omen. The confident Eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy European accents) who do not regard these natives as their peers. Deception, drunken orgies, rape and death occur after the Eskimo men leave for work on the cold cold seas. Eventually the leader Eskimo (Mala) realizes he was deceived and takes his revenge. The public would have applauded in the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of bringing Mala back to trial. The Mounties are interpreted as feeling like policemen who know that this is not a dry case. Will the Mounties conquer their man? Is it right to keep Mala in a code of conduct outside of her traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law should prevail? Is there no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great film, but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the problem faced in a very different context. I suspect that the shooting of sequences with animals was done before today's announcement that no one was injured in the making of the film - so watch out for sequences of a raw nature. Highly recommended.
