How to lose friends and alienated people came out in 2008. Bombed at US post offices. It's an absolutely fun movie with an exceptional cast. Simon Pegg is wonderful to play Sidney Young, who wrote the book "How to lose friends and alien people, I know it's not a true story. The only way I know it is because Sidney wants to go out with an actress named Sophie Maes "Maes doesn't exist, but apart from that, the film could be real. How to lose friends and Alienate is probably the funniest movie of 2008, and I think you should definitely see it. As I said before, the film has a fantastic cast included: Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man, The Virgin Suicides) Danny Huston (The Number 23, 30 days at night) Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) Megan Fox (Transformers, Confessions of a teenage drama Queen) Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing) In general, How to lose friends and Alienate is fun, I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work well together, and I think you should see it, even if there are some strange nudity including Transsexuals, it's a hilarious and fantastic comedy, one of the best of Si mon Pegg. <br /> <br /> The Story: Sidney Young, a British journalist, travels to New York to work on Sharp magazines. While there, he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before her boss does.
