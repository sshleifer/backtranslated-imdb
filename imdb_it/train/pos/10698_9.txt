A little funny movie. It's absolutely incredible, unbelievable, impossible. But it's funny how an introverted masochist can become totally addicted and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl he barely knows but who managed to descend into his ghosts. Obviously it is a complaint of the silly offers you can get on the Internet. You don't have to believe the ten percent of what you're told and never ever agree to tie your hands in one way or another to someone or something or an organization that you don't know personally. Most of their "businesses" are there in one way or another that deceive you and make you raid. But here the guy deserves to be a victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the film becomes fun because it ends with the victim of the dishonest business who has the upper hand and ends up playing the same game with his executioner and winning. Think of this too. Safety at UK airports is not exactly what it should be, but I imagine it is no better anywhere else in the world and even now they have enforced all the rules and regulations it is fun to go through their procedures and systematically foil them. Then they have their revenge by losing their luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and they don't expect to get fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or a can opener because it could be dangerous. I can see myself as I make my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, isn't it?
