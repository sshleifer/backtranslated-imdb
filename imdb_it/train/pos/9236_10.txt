Let's think about people, let's stop talking bad about the original, because it's time that the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece, even with all the stars, textures and art. Lorne Greene was great as Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect because Apollo and Dirk Benedict were as fun as Starbuck, but I dare say he wasn't as good as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was beautiful John Calicos was great as Baltar, War of the Gods, the best was Experiment on Earth, I thought it was a tribute in one way Paradise can wait, then you had the women of Battlestar, not to compare them to Tricia who is extraordinarily beautiful as number six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour cannot be compared to. Not to mention Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic. He had the beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed about. I loved the original as much as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
