*** SPOILERS *** One of the first films of the Second World War to come out of Hollywood that shows how the war hit those American soldiers, or in this case the American marines, who fought inside it. <br /> <br /> 21 years At Schmid, John Garfield, he was just starting to live with a well-paid job - earning around $ 40.00 a week - at the local steel mill and the girl Ruth Hartley, Elenore Parker, who he was about to marry when the Japs ruined everything for him, and millions of young Americans alike, attacking the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. Doing his duty as an American citizen, Al immediately joined the United States Marine Corps, hoping to return to the Japs knowing, correctly as it was to come out, that the Marines would be the first American combat units to get a crash against them. /> <br /> Al finally had his chance when his unit, the 1st Marine Division, landed on August 7, 1942 in Guadalcanal, in the distant Solomon Islands to engage the Japanese who were in control. It was during the battle of the Ilu River that Al, with one hand, stopped a massive Japanese Banzai attack, with its machine gun, waves of suicide attacks by the resolute Japs until help or reinforcements arrived. It was during the bloody fight that Al was hit in the face by a Jap grenade that ended up blinding him. <br /> <br /> Now back in the United States recovering in a naval hospital Al is faced with something much more difficult to overcome then fighting a battalion-sized attack by Japanese or German soldiers. He faces a future in which he will never see again and will have to depend on others to look after him or for him! <br /> <br /> We will see in the movie "Pride of the Marines" At the battle himself much more difficult than he did the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal in only coming to terms with his disability. Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to feel sorry for him, Al is the one who feels sorry for himself more than anyone else in the movie. It is with the help of Navy Nurse Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp, and Ruth together with her American marine friend Lee Diamond, Dane Clark, who eventually gives Al the courage to face his blindness with the same strength that he faced after waves waves of Japanese troops on Gudalcanal. A courage that Al thought he had lost in that hell on the island forgotten by God in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> Based on the true story of US naval sergeant Albert Schmid "Pride of the Marines" showed what we expected from the tens of thousands of wounded American soldiers returning from the war. We will see how in many ways it was much more difficult for those who fought the war to adapt to an America in peacetime when they left something, as in the case of Al Schmid, on the battlefield. Al's battle with his personal demons was much more difficult than the Japanese who fought because they were part of him and therefore had to fight himself to defeat them and defeat them. Despite the help received from both Nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth, and from his Navy doctor, who has a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck, it was still Al's job to overcome the fears he faced. Fears that he and he alone had to fight and overcome, as he had been told by everyone in the film, all by himself.
