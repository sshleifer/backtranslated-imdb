Normally I'm not obliged to write a review for a film, but the only comment for this film so far is rather unfair, so I think it's necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as it was entitled to the theater I saw it, "Fallen") follows Matiss, a lonely Latvian archivist, as he tries to meet a woman who has not tried to stop from jumping from a bridge, as well as his reasons for doing so. This is the plot in a nutshell, but this film does not deal with history as much as it is in painting the guilt of a man who has not acted. As a detective who investigates the incident tells him, we usually don't worry about worrying about the anonymous faces we spend every day until they die. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" will most likely abound in any review you read about "Krisana". The influence of the philosophical and austere style of Antonioni and the story of "Blowup" are clear and, in fact, the writer / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss tries to get to know the woman who jumps from the bridge, or at least those who think they are doing. <br /> <br /> The only other person to share his views on the film takes away the look and sound of the film from the "university film class". He or she neglects to consider the budget constraints that an existentialist Latvian film probably faces, but atmospheric black and white cinematography and the ambient sound can represent the solitude of Matiss on an artistic level. The background noise of the wind and street noise gives an eerie aura and is reminiscent of a Fellini film, regardless of Kelemen's intention. The directors undoubtedly have little money, but this constraint is used for the advantage of the film. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown to prevent him from being too serious. He could easily have fallen into the traps of a mysterious story, but avoids it and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more interested in the plot, this movie and its ending could frustrate you. If not, take the time to do it. It is worth looking for.
