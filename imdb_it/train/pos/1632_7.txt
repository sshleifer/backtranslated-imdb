Dissatisfied in a military school? Hmmmm, it sounds fun, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the crazy teenage sex, the intelligent mouth, the pipe smoker, and don't forget, the guy who burns things. Throw a stern and nonsensical Sergent, a homosexual Sergent and a sexy ammunition teacher and take a crazy adventure. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie and it's fun, because the comedy revolves around the fact that if you try to work together, things are done. <br /> <br /> This band of maladjusted students at the Weinberg military school was included here because, as Sergeant Liceman states "because you are outcasts, embarrassment to your families and communities, misfortunes". One of the first performances of Ralph Macchio before Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with appearances also by Barbara Bach, this film appeals to children and young adults. <br /> <br /> The fantastic soundtrack keeps the film in motion.
