You would be forgiven for thinking that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing an American horror film (especially one entirely locked up in a US prison) - see this to prove you're wrong! After all it was produced in the 1980s and the film was made on a budget more suited to a modern do-it-yourself corporate TV ad (something I think anyone would really notice these days with practically all the $ 100m + budget for movies). action that unfortunately dominates the industrial mind market!) being the first major production of Mr. Harlin and - at least that which today would be considered a stellar cast. I still think that most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole depends more on Stellan Stargaard's screen appearances (not to mention Bergman's well-overvalued directorial efforts) - at least for all female viewers - but this movie really shows that there is an appropriate cinematographic talent outside the United States and Hollywood to make us watch an outstanding film. Try watching this movie even if you're not a horror guy, IMO is definitely worth it!
