I was so surprised when I saw this underrated movie ... I understand why some of you don't like this movie. His rhythm is slow, a feature of Japanese films. However, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will not find this problem at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Shall We Dansu?" it is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from those in Hollywood, eg Austin Powers or Scary Movies, where a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it is carefree, a film that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the film because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple but pleasant. I was very pleased to see that Sugiyama (the main role) found the meaning of life in dance. Before watching the film I was a little depressed because of the schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the positive side of life. I thought I was in the same boat as Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of "exploring my future" and discovering happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the perfect dancing scenes as expected, I like how it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance while the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> Above all, this film is encouraging and exciting. Like a comedy, he does his job perfectly. Definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes Aoki is fun: -D
