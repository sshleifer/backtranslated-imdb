Note that all those who did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book. <br /> <br /> I don't understand this kind of criticism. Books and films are different media. While the books have hours and hours to develop characters and textures, the films have about 120 minutes. Yet the film has the advantage of stimulating different senses: visual, audio and imagination. I don't care if a movie is good or, in fact, it has any resemblance to the book it is based on. Who cares? I judge him for what he is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was fascinating. An old and often seen story, prone to clich√©s, could easily have been embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves knock it off. A reviewer found Riffen very far. I never imagined he was 40 when he shot this movie. She is to her credit as an actress who has played an incredibly well 23-24 years. I also think it's the best thing Reeves has ever done. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the screen could have used "tighten". However, it is worth looking at; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather a fascinating novel that will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the mandatory word $ #%, bare buttocks, or hours of kissing spitting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score is excellent.
