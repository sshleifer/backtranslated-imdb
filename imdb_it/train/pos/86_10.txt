I remember seeing him in a cinema in Salem (where I used to go to "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a kid and I never forgot it. He simply amazed me and my friends. I wish there was a way I could see it again! I tried to find some short film compilations or something like that to no avail. Only recently did I find out that it was a Cousteau film and it shocked me even more. How on earth has realized this is beyond my comprehension. The fish is REALLY IN THE MOUTH OF THE CAT at one point, if I remember correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see it again, I would be extremely grateful!
