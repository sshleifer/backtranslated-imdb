Paul Reiser did a spectacular job writing this film. Peter Falk gives the execution of his life. It is worthy of an Oscar. This was one of the most touching and entertaining films of the year. Reiser's intelligence is fantastic and he is as good as he is and as he was on his long TV sitcom "Mad about You". Peter Falk did a masterful job as his father, and Peter, who is now 78, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was up to the task, especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must-see film for 2005. We bet that everyone, of all ages and religions, will adore this film and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and brothers like these in the movie. We all had good times and bad moments together and I wish things were the same but different.
