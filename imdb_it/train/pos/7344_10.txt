In my opinion, this is a good example of the film that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier. I doubt it would benefit from modern technologies, but it would have seemed much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this film can boast the best background art and one of the best character designs. The animations are extremely fluid and realistic. For the duration of the film you believe in the world you see, so everyone has done a great job. He can also boast one of the sexiest, if not the sexiest, female animated characters that easily teases typical anime girls. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad moments on this film that won't make it so appealing at the moment. First, the plot and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and it's really old style by modern standards. Secondly, due to the length of time, he would benefit greatly from the extra 20 minutes of dialogue. Finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a great alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not a novel.
