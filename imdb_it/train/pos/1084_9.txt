Reflections: pure delight from beginning to end. Not a laugh of laughter, but a more subtle and sophisticated humor. What a gold mine of great scenes and actors of characters, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr .. Gary Grant is in the palace of his new home, which is at that point, to be framed . A young carpenter, played by the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "knights" to be beaten, or something like that only a carpenter could know. Grant, not wanting to seem ignorant, answers in the affirmative. At that point, Barker shouts to his companions, "OK guys, he wants them teased, so ... YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you will hear the torn and tearing sounds of about 20 large nails that are extracted from various boards. All that Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is dated. You would never see so many carpenters working at the same time in a single-family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, will probably have a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic film that is truly a treasure.
