This film begins with a family going in different directions and the teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne) who suddenly enters the scene with her daughter and Zack coming out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface. Jill Dunne has a husband who always travels or often leaves home. There are also major problems that occur when the family decides to go camping, to which their daughter Olivia does not like and cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to keep out all the insects. In many ways, Olivia makes an exceptional performance as the teenager and Nick Mancuso, (Richard Grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner. This film will show you how it will end and you will enjoy a film full of horror and terror. To enjoy
