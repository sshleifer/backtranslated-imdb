Okay, I'll admit it - I'm a rubber ball and from time to time I love a very silly comedy. While I have seen more films by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a weakness for a drugged comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply fun. Some films of the genre that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME STARTS, STRANA BREW and the films of Bill and Ted. All lacking in snobbish charm but only a zombie or a professional film critic might not like them. <br /> <br /> While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original film by Bill and Ted, it is still a lot of fun. Furthermore, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember not having loved the movie the first time I saw it, perhaps because the other film had such a high standard for laughter. But, every time I see him again, I'm amazed at all the great moments - especially those involving the Grim Reaper. And by the way, this reaper is different from that of Bergman in THE SEVENTH SEAL as can be achieved !! In addition to a lot of laughs, this film has excellent music - a way in which it is actually better than the first film. The hymn of Kiss in the end is great, as is the rest of the hard rock songs, provided you are not an old killjoy like De Nomolos. Excellent vision for children and adults.
