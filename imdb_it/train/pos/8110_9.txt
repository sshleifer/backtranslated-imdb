Amazing effects for a film of this period. A primer of the uselessness of war and of how war becomes a nourishment for itself. <br /> <br /> A wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now in the public domain and available on archive.org. No charge, no registration required. Watch it at once and you will be pushed. <br /> <br /> I'm going to share this movie with as many people as possible that I've never heard before and I'm a science fiction fan. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see how others react to this film. <br /> <br /> Watch it. <br /> <br /> Rate it. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think
