I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. is one of the few films ever made that I would consider romantic. try to talk about plot or performance or technical details of this film would be in the words of frank hoe "like dancing on architecture". it perfectly hits the nail on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments of life that move us and then run away from us to never be experienced again. this looks like the movie the version of charlie kaufman's character in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy end here, only mystery. no deep life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to experience the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 look at it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
