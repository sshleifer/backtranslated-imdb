It's nothing brilliant, innovative or innovative, but "Dog Days" is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's like CRASH stumbling into a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It is an Austrian film that follows the lives of many depressed, unbalanced and annoying people and their abusive relationships between them. It is disturbing, but very well played and it is interesting to observe the little crazy things of these characters. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusions or revelations in the end, we only see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days. Degree: B
