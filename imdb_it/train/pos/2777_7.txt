For some, this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation ... Others see it as a story of grace, restoration and hope ... Is it really both? Henry King illustrates the portrait of a powerful monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his spiral of sin and his rise of healing .. <br /> <br /> "David and Bathsheba" is a film full of vividly memorable emotions characters that reach mythical status while maintaining their humanity ... Henry King handles the powerful story, taken from the Old Testament, with skill ... David, "the lion of Judah", after storming the walls of Rabgah , saves the life of one of his loyal warriors Uriah (Kieron Moore), and returns to Jerusalem ... <br /> <br /> Back to his court, his first wife complains of negligence, and offends him for being the son of a pastor, who stands out for being the daughter of King Saul ... <br /> <br /> One evening, as he walked on the terrace of his palace that evidently had an imposing view of the neighborhood, the eyes of David happened to light a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath ... It was beautiful and attractive ... David could not take his eyes off her ... he discovers later that she was the wife of one of his officers ... <br /> <br /> Sending her, he discovers that she too he is unhappy in his marriage ... At this point, it is clear that David's intentions shift from an interest in taking Bathsheba as his wife, to simply taking Bathsheba ... As usual, sin has had its consequences, and David had not foreseen that possibility ... <br /> <br /> When a drought sweeps the earth away and there is a threat of famine, David suspects that the Lord is punishing him and his people for his sin ... But when Bathsheba tells him it's pregnant and afraid that she may be stoned to death according to the law of Moses, David tries to hide his sin ... <br /> <br /> Send a word to Joab, the commander of his army, and orders him to send to him the husband of Bathsheba ... David did something that was abominable in the eyes of God ... Send the man to the front line where he would be killed ... <br /> <br /> The soldier is really killed and Removing him, David marries his beloved Bathsheba in full royal splendor ... <br /> <br /> God punishes the couple when Bathsceba's son dies immediately after birth ... Meanwhile, a powerful famine has spread throughout the earth and the Israelites - led by Nathan - blame the king for their situation ... They arrest the palace and demand that Bathsheb to pay for his sin ... <br /> <br /> Peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire exceeded his common sense and integrity .. <br /> <br /> Hayward as Bathsheba, is a woman sensitive that begins to believe that every disaster that occurs in his life is the direct result of his adultery ... The sequence of his bath which may have been a great moment in the history of the biblical film, is poorly managed and the eyes of the spectators are led briefly on Hayward's face and shoulders ... <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey appeared as Nathan the Prophet, sent by God to scold David after his adultery with Bathsheba; Gwyneth Verdon is the queen Michal who tries to resist ambition and greed that have become an integral part of David's personality and royalty; the former idol of the silent screen, Francis X. Bushman, had a brief part as King Saul ... <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were: The Ark en route to his permanent home when God breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object; the decisive moment in David's life when he confesses his sin and is ready to accept his punishment of death; and for the climax of the film, inserting it as a flashback, David recalling his struggle with the giant Goliath ... <br /> <br /> With a superb color photograph and a masterful soundtrack, "David and Bathsheba" have won the Oscar nominations in the following categories: Scoring of music, Art and direction of the set, Photography, Stories and screenplays and Costumes ..
