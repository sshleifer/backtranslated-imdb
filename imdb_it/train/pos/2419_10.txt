In addition to Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is John Candy's funniest movie. When he is hypnotized with the playing card (similar to the Manchurian Candidate) and becomes a horny boy who does not know what he is saying, he makes two very memorable quotes (both deal with the male anatomy). The love scene involving shopping items must be seen, cannot be described. <br /> <br />
