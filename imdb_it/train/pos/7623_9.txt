Initially reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of the "Lost" vision, I accidentally captured an episode at the beginning of season 1, the one with the polar bear and has since had my undivided attention. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. So bear (heh) with me as I throw out so many semi-coherent praise that I can muster. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people crashing into a desert island, and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its premise exploring each character deeply and smoothly ?? what drives them, who are they? Where they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island on which they are trapped acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are running away from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or coming into contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire) . But even "Lost" enlarges the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses ... and they all seem strangely connected. <br /> <br /> While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting ability, most of the cast of "Lost" are, in reality, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting the heart and humor in their performances. There is also a multitude of eyecandy, but not generally Hollywood-type like most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and are extremely addictive to watch. Their interactions are rarely prey to a predictable sweetness, insignificant discussions or a mischievous melodrama (even if they are annoyingly secretive) ?? these people first try to survive and any relationship appears to be secondary to the action. The realism of these characters facilitates an already well-sculpted plot. <br /> <br /> Information on this plot ... Imagine a tree as a pattern plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, a branch for each character) ?? well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as to other narrative lines. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters in flashbacks, you'll get your storyline. If you are a DOG you will have your plot. Unless the writers manage to weave them all together in a glorious climax, in the end, they are setting themselves up. I'm more than a little worried that there will be disappointing cop-outs for this show, as I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But assuming the authors do it, "Lost" is probably the best show ever to hit television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
