"Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what he did wrong rather than what he did, and it's a shame, because the latest chronological episode in the Star Wars saga is a brilliant example of an epic narrative. He manages to put all the stories from the previous films into a grand finale, and he does it very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are the Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that probably served to widen the Star Wars demography - and in the middle the film tends to slow down a bit. But the last hour is probably the best piece in the whole saga, where Luke finally finds himself face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in film history. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi has done so many things that people tend to overlook: it has presented an incredible conclusion to the plot of Darth Vader (which has gone from implausible in "Empire Strikes Back" to a lot convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterly performance of Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor, Luke finally coming to his, the resolution of the love story of Solo and Leia, and the extremely powerful final moments of the moon of Endor. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are slight inconveniences. But it is the annoyances of a generation of spectators who have had time to silence every single scene. It is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a good movie - it's great!
