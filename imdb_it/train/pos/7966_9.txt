As a child I thought this movie was fantastic. He had animals, he had beautiful music and he had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I love this movie, for different reasons. It has well-trained animals that are subjected to various stunts and scenes that look excellent on the camera. He has a beautiful and well-written musical that fits the scene perfectly, with melodies with a fast-paced rhythm and the main harrowing theme, which still makes me cry. Even when people hum. And he has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on a book, this is the story of three domestic animals, an intelligent laboratory, excessively trusting and considerably paternal with the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still intelligent - cat with a afraid of the water called Sassy and a ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic street bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family leaves. Bewildered and worried, the animals go wild and organize a journey through the mountains of the Sierra for the journey of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So perhaps the house is just above that mountain. But what happens if it isn't? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for people who like the three fantastic actors who provide voices for lead animal characters, and for anyone else who ... yes, everyone goes to see it.
