I absolutely love this game to die for. Since I was 9 (now I am 15). It has fantastic graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions and does not forget the formidable forms of the dragon! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> Play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be a true hero. In this adventure you meet wonderful creatures and boss battles. You also meet some friends on the street who have their special element. Like Fire, Darkness, Water / Ice, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Light and Wind. There are also objects known as dragon spirits, which allow you to transform yourself into magical legendary creatures. Dragons, magicians, creatures called aliens and evil creatures that you will have to face in this adventure full of emotions and excitement. One of my favorite games of all time, The Legend of Dragoon!
