I'm an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, especially "Henry Fool" from 1997. "Fay Grim" is a sequel to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (brilliantly played by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to trace the books of her missing husband and finds herself between conspiracies and espionage. The supporting cast (most of the people from the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a very welcome return from the Indian-beloved Elina Lowensohn of the 90s) is excellent and the film has many surprises. The director states that it is part of a "Star Wars" trilogy, which serves as the "Empire Strikes Back" series If this is true, I can't wait to see the third episode! I just hope I don't have to wait another 10 years for this.
