This is a truly memorable spaghetti western. He has a fantastic plot, interesting characters and a very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. His evil wickedness in this film is truly classic. He steals every scene he finds himself in and he expresses so much with his face and eyes, even when he's not talking. His performance is very credible. He can be rather hypnotizing without being over the top (not that there is something wrong with being overdone). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this film too. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent, and the song is the kind that will play constantly in your head for days after watching the movie, if you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very funny. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There is also a lot of sweetened which is very well done. <br /> <br /> I probably would have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first is a stupid bar fight that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous fights I've ever seen in a movie. It is very badly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number than a bad musical than any real combat. One might be able to overlook this if it was a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the fight really should have been more realistic. The other thing that bothered me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican shoulder. I guess it should have been a comic relief or something, but the character was just stupid and useless in a movie like this, and it wasn't funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> All that has been said, let everyone know that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western, despite the flaws I mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.
