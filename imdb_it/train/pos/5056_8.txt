The radio was not a 24-hour weekly seven-hour week when I grew up in 1930s England, so Children's Hour was a pleasure for me when we had the batteries and an accumulator to spare for power. The few programs I listened to made a big impression on my young mind, and the 3 I remember are still "Toytown", one on all the animals at the Zoo, and --- Gray Owl, talking about the animals he knew, which he called his brothers". Only recently did I learn that Gray Owl was not a true "Indian", but the tribute paid by the Sioux chief makes a lot of sense to me "A man becomes what he dreams". We would like all of us to be able to dream like the changing and beneficial world like Archie Gray Owl Belaney. I wish a new Gray Owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment.
