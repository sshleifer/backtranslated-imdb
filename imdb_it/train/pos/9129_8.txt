When this film was released in 1984, Prince was one of the most famous actors around. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which wasn't much more than an extended music video. The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from the musicians who are acting on the big screen for the first time? Nevertheless, it was still a very funny movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer some classic comedies of all time, especially their version of "The Password", which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their "who is on the frontline" baseball routine. <br /> <br /> Appolina (who went with a single name then) provided nice breasts, so you had the brief covered nudity. Moreover, it is very attractive. And, of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. The prince later had a bad blow with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular moment in his career, he was at the top of his career. <br /> <br /> This film is not the big category of the first time, but it is quite funny.
