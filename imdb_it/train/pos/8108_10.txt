I have, "Things to come", on D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS version. Audio is right, but sometimes it can be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I looked for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the little things that I didn't notice at the beginning. For example, John Cabal plays with a toy airplane at a Christmas party, as if he were a scuba bomber, released with the power of the sea by naming a warship, "Dinosuar". Ships sunk by the air force, an illegal undeclared enemy attack by airplanes. He swept the planes of the flying wings. Strong rolls for women through the entire movie. <br /> <br /> What's more, watch the movie to enjoy them.
