If you advance quickly through the horrible song, you'll find a classic fairy tale below. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good at the role. Its characteristic acting style works well for the puss in boots. The other actors are good for their parts. I didn't find any terribly false or embarrassing acting. The king in particular looks like a real donkey, and I wonder if it should be. I can't remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated prices we see today. Overall, I recommend this film for children and adults who are children at heart.
