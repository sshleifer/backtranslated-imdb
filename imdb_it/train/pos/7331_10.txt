In a moment of magic, barbarians and demons abound in a diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the kingdom of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by King Jerol but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra was kidnapped by the warriors of Nekhron, a warrior named Larn must protect her and must defeat Nekhron from conquering the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> An epic fantasy of well done and excellent underrated subtlety that combines live actors with the animation tracked on them (rotoscoping), is Ralph Bakshi's second best film with "American Pop" as number one and "Heavy Traffic" in third place and "Wizards" in fourth place. It's definitely better than its "Cool World" or "The Lord of the Rings", the work is designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has a nice color and there's even a bomb for the boys. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to lovers of fantasy and animation everywhere, especially the new 2-Disc limited edition DVD by Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Black Cauldron", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian" "," The Wizard of Oz "," Rock & Rule "," Wizards "," Heavy Metal "," Starchaser: Legend of Orin "," Fantastic Planet "," Princess Mononoke "," Nausicca: Valley of the Wind "," Conan The Destroyer "," Willow "," The Princess Bride "," The Lord of the Rings (1978) "," The sword in the stone "," Excalibur "," Army of darkness "," Krull "," Dragonheart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," Return of the King (1980) ", "Conquest", "American Pop", "Jason and The Argonauts", "Clash of the Titans", "The Last Unicorn" "," The Secret of the NIMH "," The Flight of the Dragons "," Hercules (Disney) " , "Legend", "The Chronicles of Narnia", "Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire".
