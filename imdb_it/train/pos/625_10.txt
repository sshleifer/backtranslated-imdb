This afternoon we took the kids to the cinema and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It is rare that he is completely taken aback by anything, but this is probably the biggest fantasy film I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it's all Neil Gaiman's fault. Of course, I could have been sucked into the wonderful dialogue that was intelligent, flowed smoothly and made the characters completely believable. <br /> <br /> I could go on for days on the spectacular acting, Charlie Cox is as perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is as brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as Deeply in the Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy born of the humor that succeeded in Laughing our Loud fun, clever enough to make the first Shrek similar to a Sitcom from the 80s, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the film would have made this a fantastic film. <br /> <br /> The special effects were almost perfect, t this was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used they were exactly what was required, not too much to distract you from the movie itself and fit perfectly into the story. <br /> <br /> Then there is the story? What can I say. How many times you come across a story that contains all the classic components of a fairy tale formula that does not present itself as another economic knockoff of Princess Bride. It manages to be familiar and comfortable, but at the same time completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> Each of those things would have made this film a good movie, all together making it a fantastic but pale film compared to the rich enchanted world that these elements combine to make one live well. Once again Neil Gaiman did it, he drove another dagger in my heart creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do anything to live there and just give me a brief look. I didn't want it to end, I wanted to be sucked into a storm vortex by Stormhold and meet Tristan and Yvaine personally, travel through his fields and valleys, walk through his markets and meet his inhabitants, both dangerous and friendly, and stay there forever . It's a feeling I noticed every time I read something about Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over, I couldn't see anything more in the worlds that had created that seemed much more vivid and alive than the one in which I am forced to live and looking at Stardust was no different. In the end I'm sure Neil's script and this film won't have the same effect on everyone, but believe me when I say you won't regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it's easily one of the first 5 movies I've ever seen and I can guarantee everyone with a soul at least will like it.
