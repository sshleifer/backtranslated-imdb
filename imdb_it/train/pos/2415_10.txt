I'm totally addicted to this show. I look forward to the week to see the next screening. it's a great storyline and has the best actors and actresses on the show. I'll tune in every week to watch it even if I'm not at home, I always have my VCR on the band of the monarch's bay. simon rex is the best actor on the show. it's full of suspense and exciting. I think this show should stay on the air and I think everyone should tune in to watch it. I saw the first episode and actually I wouldn't have seen it but I was watching a whole day for life and I decided to watch it because it was on and I love it and right now it's my favorite show. I'm really serious about it.
