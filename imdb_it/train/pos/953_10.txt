Much richer in texture and character than even the classics of the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought on the screen a richer Scrooge, more robust and at the same time deeper than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century London. Scott seemed to take Scrooge to a more personal, understandable but highly confrontational level; his role was interpreted with the great authority that Scott always brought on the screen: however his usual bellicose voice would have been sometimes whispered, almost like a soliloquy, as if he rebuked the Christmas holidays in one breath, revealing his human frailty in his next line. He could depict Scrooge sour and crunchy and Scrooge misunderstood and understanding in the same scene. <br /> <br /> Truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation.
