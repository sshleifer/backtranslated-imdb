The costumes and makeup were great, there were some exceptionally fun lines, and the role was done for Jim Carrey. Carrey did a good job as could be done, given the rather disappointing script. Sure, it was mostly a children's movie, but if you're going to spend a lot of money on making a movie, you should at least give the story enough body to go beyond Dr. Seuss's. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth seeing, but it does not have the qualities necessary to become a great classic, in any case.
