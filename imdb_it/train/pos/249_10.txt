I've seen the trailer for this movie several times and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I couldn't take my eyes off that (it certainly caught my attention). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think this film will be a success, and my many people will be seen over and over again.
