I didn't like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen his other films. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is well done. It looks real. As Satya of RGV did. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of the so-called high society is the summary of the film. In the midst of all diseases, it is difficult to lead a normal life that the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to watch with children or expect wives. Page 3 of the newspapers is the usual place to report the activities in progress in the parts of the rich and the elite that concede much more filth than reported. As this Page-3 is also a business perspective is shown in the film. Event management companies are paid to organize parties and make famous but not famous celebrities overnight by clicking on photographs with celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has crept into the high society of Mumabi. The film shows him boldly, with no holds barred. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
