Here is proof of why Mary Pickford was "America's Beloved." In this rather complex drama, Maria interprets the young daughter of an abusive who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "hill hills". The scenes in which they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delicious. She is also willing to take a bath. That Mary can wrest this role from the age of 30 is simply amazing and somehow due to her petite stature (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess faces many physical and emotional challenges. He does it with sperm not seen in many heroines of the time. Tess packs a wall and isn't shy about fighting anyone. Because she agrees to help the "hill mouse" daughter outside of me, but sacrifices her happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close-ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Jean Hersholt, from Denmark, is simply as wonderful as the villain. The scene in which you handle a small child is enough to make you throw vegetables (or anything else) on the movie screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Papa Skinner) had worn a beard, would it have been a match for the model used in those Uncle Sam recruitment posters from World War I? Wants You! <br /> <br /> Although the story is quite predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth investing in your time to see the piece or the pure "American". The film highlights the choices available to us that involve everyone, making someone else happy and what it means to be a true Christian. Recommended.
