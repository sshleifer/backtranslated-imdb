This is one of the best crime dramas in the late 1990s. He was full of an exceptional cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was fantastic; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good, as long as the viewer didn't care about his Louuu-siana accent. It could be boring if you can't stand this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic and slightly comic at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this photo mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take a second remark to remember "what Zapatti was?" After so many cross-references, one must stop and think only of recapitulating. The finish did not have much sting. It was built for so long and then it was a bit disappointing. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the film was not advertised as a huge, successful success, it made us forget that this film existed. Pacino and Aiello were fantastic, but the lack of "splash" in the theaters of the film did not represent any nomination. It has had some success in the domestic market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Built in 1996, it still stands today and will remain popular for many years to come. <br /> <br /> So make some lemon pudding (you'll see) and watch this movie!
