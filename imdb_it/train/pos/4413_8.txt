Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original screenplay and was shot in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. To free the photo they change the original name in Cuba Libre. The director's cut lasted 3 and a half hours. It was published in the Bangkok festival in Thailand. It was the second film by Gael Garc√≠a Bernal (the first was Amores Perros) <br /> <br /> and the first by Juan Gerard as director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the baby's mother. They are great actresses and keep the story together specifically for Diana. Check it out in other things that will surprise you.
