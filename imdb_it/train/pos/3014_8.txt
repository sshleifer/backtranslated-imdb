This fantastic whodunit is a first prototype of what soon became a very popular genre of movies. I was happy to see William Powell run a detective novel with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). While the story is beautiful on its own, I think what makes this movie fun to watch is the fantastically imaginative direction of Michael Curtiz. From a visual point of view, this is a film rich in texture, with Curtiz showing an incredible mastery of the medium; from split screen images to strange camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz proves to be one of Hollywood's best directors. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of film.
