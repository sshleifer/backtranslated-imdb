What happens to washing rock-n-roll stars in the late 90s? They launch a return / reunion tour. At least, this is what the members of Strange Fruit, an imaginary 1970s rock band, do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has a concession on condom vending machines when he meets the son of the promoter of a famous music festival. It was at that festival in the 1970s that Strange Fruit broke up. The 70s are "retro" and the time is right to expand that wave. Start searching for other band members. <br /> <br /> Part of what destroyed the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the singer and brilliant song writer. The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all again among the working class they came from. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layabout, the bass player is a roofer, and their singer is still a rocker. While he owned a large villa, he was forced to sell it, since his fortune did not last. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> With a little reluctance the band agrees to try the reunion. Leaving their daily jobs, they start trying, and their manager approaches the label to reissue their albums. But he wants the tour to start again first. And so they hit the club circuit across Europe. The club scene is not nice to these old, overweight, outdated, old players. <br /> <br /> It is on tour that the film really begins to develop. All the old conflicts arise, with the figures of Keith and Brian roaming everywhere. They are all hanging because they are all looking for a second chance at the greatness that has eluded them before. And they rediscover part of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so pleasant. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film, following the reports of the band members. While it's still a very funny movie, it's the evolving characters, struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and their personal demons, which make the movie work.
