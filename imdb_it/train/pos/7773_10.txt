Fabulous movie! He recently rented the DVD and was paved with this extraordinary work. Douglas Sirk was a film genius and played Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar-nominated) and Lauren Bacall that words can't describe. Paul Verhoeven has brilliantly paid tribute to this film by having Dorothy Malone play the inspirational murderer guru of Sharon Stone in his Basic Instinct. What a joke! <br /> <br /> In turn, the film is hilarious, compelling, captivating, pungent, unkempt, compelling and with open eyes! It is certainly the grandfather of all the big and small soap operas on the screen, but nobody had the dazzling style as you will see here: the camera work is fluid and smooth, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening assembly set on title song is beyond memorable, one-dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will make you scratch your head about how the censors can leave the final cut! <br /> <br /> Although older, highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring task to deal with, Written on the Wind contains so much and passes so quickly that it is actually a shame when it ends. Thanks to Mr. Sirk for the craft - and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to - what has now become one of my favorite movies of all time! SEE THIS FILM !!!
