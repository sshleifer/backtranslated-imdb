Like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), only more. There is more to it than anything, more animals, more various African tribes and scenes where thought must be, if this were good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan fights with crocodiles while the crocodile's car spins in the water like a rolling pin, all around, with its jaws flapping. Tarzan can kill him with his omnipresent knife if the devastated chestnut stops. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and an increasing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people wearing costumes of the largest monkeys and elephants. In fact, they use much more friendly and fitable Indian elephants than those with costumed ears attached to their heads. Human history: another white man, worse than the others, shows up to join Holt to go and look for the ivory from the elephant cemetery. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the villain shoots an elephant so they can follow him on his deathbed. Tarzan intercedes and the bad guy shoots him ?? but, of course, he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone dies, Holt and the villain and each of their "boys". People are expendable, especially Africans, and there doesn't seem to be much difference between the blacks who die because they work for the white men who travel through taboos and the blacks who kill them. This must be Tarzan's last film before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims naked, and although the light is flickering movement and foreshortenings are very attractive. Apparently one of Weismuller's friends on the Olympic swimming team did the nude scenes, and not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, moves through the film wearing the same kind of thong that Weismuller (plus a bikini top) wears, showing a splendid look of thigh and hips. They don't need to talk much yet. They sleep together and walk around with fantastic animals and stay away from the cities. No wonder they are happy.
