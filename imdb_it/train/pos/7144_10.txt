I saw the movie Holes and say it must be the best film for the whole year. Brings the child to everyone. I want to say who would get the idea of ​​having annoying kids digging holes for punishment? Louis Sachar this is who. Even though the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example Caveman / Stanley should have been the biggest one there. Wise weight and wise height but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and the axilla / Teodoro was bigger. Even X-Ray / Rex had to be one of the smallest, but it wasn't. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. I would have preferred to see more of the present than the past but this is just my opinion. I especially like the work of the boys. As if Squid / Alan was played by Jake M. Smith, he had to be a tough, moody boy. Jake M. Smith performed and did a great job as almost all the Holes actors. So I would say that if you haven't seen Holes yet then you should definitely see it when it comes out again or you'll lose a lot of fun.
