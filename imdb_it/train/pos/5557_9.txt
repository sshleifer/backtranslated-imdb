"A Mouse in the House" is a very classic Tom & Jerry cartoon, true to their tradition but with jokes aside. He is hysterical, hilarious, very funny and quite funny. The artwork is also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and is also trying to catch the mouse, because "there will only be one cat in this house in the morning - and this is the cat that catches the mouse". <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are a lot of fun gags in this cartoon. The funniest for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically says "I'm glad you're enjoying the siesta" and hopes they're satisfied because it's not, making the two cats wince. Another funny joke is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and bangs Butch with a pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course, even more fun than this, is when the real Mammy Two Shoes and both (stupid!) Appear. The cats think they see themselves disguised as Mammy and then both stick it on the "back" - lol. Of course she gets angry and once she gets angry, she's not someone to joke with. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he is also expelled from her.
