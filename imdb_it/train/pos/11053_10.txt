I wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show went on the air, but fortunately I managed to capture the mid-90s replicas and the rest is history ... The premise was pretty simple; two hardened Nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are associated with a doctor (and not a young one) experienced (if not young) (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous agent organic from China red use. While making their escape, their plane is hit by a machine gun fire and they crash into the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously unknown civilization that heals and improves the trio's senses, thus creating the scene for many exciting adventures to come ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30 hours and I think it was his relatively short life, a season that created him for cult status. <br /> <br /> Monty Berman, the producer, was famous for doing things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered from incredibly sticky sets - especially in episodes like "Happening" (a studio in replacing the Australian outback) and the "snow 'sets of" Operation Deep Freeze "and" The Beginning ", but if you can overcome this, and concentrate on the characters and narrative lines, the show was really fun. a great mix of adventure and a lot of impassive humor (mainly from some terrifying one liners by William Gaunt). <br /> <br /> The chemistry of the three leads was fantastic - you had the feeling that they really had fun a lot to do the show and this is confirmed in the documentary of the 2005 meeting in which the three meet after more than 35 years to remember the show (and laugh at Anthony Nicholl's terrible wig !!). Everyone shared the same time on the or screen and everyone had their moments to shine. I must say that I have always been a fan of Richard Barrett - I loved his sardonic humor and that dangerous limit - he was certainly a man you didn't cross, and those eyes ........ bluto eyes I would probably see him in TV. I have also followed Bill Gaunts' career with interest since then. However, Craig Stirling would surely have had his legion of female fans and I am sure that Alexandra Bastedo had a long line of male fans that would vanish for her too. <br /> <br /> The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> Notable episodes for me were "Auto Kill", "The Interrogation", "The Fanatics", "The Mission" and "The Gilded Cage", but I'm sure everyone has their favorites . <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this show for the first time, or to watch it again after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and sit and have fun: the characters and the chemistry of the three protagonists is what made this wonderful show for me and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
