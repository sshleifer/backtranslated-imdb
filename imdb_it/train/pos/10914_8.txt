I saw the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are definitely fantastic, but there's something terribly sweet about Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this movie. Jean Arthur SHINES when he looks at Powell. There is an unmistakable background that buzzes between them. This film may not have the intelligence of the Thin Man series, but undeniably makes up for it in charm. As I watched him, I thought Powell was doing an off-field relationship with Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is a movie in which I wish I could go back in time (crush and press my lips with Powell!) It seems that there is no end to his lovely playful smiles! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man". Ok, this sounds too boring, but I can't help myself.
