that's what I call a great movie. lives through the fantastic abilities of the actors and a simple but human story. there are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, as the live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people across the country (Yugoslavia) on the way to the capital Belgrad. the funny and cruel situations that happen along the way, connect people and pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> look at it and you'll remember it all your life ... it's full of Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> and another reason for its magic: it's hard to get !!
