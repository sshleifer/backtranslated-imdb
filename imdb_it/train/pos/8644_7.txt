**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in books and never forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see <br /> <br /> *** = A solid, useful, very funny piece <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = A good movie, but there are some irregular elements or defects obvious <br /> <br /> ** = It can still be considered good in the areas, but this work has serious problems or is held back by inevitable elements deemed inevitable (for example, genre) <br /> <br /> * 1/2 = Mostly a pile of nothing triggered by delicately useful moments <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not of visible quality <br /> <br /> - Kalifornia = *** <br /> <br /> - Not classified (for strong violent material, remarkable sexuality and language) <br /> <br /> I rented this film expecting an in-your-face-Blockbuster quality exhibition of Brad Pitt's face, but I was happily surprised and disappointed. This is really more of a drama, and very sad in this ... I remember some of Duchovny's emotional doubts. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his perhaps not sexy movie with an amazing talent. Who started out as a desperate but harmless husband of "white garbage" became aware of a violent and disturbing alcoholic with a messy mind. During some of the last stages of the film, I found it difficult to keep watching it: it was unpredictable and scary. This demonstrates excellent writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The entire film is full of bizarre and sensational scenes that have made me hold my breath no less than once, and I don't mean action scenes. I mean so brilliantly realized dialogue scenes that I actually startled and winced at what I was seeing. It was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other. Once again, I am very impressed with the writers; whoever did the impossible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare that this talented young actress makes an appearance these days when she does it is such a joy. Some of his moments in this film led me to cry. I meant that. The emotions that this girl can arouse in your head are incredible, and I clearly remember having blurry eyes on some occasions. It almost seems to me to cheat the quality craftsmanship that the directors showed by giving only "KALIFORNIA" a score ***. But the dark feelings it elicits are too powerful and depressing to lift it. I believe, however, that everyone should see this movie. I really know.
