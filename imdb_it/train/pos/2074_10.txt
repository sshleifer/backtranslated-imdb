Another big boxed 4 channel long before it's time. Fascinating acting by Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, smart and fun. I remember watching it at that time and even then, asking around, nobody had really heard of it. But trying to find someone who can remember it is even more difficult. Maybe Channel 4 doesn't do its job well enough to increase the necessary enthusiasm. Either that or the general public is too interested in TV Big Vomiting. I suspect that the latter. Garth Merengie's Dark Place download prompted Channel 4 to release a DVD of that series. We hope that the same can happen with North Square.
