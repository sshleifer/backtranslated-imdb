I watched this movie by accident, intrigued by the TV trailer. I like it when I discover films like this, little tender stories about ordinary people. Although the end is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has some fun moments, especially in Dani's first characterization, with his innocent and pure love affair with Court. It is really a beautiful love story in motion with 3 highlights: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who kept his promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful photograph of "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the fantastic soundtrack of James Newton Howard, who is really the soul of the film. His themes (which deserved an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have turned the script into music.
