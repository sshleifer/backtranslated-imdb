I was really excited to see this movie. I thought that Australia had finally made a good film ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt of a slasher film of all time. I'm sorry for Molly Ringwald who has to come to Australia to make a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible (especially that Australian guy who was trying to speak with an American accent), and the plot was also pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of this movie coming out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the "Stab" movie in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION !!! MAJOR SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the end. I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was ... but the killer wasn't even human ... which turned this realistic movie into a terrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. you will probably be disappointed!
