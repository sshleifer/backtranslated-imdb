this is really a pleasure for all Bolan fans, some may think it is a bit exaggerated, and that only concerns the ego of Ringo and Marc, but I think it's similar to any other concert video, except for the that this is Marc Bolan, not just any guy! I particularly liked the children's music video of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, I can't believe they haven't released this version as a single. The film is truly exceptional, especially for us Danes. Now, I wasn't alive during the 1970s. but the Danes in general were completely rejected by what was happening around them. the media didn't play or show any popular music back then, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a little with The Doors, only the very popular songs though. therefore, I know from my father, that seeing this, he gives back a part of his youth, he never had experience. <br /> <br /> I won't do it too long, so ... If you're the least Marc Bolan fan, you have to see it. you may find it boring or as mentioned before, a little exaggerated. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever, in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappoints me a little, is that Ride A White Swan is not on the tape. but they lose it, since Jeepster and Get It On sounded so wonderful.
