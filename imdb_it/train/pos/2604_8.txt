"Amazing Grace" looks languid as a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building tells. The spoken language is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. Observe family values, romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal security. He does not judge the characters, he presents them only directly, while they strive to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the acting is very good and the comments made on the characters are astute and precise. I really appreciate this smooth movie.
