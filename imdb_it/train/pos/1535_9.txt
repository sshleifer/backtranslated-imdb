Fortunately as a student I was able to see "Diagnosis Murder" for a number of years. It is basically a doctor who solves the murders with the help of his son LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM offered 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made him different from many other police shows and deserved to be watched many times was his cast and his quality of writing. The main cast gave good interpretations and the roots of Dick Van Dyke's entertainer shone with the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of the DM were the fast pace, the witty scripts and, of course, the finger typing score. Unfortunately it has been unfairly compared to "Murder, She Wrote". DM is far superior, boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now there is no more TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of good cop family shows. Now there are only depressing "gritty" ones.
