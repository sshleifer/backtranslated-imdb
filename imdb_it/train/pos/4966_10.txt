Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen years old in 1978, when Argentina won the World Cup at home. He was already the biggest star and the greatest player in a football-obsessed country. Everyone had asked Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy's genius, but the manager thought he wasn't ready yet. <br /> <br /> History records that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup quite convincingly: they didn't really need Maradona. The same was not true in 1982. Spain was a catalog of disasters for Argentina. Menotti - he still smoked the rope - played Diego this time, but the opportunity was too much for such a delicate boy. Maradona had signed for Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for about $ 7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the Camp Nou and Belgium beat Argentina one-zero. It was not an auspicious debut, and although he scored two goals against Hungary in the next match, Maradona will remember the mondial as the site of his nadir - a crude and petulant foul against the Brazilian Batista in the second round that he interrupted abruptly his tournament and the Argentine kingdom as world champions. <br /> <br /> But now he was all behind him. Maradona had become confused at some crazy moments at Barca, and left in 1984 to join Naples. It was like he was finally home. The Neapolitan fans had done everything to entice Maradona to the poor and very thin Napoli. Gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys thronged uncomfortably with the millions of the Camorra as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make him feel at home. So, at least for the moment, Maradona was El Rey - he brought his Argentine team to Mexico as one of the favorites, and with a new manager - Carlos Bilardo to replace Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, a winner of a man's World Cup. In 1982, hundreds of young men had died in a useless battle for the Falkland Islands; now the British press wanted a revenge (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona was still considered with distinction in England, remembered more for a superb performance in Britain during a 1980 tour than in Spain. But it was still an Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> In reality, England started well and Lineker could have scored after just twelve minutes. A key event happened in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the great and limited English defender, was hired: he was now terrified of making challenges around the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After the first 45 minutes of tension, the second half started with a bang. Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes, but failed to find the way. Similarly, Valdano's attempt only hit white shirts. So the moment of infamy that serves as Diego's epitaph. Hodge has bizarrely hooked the ball in his penalty area, Shilton rushed to claim - but there was Maradona, somehow over the English goalkeeper to put the ball into the net. How had he done it? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous foul in football history has passed in slow motion. Every spectator waited for Sir Al-Sharif of Syria to blow for the phallus (he didn't). Shilton looked and appealed to the linesman: he ran back to the center of the circle. Unless you murder the Pope, or become the first man to ascend to Mars, when the great man dies, this moment will be shown first - in a long, prolonged, slow movement, followed by the expression of joy on his face. The next image will be his next gift to the world - the best goal of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga stroked the ball to Maradona who was turning on the right side of his own half court. He spread out and quickly moved away from Beardsley and Reid. This was the real Diego - Butcher exploded and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick has now had the opportunity to stop the attack. Normally, he would have pointed his boot somewhere near Maradona's thigh - sure he would get a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had a brain wave - he hesitated, and decided to run to Maradona waving his arms - maybe he was trying to get him off? Diego shot at the door while Fenwick fell. The butcher ran alongside the genius as if offering encouragement. Shilton threw himself into a panic and Maradona turned around him and prepared to score. Now Butcher recalled his role and tried to paralyze the Argentine - instead he gave an extra touch to the shot, which broke the goal. England was returning home. <br /> <br /> During this magical Mexican summer, the world had found a successor for Pelé. In fact, the greatest player ever had been overcome - Pelé had been superb in 1958 and 1970, but had had great players around him. Maradona no. 1986 was his World Cup.
