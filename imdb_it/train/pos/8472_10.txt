I don't agree at all. I thought this was a great movie for children. I found wells from the island of Gilligans, and the promise of a newly known Dana Plato.it was disneylike and therefore cannot be overlooked as insignificant fluff. It was not scary and it was not destined to be. I wouldn't ruin the ending. But the way it was made was unusual. I want to say that the children's characters were fantastic and I didn't know what to expect at the end. The basis of the story also had much more to do with these children than you say that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially. also helps get out of a jam towards the end. It also has the advantage of not being too long. I think it gets less than 95 minutes
