... and the series makes you forget all this. I am about three years older than the children portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first post-college job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 1970s were a terrible time to be young - inflation, competing for minimal after-school activities - starting jobs with 30-year-olds, terrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of this and still manages to make the '70s fun, even for those of us old enough to know each other better. He can look at the 70s directly in the face - complete with authentic clothes over time - and yet fills the show with the hope of youth and the things that make high school and the university year both the best of times and the worst of times . Then there are the parents. The two young show-lovers - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have scary parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward even though they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally reached the periphery in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who waited for the 1960s to show their entire lives to give their strangeness to legitimacy. The friends of Eric, Fez, Kelso and Jackie complete the group representing respectively nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager on a suburban show, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards that were dealt to him even when those cards were distributed by largely absent and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, although the eighth season is delayed due to Eric's absence.
