This is a great "small" film. I say "small" because it doesn't have a hundred gunshots or a dozen explosions, like in a John Woo movie. Great shows by Roy Scheider and the three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the plot is more a thread than a washing machine - instead of everything that goes around, it seems that things get worse as the plot thickens. Wonderful end, very positive. I've never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can't be very different from the movie because it feels like you're watching an Elmore Leonard movie.
