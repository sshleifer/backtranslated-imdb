This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the first known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I was tuned in, just waiting for a decent TV movie, but I found myself drawn to the compelling way the story was told. As others have already said, there is a lot to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen versions. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit goes to Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent screenplay and direction draws the viewer until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. Even the acting of the whole cast is superb, especially that of the two protagonists, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing interpretations give their characters a lot of credibility, and the scene in which they have their first meeting committee after Perestroika is genuinely touching. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your yellow films with a little more depth and a little less shine, I strongly suggest you look for "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
