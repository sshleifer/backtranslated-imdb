I love ghost stories in general, but I LOVE PARTICULARLY the ghost stories of the English style period, cold, atmospheric and elegantly disturbing. This qualifies on all fronts. A naive young lawyer ("solicitor" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the sea to arrange an estate for an elderly and deceased woman. These are the twenties, a time when many middle-class Englishmen go on holiday at sea for "their health". Well, guess what, there is nothing "healthy" in the village of Crythin Gifford, the gruesome site of the massive Victorian estate of the elderly woman, which is located on the edge of a salt marsh shrouded in mist. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals will help the tot in danger - find out why later in the film), inadvertently running into the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. It is not a film, a gaudy specter, but a solid black silhouette of malice and wickedness. The observer sees it only a few times, but you feel his malevolent presence in every frame. As the camera approaches the lawyer as he reads the legal documents, you expect to see the woman in black at any moment. When the lawyer goes out into the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the old creepy house, the camera hits him and you think she will jump out too. Waiting for the woman in black to show up is full of suspense. We have already seen many elements of this story (the locked room that no one enters, the fog, the naive stranger who ignores the warnings of the locals) but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new apparent ghost and irresistible history. Watch it with a friend so you can have someone warm to grab while waiting for the woman in black. . .
