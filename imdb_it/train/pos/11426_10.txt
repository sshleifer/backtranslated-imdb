I think this film would be more enjoyable if everyone had thought of it as an image of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s, rather than as a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette on top of another like little light spots that don't mean much until you have enough to paint an image. The first time I saw Chocolat I didn't really "understand" it until I thought about it for a few days. Then I realized that there were many things to "get", including the end of colonialism that was around the corner, just a plot. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene at the airport with the short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, don't watch them - you'll be bored with tears. But, for some of you ..., you can thank me later for recommending it.
