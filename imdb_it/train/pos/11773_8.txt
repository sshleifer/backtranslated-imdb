A large Bugs Bunny comic from previous years has Bugs as a performer in a shop window of a local department store. After the day is over, the manager arrives to tell him he will move soon. Bugs is happy to be content with understanding that the new job is taxidermy ... and that taxidermism has to do with stuffed animals. Animals as they say, a certain rabbit. This causes a battle of ingenuity between the rascal rabbit and his current former employer. I found this short to be delicious and certainly one of the best of the early 1940s. It still remains fun almost 60 years later. This animated short film can be seen on Disc 1 of Volume 2 of Golden Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
