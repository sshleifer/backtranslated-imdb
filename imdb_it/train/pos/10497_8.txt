I thought it was excellent and I still do it. I am grateful that we are still able to see things other than what Hollywood almost overwhelms us with. Saving Grace is smart and fun - those who feel offended by the marijuana thing go to see the American bride movie. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid. I was laughing out loud during most of it, but also reflecting on the questions about which was the main female character who was supposed to do to pay the debts of her deceased. <br /> <br /> In short - a witty plot with typical English humor and good acting and directing. You couldn't ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
