The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. He shows us the tsarist general, the great duke Sergio (Emil Jannings) in his glory days. In 1917 it had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial Russia it has nothing. He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). About ten years later, he plays a small part in a film about the revolution. His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who chooses whether to take it as an extra film or not. The last command is a very good silent drama. Emil Jannings plays a memorable role at the top. Evelyn Brent is wonderful to play the female lead. William Powell is as big as ever. There are a lot of scenes to remember in this movie. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. And then there's the finale with Powell and Jannings. This is a film that touches in many parts.
