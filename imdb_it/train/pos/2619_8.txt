If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Just like the catchy movie by Tom Stoppard, we can see the action from the point of view of two of the lesser characters of the original: Timon, the meerkat with a weakness for the song that is sung in the blink of an eye and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence problems. Following their story - rather than Simba's - we can see why all the animals bowed as Simba was presented by Pride Rock. Let's find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba on Pride Rock to hunt Scar. And we find out how they dealt with the hyena once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It's also nice to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg resume their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device that doesn't always help advance the story. That said, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the film. With more laughter than any other film in the third series in a Disney series movie, it's worth watching Hakuna Matata - if only for the hot tub scene that is still fun despite being somewhat predictable.
