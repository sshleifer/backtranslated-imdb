Reed Hadley makes Don Diego crazier than him by a brave and daring Zorro, but this is almost irrelevant because this serial features the bar: none of the best songs of all the serials, ever - and the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous stunt . There are other good stunts, and a lot of action, and a lot of terminations of captains that make your hair stand up, but if for no other reason, you have to watch this movie to watch the stagecoach stunt, then watch it again in slow motion. It's incredible and, despite the lower budget for this theatrical chapter, Yak performs better in this acrobatics than in the much more famous film "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart: this is the real deal!
