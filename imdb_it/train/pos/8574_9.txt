Huge fun for both adults and children, this film works on many levels: everything from road accidents and cake in the face to some very good (but subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is at his best sublime evil like Cruella ("call me Ella") De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years in the Clinic for the modification of the behavior of dr. Pavlov is she cured of her desire for fur ?? even the puppy leather fur he had longed for. It even has all its fur coats placed in the dungeons of the extraordinary castle in which it lives. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a "Dalmatian" film without the subterfuges and machinations of Crudelia and you know that something will change its behavior modification. And now he needs an extra puppy (then 102 Dalmatians) to complete his nefarious scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is instantly attractive as the hero of the film that runs the Second Chance shelter for dogs. Although it was in "Titanic" and last year's TV version (like Pip) of "Great Expectations" I didn't recognize it; well, he was the "fifth Lowe officer" in "Titanic" and I didn't see "Great Expectations" so I'm not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a delightful turn as the furrier-pledge of Cruella. Prances and postures in the most extravagant and outrageous fur clothing you've ever seen ?? and does it well. His tribute 'Wicked Witch of the West' is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is superb is the not so evil henchman of Cruella ?? he was also Alonzo, the butler of Cruella, in the "101 Dalmatians" and you could even recognize him from all the Brit-Coms of "Black Adder". He plays his usual grumpy, kind-hearted, slightly pungent character with great effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costumes are generally indicated for the entire costume in a film. This is unfortunate how the clothing worn by Glenn Close is incredible ?? it's incredibly detailed (note his handcuffs when released from the Behavior Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an exaggerated character. His clothes deserve at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation occupies a special place in my heart ?? but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmati" is even better than the film version of "The charge of the 101 Dalmatians" which came out in 1996. Here there is much to appreciate: from the gags of sight, the dialogues and costumes to the casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
