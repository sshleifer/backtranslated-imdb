In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was really diabolical. You should see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite having done a lot of cleaning, Cinderella (the voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful woman. For me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before concluding, I would like to say that all the protagonists of this film went very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You feel comfortable, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
