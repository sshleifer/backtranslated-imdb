The family is made up of two families chasing after blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a underworld don, operating from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once he accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, a wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother is ready to take revenge for his brother's death. Kidnap Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs, the expression matters most. Akshay's tiny role also put him on a par with Amitabh. I didn't understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were some weaknesses in the script; like it; Amitabh has been listed as the most wanted criminal in the city, yet he walks without making holes in the city. Even the kidnapping of his family seemed vague. How can the family of such a big don not have any security coverage?
