I watched this film without knowing anything about it and found it similarly to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a relationship between father and son in difficulty. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father in the mines and dreams of a better life far from their hometown. Both children face the derision of their classmates and both have a strong female model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I noticed between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern plays a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he continued to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, very different from his other features like Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
