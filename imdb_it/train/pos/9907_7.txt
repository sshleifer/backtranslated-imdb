"Slaughter High" is, perhaps, the most underrated slasher film of the 80s. It is one of the few films of its kind that is passionate in everything. Having said that, it is also based on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women are killed one at a time until the final battle. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" is superior to most films of its kind is more exaggerated. Marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. They lightened him in the shower of a girl's locker room, planted his horse with a javelin and, finally, they rigged his scientific laboratory experiment so he could deface it. <br /> <br /> So the victims of this film are as unlikely as you are. When they meet years later, in a high school meeting organized by Marty himself, you understand that they are no longer mature. They are a group of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It's amazing why they don't ask why they were the only ones attending the meeting, which, by the way, is held in a school since then fell into disrepair. And who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor in the abandoned building in a room where old cabinets - like Marty's - are on display? There are many leaps of faith that the viewer must take to enjoy this movie. The ending has little or no meaning. And the writers have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works: the film claims that jokes are no longer allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> In all, the film is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It's hard to see why he hasn't found his way to the DVD yet, when so many other slasher films have been embellished with special editions.
