After Dark, My Sweet is a great modern noir, full of squalid characters, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the great noirs of the last two or three decades took place in the South, where the men shine and the ladies, er, also shine. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And since everyone seems to be wetter (at least men do it - sweaty women leave me sticky). <br /> <br /> However - there may be spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be - a steady rhythm (although some with attention disorders refer to it as "lenses"), clearly and widely designed characters (although not simple), and tons of atmosphere. The Noir, if anything, concerns moods and attitudes. That's why the greats are not marked by your traditional definitions of "big" acting (see Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style, elegance and in a crime film is exactly what you want). or fast-paced adventures (again all the big noirs seem to be on a slow fire like a cigarette). The big noirs create an environment and you get used to it with the characters for a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet we do so - and it makes you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - they never allow the public to know what makes them really interesting - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are perfect, Dern in particular (see previous comment). They take the basic lines of a character and give them depth and arouse our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story is also interesting. There are better plots in the world of noir (almost no mystery here - mostly it's suspense), but this is solid. If anything, the simply "ok" plot has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. With Thompson, the plots are almost secondary; he avoided the labyrinthine narratives of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger and more confused characters. Watch a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you'll immediately see (from the title) what it is. When it comes to Thompson, this is not what it is about, but how it is (to quote Roger Ebert). So, actually, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping isn't the point and, if you don't like it, well the jokes about you. <br /> <br /> Because this is an 8-star movie, rather than a 10-star one, because of the female lead. It's not bad, per se, but it's not Angelica Huston or Anette benning (see Jim Thompson's The Grifters adaptation if you don't know what I'm talking about - it's also a better film and you should start there for contemporary noir - It's the best of the 90s and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best from Chinatown). He just doesn't have the ribs (or the appearance of the case) and although she and Patric have some chemistry, I don't have it with her. So there.
