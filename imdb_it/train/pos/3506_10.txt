Peter Sollett has created a captivating portrait of real people living in poverty on the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as the locals know. <br /> <br /> Sollett's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family, typical of the country's various "inner cities". Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he presents. These are basically good boys, the children of the parents who left them and whose grandmother took her under his wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive side that all of them have. These children are not drug addicts or steal because they are poor. If this story had been made by Hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of children struggling, but deep down they are not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is natural. This is July, Mars. His character shows us a senseless girl who will not be deceived or pushed to do something she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, like the grandmother is excellent. She conveys her frustration at not being able to guide her grandchildren to the things she believes in and that are so important to her. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was an excellent image thanks to Peter Sollett.
