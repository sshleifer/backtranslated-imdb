I was in a bad mood when I first saw this movie. For some reason he has clicked on all my levels, the tensions in a family, the loneliness and the lack of someone to share your life with. It didn't hurt that someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the soundtrack of this movie (very difficult to get). I liked it and hopefully one day it will come out in DV
