A sweet little movie that would not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to be cut from the same fabric as half a dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... the loser is confronted with adversity, finds the strength to challenge and learn something about yourself in the process. <br /> <br /> Widowed and so broken, Grace is a master gardener, and he is drafted to help his friend / employee Matthew cultivate his potted plant. He got it all wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize they are the perfect person to collect the dish, which they can both benefit from. He loves smoking, he needs to raise money to pay off his mortgage. Highlight is Grace who travels to London to take care of some of her articles, dressed in what looks like the white dress worn by John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever" and which then stretches like a sore thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always watchable, and it can't be said of many people ... well, I can't, anyway. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, which I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply moving or insightful, but immensely fun, and with a good dose of 90 minutes, it seems like a walk with friends. 8/10.
