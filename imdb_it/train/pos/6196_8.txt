Fay, the sister of the notorious Nobel laureate Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool. Their son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an undisclosed sender and follows a chase across three continents, involving a collection of extremely extremely sad government agents, terrorists, flight attendants and delivery men. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey offers a perfect comic performance, including brilliant physical work. With the strong contributions of Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim demonstrates in the best tradition of Billy Wilder that nothing is more fun than a beautiful woman in difficulty. <br /> <br /> Another good Hartley score (and thanks in credits to the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley worked as a colleague in autumn 2004).
