I don't usually like reality shows, especially those that take advantage of the success of "American Idol". But this I can live with. <br /> <br /> Comedians from around the world perform a short routine for celebrity talent scouts, and if they like them, those guys will be sent to perform a routine for a real audience. Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live together in a house and make "Survivor" style contests using comic tactics. So one will be determined as "Last Comic Standing". I like to raise the comedy, so this is the only reality show that has to interest my interests. There are usually some pretty funny comics selected. He started his career with talents like Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticisms are the fact that there is the possibility that many of these comics have been selected for their contribution to the drama show reality. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they are done with that, thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of comedians I've heard, they were chosen not because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc., when other comics should have clearly beaten them. But overall, it's a well-made reality show, which are two terms so far I thought were an oxymoron.
