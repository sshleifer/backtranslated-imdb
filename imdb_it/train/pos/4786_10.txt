The Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives through the state line. He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower because he can't drive and he wants to make the ride alone. The film beautifully describes his journey and the lives he touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays a beautiful performance like the rest of the cast, particularly Sissy Spacek in a captivating performance like his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role. > <br /> At first I felt that the story of an old journey through the countryside would be boring, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all the insights of human life, makes it a film that I would recommend to anyone.
