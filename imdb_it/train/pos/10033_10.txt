The Titanic movie makes it much more than just a "night to remember". He writes a tragic event in history that will always be discussed and that will never be forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. They could / will never make a movie like Titanic that is so touching and moving every time you look at it. They could never replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director undoubtedly had the greatest impact on the film. A simple catastrophic film (boring to watch) converted into an incredible love story. Yes, I'm not even the Romance type, but it shouldn't bother you, because you'll never see a love story like this. Guaranteed! All for the amazing effects, for the music, for the sublime acting. <br /> <br /> The film creates an incredible graphic and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and alive. The same legend "TITANIC" is shown brilliantly in all classes, it seems too, too accommodating. Acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best in acting roles. No one could have done better. Part of the reason why the film is so great. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's too much to talk about. The plot is simple, the acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of the consumers watching the film will share tears, thanks to an unimaginable ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you didn't watch this movie you missed something about Hesterical, and a movie to idolize for Hollywood. Could you improve? No, absolutely no. The most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself, then you'll understand. A reference point. (don't be surprised if you cry too)
