I chose this film based on the plot summary and the critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not great in foreign films and I didn't know what to expect. I'm not really interested in subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple and lovable quality that makes you feel good about life. I found myself laughing out loud over and over again. I would recommend this image to anyone, even to those who dislike foreign films with subtitles. This is worth it.
