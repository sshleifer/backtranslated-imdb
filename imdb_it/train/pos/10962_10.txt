It is interesting how the search train can flow. I started watching an article on "The Gates" of Christ in Central Park. The article stated that the Maysles had been the filmmakers of Christ for years. Hmmm ... Then I got to watch their work. I believe one of them has passed, but the other continues to film Christ and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. The Gray Gardens seemed very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the place to look for the dark or unusual and obviously have it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and oh what a glorious past it was. Edith had been wealthy, Bouvier was born, married well, had wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was about forty. His daughter Edie had been a debutante, a fashion model and had many beaus. She never married and at some point in her thirties she returned home to recover. Seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind. Worrying too much about things. It's just the shadow of the world they live in, because Jackie O. came and went around the place so that her aunt and cousin aren't evicted. It is a 28-room villa that is worn and worn. But in the film you'll notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you see that it was a big mess. Edie's outfits are very intelligent and creative. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to go naked, but not in the film. Edith was really beautiful and you can still see the shadow of her beauty as she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty in her day and quite attractive at age 56. It was a good film, though not for everyone. When the cat urinates behind Edith's portait, he says "at least someone is doing what he wants"!
