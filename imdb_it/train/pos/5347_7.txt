Another Spanish civil war movie of 1936. This time we are told the story of Carol (adorable played by debutante Clara Lago), a young girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village in New York. It is such an initiatory journey, and soon you will discover the injustices of the human race, their stupid quarrels and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best film from "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober impulse, a beautiful photograph and a beautiful script. Try not to take part in the conflict, it only shows us some facts and lets us decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide which band we are in) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and freshness of the young couple: Clara Lake and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-maintained production. <br /> <br /> My vote: 7/10
