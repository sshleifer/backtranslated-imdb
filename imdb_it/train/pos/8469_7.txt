I generally love these 1930s mystery / police films by Charlie Chan, and this is no exception. However, something seems bad with this film. A belated attempt to switch from the cerebral films of the Moto focused on the intrusion of the plot to a salad ruined by the relief of the comedy that is relieved like aching feet. A typecast joke appears out of nowhere impersonating an awkward Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem to be caught up in providing relief to the comedy. The plot may seem strange or an excuse for us today, but at that time the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but a common occurrence.
