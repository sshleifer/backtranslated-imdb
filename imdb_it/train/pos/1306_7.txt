An unusually direct actioner played by a cast and shot by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as can be expected from a film clearly filmed on a limited budget, but the drama is involving-- it is one of those films that when repeated to nausea on Cinemax 2 or more Max or as they call it, you end up watching the 40 minute blocks when you should go to work. Along with W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", remember that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low budget colleagues, who have a real ability to beat a genre film, when in he's actually interested in the material (ie, not bothering to watch his Shannon Tweed movies with a 3 or a 4 after the title!) Actors who have had too little to do recently (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes ) have really put their place in some of their best roles over the years - like for Grieco, he has the right look, even if his acting is a bit monotonous - it's clear that his character should be self-destructive throughout the film, but Grieco cannot transmit it. I checked IMDB and I see that the writer also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for the director - both minor classics in their rights, but obviously "silly" Roger Cormon type cinema - this is more like some of the best Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-pictures from the 70s - giving you the element of exploitation but at the same time offering a dramatic film - a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane", and the final moments of the comic are a bit disruptive, but a straight-to-video action-well-written action, driven by above-average characters. Small successes like this should not be overlooked when they arrive, which is quite rare (as I was reminded as I tried to sit through a monstrosity of Albert Pyun called "Heatseeker" the other night - this low budget material is not so easy how it looks - but that's another story!)
