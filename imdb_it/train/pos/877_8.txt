Jean-Jacques's career began with his response to a prize question: civilization makes us bad. This intelligent and exciting film supports this argument. In this sense it reproposes a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters are found, and each other, only when they break the rules. This discovery could be true in France; anyway, it's quite romantic.
