I just came out of a preview of this movie. It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that tears came to my face and I wished that I hadn't bought that big coke. There are certainly some periods of calm, but, overall, a lot of fun. The film leaves Steve Carell the chance to shine after stealing the lights of both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their films. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I like that he can be so funny in these comedies and he continues to work in independent films (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should have more work, because he's so talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had incredibly fun moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who just wants to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, do not watch this movie. If you are a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, please, no matter what, even if you think you're one of those "fashionable" parents, don't bring your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your kids go see this movie, but don't watch it with them. It would be incredibly embarrassing for some moments.
