After seeing several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction waiting, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and yet they can only - almost - make it work. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is good! Male actors are quite skilled in their professions. Most of the characters are well designed, with special compliments for the hero and his more than nice side kick. And most of the story lines are acceptable. So what could be wrong? How about female characters and aesthetically perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. <br /> <br /> The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost a good series - in a way that makes the final product look like a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask him, why? <br /> <br /> The episodes all fall into white whenever the female guest star or the recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are absolutely incredible in their roles, and you really don't have to see them to know that they are incapable of their acting assignments. A blind person could say. Listen to them, talk. They offer their dialogue with all the drama and effect of a sixteen year old at the high school ball. Who would believe that these women are scientists, doctors, senators, business executives and doctors? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, if the producers have their choice of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will be? choose - every time? And, of course, the series suffers. Sin!
