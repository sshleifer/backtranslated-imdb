"Pet Sematary" is successful in two main situations. First of all, it's a scary horror movie. Those that are not produced in these days. Second, it is an emotional and intelligent film overall. So, if you're looking for chills, scares, gruesome and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs and macabre effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and really worth seeing for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably, the best adaptation to any of King's novels. The events feel a bit hasty compared to the novel, but this does not mean that this undervalued film is not a Horror / Drama suit. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is known to be very emotional and macabre at the same time. The film captures the same feeling mainly because there is a great development of the character and you can feel the love relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer appiness!) A tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, now it becomes very dark. The film has a sinister feeling from the opening titles, but after Gage was killed the film becomes sad, gray, disturbing. Dealing with the loss of a small child is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and "Pet Sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind the pet semifinal is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but the sadness and despair bring an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. Sadly, the legend becomes reality and little Gage returns from the dead. The previous meeting with the legend of the pet semifinal turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it's something much, much worse. What will happen to the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch "Pet Sematary" to watch one of the most touching and exciting horror films of recent times. You will not regret. The acting is very good even if I didn't dig the actor who played the father. He didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations demanded his despair. But this is just my opinion. Denise Crosby really did a great performance and worked perfectly as the noble and tender mother. Baby Gage was incredible even in its gruesome parts. * * Shivers. Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing film that touches people's deepest fears ... the loss of someone you love, the dead man who returns to life and a feeling of despair. <br /> <br /> Something is for sure ... I don't want to be buried in an animal workshop!
