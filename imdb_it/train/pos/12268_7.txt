Seven young people go to the forest in search of a bear. Because they are all followed and ferociously murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a very fun Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of "The Zero Boys". The film is frenetic pace and there are some scenes of death like throat or ax in the neck. Unfortunately there is not much blood, so grand-guignol fans will be disappointed. However if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity an appearance Mexican horror movies are rather obscure (I've only seen "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this fun slasher. My score: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
