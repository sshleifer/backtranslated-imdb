Of all the British imperialist films such as Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade for example, this film stands out as the cream of the crop. It reflects a time when "the sun never set in the British Empire". Get over it. I won't go into the reason why so many others have expressed the many reasons that make this film fantastic. I visited the Alabama Hills and photographed the passage through which the British marched and remains as it was, unchanged by time and by the invasion by man and vandals. And even though I know it's coming, seeing Din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> Tu Lazarushian- leather Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Even if I fenced and flayed you, <br /> <br /> from the livin 'Gawd that made you, <br /> <br /> You are a better man than me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> I still have veiled eyes at the age of 54 and those who say they are not liars. The range of emotions inside is the mark of a great film. Like the end of another great movie, Of Mice and Men.
