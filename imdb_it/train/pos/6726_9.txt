Once again, Stacy Peralta is first and foremost true to the people who lived through the story. By letting the people involved in the genesis of the Big Wave surf tell us their stories, how it feels and what they thought, one has the feeling of having been there. The film takes you from the fifties to the present day focusing on three primary architects who contribute to the evolution and development of this sport. "Home videos" like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you farther into their world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a pure vision of the participant's athletics and fabulous images of big waves offer you a wide-ranging perspective on this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at.
