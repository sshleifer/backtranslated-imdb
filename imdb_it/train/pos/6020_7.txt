A beautiful new print of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and it looks like it is going well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a complete evaluation of the film. We hope the new print means that a DVD with some interesting "extras" will be released in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when it came out and thought it was boring. This time I was completely amazed and would classify it as an "almost-miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule from Los Angeles in the 1960s, I lived there, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place. Congratulations to production designer Dean Tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> The print I saw lasted 1 hour and 50 minutes. It is forbidden for children under 16 (or 18, I do not remember). I suspect there is a lot of footage restored in this print. SPOILER - I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What appears today seems rather domesticated by current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour in the film. Before hearing extraneous noises such as radio transmissions, etc. Antonioni was very bold in doing so. I remember what was done at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette didn't bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Much of the film about the student revolt seems to me to be a repertoire. One shot has different proportions and is distorted by the large screen. Of course, there is a movie on the scene, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of Frechette's shots flying over the plane. Looks like it really did fly a bit - there's no blue or double screen in some shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to return to see the movie a second time. Highly recommended to all Antonioni fans.
