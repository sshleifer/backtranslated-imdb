I liked this movie. It is another Yash raj film that you know well on the screen, all the characters are always cute or very nice with an exception that you will know will end up being beautiful ... Another rule of the film of Yash raj is that it is hero who heroin; s have only one or none of the parents. Think of all those movies .. MPK Suman had no mom, HMAPK Salman had no parents, and the FINAL rule is that you have a 90% chance of seeing Alock Nath cry ... <br /> <br /> Even the movie it's good. It's a little slow at first, but it keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it makes you smile often enough. The child (the grandson of the hero) is well placed and offers a good covering. The actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get it in real life. this film has no big happy families living in BIG home, that I was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the film. There is no strong message from this film, but it is a good watch. If you are married (combined marriage) the film will remind you of what you went through. And if you're not, it will inform and scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall, a very nice movie. No plots or twists, but a very delicate film, very similar to the classic Bollywood.
