The widowed family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life" which provides advice to families in standard New Jersey and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the eldest, has just obtained a driving license, but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on her schoolmate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie gets a call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his parents' house, he discovers that Marie is the girlfriend of his brother wolf Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Over the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and a delightful movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the beautiful Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is fantastic and it is very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments in this story. The script is wonderful and the performances of talented actors and actresses are extraordinary, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to surprise you with the Burns family reunion. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o and Nossa Namorada" ("I, my brother and our girl")
