I took the opportunity to "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying the value of the first season (Canadian version) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and was immediately captured later. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I rate it as 10 stars here. It's so good. What I liked were the opening and closing themes and, of course, the Stephen J. Cannell logo at the end of each episode, but especially the relationship between the judge and Mark as they worked together to resolve each case. I was so excited that I also bought the second season as a companion, and I enjoyed the same way. If you don't have this excellent disc series, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
