One of the greatest successes of 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama with regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a big star. Haines is patented to the end: brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by all wise and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. No one has worked on this formula like Haines. Extraordinary comedian (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could move from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. It is a total joy in this film as it was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where it repeats the formula. Mary Brian is as good as the girl, Jack Pickford is as good as the sickly roommate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and the co-star of Grady Sutton. This film is known for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for having been John Wayne's film debut as a Yale football player (but I've never seen it). Haines was one of the first five-star box-office starting from this photo until 1932. It is a pity that it was largely forgotten and that most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
