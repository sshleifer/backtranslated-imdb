Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the affable William Haines). The young Peggy arrives in Hollywood in search of celebrities. Cameo's performances show "all the stars in the paradise of MGM" in the famous scene of the commissioner, in addition to a lot of vintage films that make the details for the scholar. Pic captures even for posterity the famous sarcastic imitations of Davies of the best actors of the day (his Swanson is a beauty!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy", she also catches herself when she meets the famous tennis star Marian Davies, looks up and comments, "Ohh, I don't like it!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. History, direction, an authentic charm and a must for all silent members.
