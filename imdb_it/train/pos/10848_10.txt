... heads, hands and feet - a band from the past, just like Strange Fruit. A triple whammy there. Those who professed not to love this film are heartless or under 40, and have not experienced the real thing. Sad for them. This is a small, painfully observed image that is an excellent way to spend an hour or two, and probably won't fade much on the second show. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the fat drummer (in many ways the most delightful figure of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - while the neurotic singer and frontman turn into super performances, and Juliet Aubrey has a beautiful doe eyes to go with a sharp acting like Karen, who tries to hold the band together while they self-destruct in a spectacular way. <br /> <br /> The echoes of Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople gets up before one in all their ridiculous ridicule, and the script is never sloppy for more than a minute. Don't compare it to Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair on all of them. The closest comparison is The Commitments, and it's not a bad thing. And any movie that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I don't remember ever seeing, but the name survives - well, shows that someone on the team knew what it was. <br /> <br /> A little delight, and thanks for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I HAVE ANOTHER - Stiff Little Fingers; a-to-what to say SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... NAILS ten inches someone? (You must see the movie or you have been on the road)
