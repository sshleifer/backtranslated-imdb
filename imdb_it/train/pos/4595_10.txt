The name of Jackie Chan is synonymous with acrobatics. This film will never disappoint you. The best chase scene and the last scene to roll down from the pole is so risky that it is a marvel, if it knows the meaning of fear. This film is very close to the best of Jackie who is PROJECT A. The main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars in which, as in this film, Jackie brings the film entirely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this film made Jackie the greatest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee. The film has nice comic touches as well. What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable side that is in agreement with the typical martial arts action hero. This film was followed by a sequel that was good but rather meek compared to its predecessor.
