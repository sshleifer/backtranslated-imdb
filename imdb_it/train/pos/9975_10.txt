it's not as good as the first movie, but it's a good solid movie and has good chase scenes in the car, on the remake of this movie there's a story that the hero must drive fast while trying to rush to the side of his sick wife , the ending is great just a nice honest movie to look at in my opinion, <br /> <br />
