Perhaps the film itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the mall's struggle was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There were also some memorable stunts, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This film has influenced many other action films and I think that nowadays filmmakers have to learn from this film (as if they could redo the chase scene, I with modern technologies could make it even better). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie funny even when Jackie wasn't fighting. Although I think they could put more fighting scenes in this movie.
