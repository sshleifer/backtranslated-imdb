This would have worked much better if it was made as "Mitchell in Malta". At least then we would have been spared the Joe Don Baker show that ran into an otherwise scenic Mediterranean venue dressed in that ridiculous cowboy outfit ... not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film would not have suffered even from the lack of free police brutality. Oh good. At least Mike and the Bot's comedic comments made this thing as fun as an episode of MST. I can't imagine looking at him alone, anyway.
