Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other while making this film and in later years. Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was already shocked that he had been cast as Nathan Detroit when he wanted to play Skye Masterson) wanted to be the lead singer in the production and didn't want anyone better than he. He told Brando to get lost, so to get back to him Marlon continued to ruin the scene in the diner where Sinatra was eating the cheesecake to continue eating, eating and eating. In recent years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" for the way he spoke.
