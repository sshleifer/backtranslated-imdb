SPOILERS Nowadays many different comedy series have experienced dark independence. In an initial episode of the comic book "Family Guy", the Griffin family finds that their home is an independent nation in the United States of America and history is advancing from there. Back in 1949, however, Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little film about the same idea. <br /> <br /> After a child's joke, the inhabitants of Pimlico discover a small fortune in a treasure. The investigation makes it clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of Burgundy. By withdrawing from London and the rest of Britain, residents of the small street experience the joys and problems of being an independent state. <br /> <br /> Based on a time when rationing was still in progress, this story is brilliantly said and equally inspiring. With performances by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey, the film is well stocked with some of the best actors of their generation. These actors are well helped by a superb script with some sharp lines. Feeling extraordinarily cool, despite being over 50 years old, the story never seems embarrassing and always keeps the audience entertained. <br /> <br /> Ealing Studios was one of the best exporters of British films ever. With films like "Passport to Pimlico" it's not hard to see why. Fun from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth watching.
