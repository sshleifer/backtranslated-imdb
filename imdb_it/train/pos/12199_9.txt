The first mystery is to guess how it was the original film by Welles. This makes this a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and use film science, imagine the beautiful woman who once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you will see and you will see perhaps one of the best mystery movies ever. As the mysteries go, the narrative is quite ordinary: a simple diversion, a jealous husband like a false herring. <br /> <br /> What is rather miraculous is the positioning of Welles' story in an artificial eye that sees a dark, multi-faceted and multi-faceted world. The first real noir, but even darker. It's not an obviously twisted world, unless you think about the camera. What we can see first hand is someone who creates a vocabulary that would later become common. <br /> <br /> For all the celebrations, Kane was a success because of the great drama and its history. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the narrative of the mystery and Shakespeare's self-reference with this eye. Othello and MacBeth have both started in this period and I consider them part of a single vision with this. <br /> <br /> The noir feeling here depends on the idea that people are not responsible for their lives, even a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So, in telling this story, Welles must make the environment a character. Different characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> So we have the famous lighting, the blocks and the angles we know (and since then we have seen countless times). And we have the sets deliberately closed: the park, the yacht, the picnic area, the aquarium, the pier, the courtroom, the Chinese theater and the funhouse. I am sure that what was cut by the barbarians was a lot of "external" narratives that do not deal with the character but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it, among other character environments introduced as suspect. In other words, the manipulation of Black Irish (which we know from notes and a typing scene in the union hall was an aspiring novelist) was neither: a human conspiracy force (the park or the civil version, the courtroom) nor of nature (the picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium). Instead it was a question of whim wanted by the gods for fun. This is obviously a reference to what Welles is doing: putting these people (including himself) through hell on our own whim, an issue highlighted by the Peking Opera set with Welles drugged. And of course leading to fun where the environment is experienced directly with perception. <br /> <br /> More information on self-reference: surely there is a conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be ex-wife. But I believe that there is a strong unconscious comment on his part that taunts the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Surely Welles was so much screwed, and more or less the same way, of his character. And that fuck took the form of the murder of this movie, leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> That poor Rita comes from China and binds everything, the Chinese theater, the rape planned from above, the loss of the woman. Investment in the environment beyond everything.
