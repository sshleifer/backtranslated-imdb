This great film is mainly composed of documentary material currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American director and screenwriter Frank Capra has made these films that recall in a simple and clear way the main points that caused the Second World War and the rise of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every child in the school, indeed, every American should watch them movies today because they are so about. History has been repeated ad infinitum! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis to infiltrate countries through sympathizers and then communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups, are still working to the advantage of these evil groups. <br /> <br /> Sitting down and leaving Hitler already in 1935 aggressive: France, America and England have caused over 50 million deaths. Americans, French and English today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing, although we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties. <br /> <br /> These great films could be too simplistic for World War II history buffs. They do not say the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at that time America was united with them, fighting against Hitler. This film tells the facts and the reasons that led to the terrible war.
