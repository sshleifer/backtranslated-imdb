Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films, the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is all that should be a sequel. He does not trample the fingers of his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend in which it was the first film to live in an extraordinary immortality. <br /> <br /> The Snowy River II man is based on Jim Craig's return to the Snowy River country after a three-year absence. The film subtly tells a story of changes in the nineteenth century, of history, legend and Australian horses. The plot shows a Hollywood touch in lighter shades, an absolutely absent appearance in the first film, yet it blends solely with the distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more lively than the first film, and much more showy, with particular aspects of the previous ones incorporated in the film, yet The Man From Snowy River II has all the essential features of the first film; a sensational cinematography, an extraordinary focus on the Australian plateau, the second most impressive horse sequence ever shot, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland that equals the first in every sense. Geoff Burrowes has done an excellent job with this film, and it is very worthy of recognition, especially regarding the quality of the Australian film industry. The main cast, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy, carry on their parts with the same passion and distinction as the first film. As for the sequels, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience once again.
