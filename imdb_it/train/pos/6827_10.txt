I spent 5 hours drenched in this movie. Nothing I've ever seen comes close to the delicious funk that this movie has left me. It doesn't matter that females have advanced the aging dilemma, human fear goes off the screen for your vision. Personally committed to the ninth grade, the film invests one with a shared feeling undeniable for our lives ". I liked this pussy with the deep wound wounded from the inside. It guarantees a mutually shared dress in the history of human encounters that reaches much more in depth the pain, isolation and distorted visions of oneself and others.The result forgives our lukewarm formation of a bridge far from the muddy mud of dead that we have to meet.The birth in finding real people is a happy search. effort for realism intersects with the dark terrain of our bankrupt culture.
