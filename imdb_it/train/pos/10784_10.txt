Although not in the movie, Andy Griffith plays his best role again in this CBS TV movie. The plot is easy: Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and children spread his ashes like the place he called (Mountains somewhere). Although it will never be seen on TV and will never be published on video, if you have the chance to watch this - TAKE IT.
