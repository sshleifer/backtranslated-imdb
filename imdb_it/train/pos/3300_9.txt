Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the "Trivia" section) on how it came about. It seems that fate conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly wishing to see him complete his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah rides metaphors, poetry and visual eloquence. Consequently the intensity with which emotions come out reaches a dimension that may not be very real but is very effective and leaves an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as his. The other stars of the film, besides her, are Ghulam Mohammed (the musical director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and their cinematography leave you spell. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic of world cinema. It reveals you new levels every time you look at it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and has left us a gift.
