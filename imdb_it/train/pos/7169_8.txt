Generally, "children's" films have an annoying quality that makes it too sugary and unbearable for someone over the age of 13. But then again, this is before Holes hit the scene. Of course, it has the same moments that often give a film for children its quality mentioned above, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the disturbing dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers were more realistic than most films try to portray. What I particularly liked about this film is the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. Emotional power was a little more natural than most can imagine, a bit like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar and redeeming ending). The only downside? Lizards looking for a hockey. Overall, however, an 8/10.
