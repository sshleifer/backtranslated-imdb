Richard Brooks's excellent 1967 film of the Truman novel Capote IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect complement to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance in CAPOTE 2005. They play really well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that weave so well. These two enhance each other. Although several actors play the role of assassins Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks' films is weaker, given that they give him a different name from that of Capote. I would suggest looking at CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It's a powerful experience!
