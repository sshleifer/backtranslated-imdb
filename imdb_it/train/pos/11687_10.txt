My passion for Chris Rock varies with his films, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in that movie. I like it when he is himself and does not hold back, as in Dogma. Well, this is still his best, I didn't expect it to be so beautiful. He left my ass all the time. Chris Rock offers a wonderful sweet story supported by some of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time. I love.
