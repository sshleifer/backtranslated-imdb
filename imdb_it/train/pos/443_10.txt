I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90s when it was released. Room With a View also came out recently. The enchanted April had much more to offer! I found it much more real and earthy, the most believable characters to be 'normal'. At the end of the film I felt the same thing I felt when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, and I wanted the characters to find what they were looking for if it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You have understood that Italy is so far from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent to risk and leave behind everything that is banal and constricting. But in the heat of the spring of April, everyone's lives are loosened and untangled (in line with the Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilt to the satisfaction of all. What a little gem of a movie! Why is it no longer known?
