I saw this last night with low expectations. The reason is that I don't like "made for TV" movies and I rarely liked "cast reunion" movies. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed to like this, so I gave a chance. I'm glad I did it. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward come together as themselves. But, in a sense, "Batman and Robin" were acting like their selves. They were camping and they didn't take themselves, or this movie too seriously. The film begins with them in search of the Batmobile designed by "George Barris", which someone stole before it was auctioned for the home of an orphan. While looking for the car, they also remember the series they did together. This is called flashback. It was well done. The actors who got young for the Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And, for a TV movie, it's got to the core of their actual behavior on and off the screen. Giving this at 9/10, I liked it so much.
