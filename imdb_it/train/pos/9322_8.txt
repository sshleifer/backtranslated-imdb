I'm glad someone made a film about how hard it is to risk your heart for the second time. O third. This film is exactly what it promises to be: beautiful, fun and gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they haven't all been used yet. The cast is perfectly selected even though Scott Wolf doesn't look like a father of an eight-year-old even when he is wearing a suit. So, the sparks are in the right places, the support cast is supporting in a lovely way and although you can probably predict the whole movie, you won't want to change channels. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
