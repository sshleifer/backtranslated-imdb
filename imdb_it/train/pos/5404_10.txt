Anyone who says that pokemon is stupid can die. This film is superb. Even a tear when Celebei died. DON'T SHOUT MUCH! This film is an exciting animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of pokemon, Ash and friends must stop the bad trick of making Celebei the ultimate weapon of evil with his dark ball. Over time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and are continually hunted by game hunters. I like the double battle part and Sam has the Apricorn Pokeball (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) I also liked having the miramax in charge instead of Warner Brothers. Putting the mini movie to the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this film come to life more than ever.
