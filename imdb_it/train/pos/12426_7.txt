David Duchovney creates a role that he should have replicated a bit in Californication: the troubled talent. And it is a role that plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a good criminal and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a disgraced doctor who finds his way into a criminal world is well written. Drug addiction and the desire for the aphosa Jolie mix an intoxicating cocktail. Unfortunately towards the end the story becomes a little weaker and the relationships between the villains and the FBI are confused and hasty as if it had been created only to develop the final scene. But apart from that, a film worth seeing.
