My father was the prison warden (now retired) exposed in this documentary and I grew up in prison life, so maybe my views will be totally different from everyone watching this movie. I will say this, the directors who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and better people. They were brave enough from A) Show yourself and tell this story, B) Join these inmates, minds and hearts, and C) Do all this responsibly. Responsible for their art and, most importantly, responsible for the detainees and the staff of the Luther Luckett Correction Complex. They should be praised endlessly for this work. Taking 170 hours, yes HOURS, of movies and being able to cut and reduce it to a compelling 93 minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and have my utmost respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in circumstances that only a few, very few, were able to see. I was at the prisoner's selection. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts spill out onto the screen. I saw men shouting on television shouting in the chair in front of me and let me tell you, it was a very profound experience. These men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases, yet they have found ways to try to redeem themselves, even if they consider themselves unrecoverable. How many of us have the courage to do it? How many people could do what they did in such a harsh environment? Seeing them react to the film was an experience for which I am eternally grateful, and I will never forget. I thank the men who allowed me to take a look at their lives, I thank my father for making this possible, and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to shed blood, sweat, soul and tears in this project. /> <br /> This film will change everything you think you know about prison life, and the inmates held inside it. 'Oz' is not real, television is not real. 'Shakespeare Behind Bars' is.
