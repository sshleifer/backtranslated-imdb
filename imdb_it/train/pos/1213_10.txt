This film contradicts the first one regarding the origins of Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate film, then it's a great movie. I remember seeing him in the early 1980s (and therefore adapting to his targeted demographic audience), and absolutely loving him much more than the first film (not that I didn't like that too, it's just that it seemed to have a little something extra it). Sure, it's darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so beautiful. And it is also obscure in a more subtle kind of subtlety (which children may not fully understand, but may still be a little scared because of the atmosphere it emanates, and the adults who watch will certainly be faster as I look again now this movie in my mid-twenties) where you basically have a girl who makes a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Take the picture? But simply watching him as a child, sure as I said, he could be a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. In fact, if anything, he gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was that age. I can't say the number of times I pretended that Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, help me capture the Care Bears, try to get me to the dark side, other things like that, etc. So this film was also good for my imagination. And it also has a great emotional depth. I watched him at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Even Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the Dark Heart voice (I've always thought about it and I'll always do it). <br /> <br /> Now it's just a pity that they never made a soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing up without watching the movie, no matter how good. <br /> <br /> "What good is love and care if you can't save it?"
