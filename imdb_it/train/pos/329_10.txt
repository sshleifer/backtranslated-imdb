Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of all. Almost faithful to the original plot - with some minor deviations and omissions, eg the absence of Scylla and Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus disguised in his acting - realistic script and authentic landscapes and costumes contribute to making this a truly memorable masterpiece, not a Hollywood B-flick of sword and sandal. Despite the fact that dialogues and subtitles are completely in Italian, if you are familiar with the plot, you can still understand what is happening and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good text at hand of the odyssey by hand) . At least I did it, and so much so that it inspired me to study the Italian language to appreciate the film even more.
