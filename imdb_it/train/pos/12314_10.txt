Once in a while a movie comes up that raises the bar for any other film of its kind. A film of this caliber will influence many films after its release for years to come. `A Chinese Ghost Story 'falls into this category. It is undoubtedly one of the best horror films made in the 80s; perhaps one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers made a film that appeals to all horror fans. The story is compelling and original. The bad guys are appropriately threatening and scary. The sets are gruesome and atmospheric. There is also some blood and blood to satisfy the fan of the house. But don't let the "horror" label scare you, if you're not a fan of the genre. This film easily adapts to many different categories. <br /> <br /> The writer was able to skillfully blend drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romantic genres into a delightful deluxe cinema pizza. `A Chinese Ghost Story 'is a beautiful epic love story told, thankfully, without the free nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many Hollywood" love stories ". Those sent back by the romantic elements of history can sit and have fun in the fast pace of sword play and "wire". If that wasn't enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate the appetite for comedy. This film offers something for every movie fan. Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark have assembled a truly amazing cast for this film. Leslie Cheung shows that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a fascinating physical comedian. I can't think of an actor other than Cheung who could have played Ling Choi Sin better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is as charming as Lit Su Seen, the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of Cheung's character. His portrait of the title character is really haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the irascible Taoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, this film is very impressive, even by today's standards. The management is superb. I hope that today's Hollywood executives look for talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching rather than fall into the usual MTV video or Pepsi commercial "directors". Cinematography is wonderful. You have to commend any filmmaker who can make a film beautiful when most of its key scenes take place in the middle of the night. The special effects trick is top notch. In fact, most of the creatures' effects in this film wipe out the evil CGI ghoos and goblins that have become common in modern horror movies. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "A Chinese Ghost Story" has generated two worthy sequels, a full-length animated film and countless imitations. None of the films that followed or copied it, however, was able to capture the magic of this classic. This film is required for viewing any horror fan or just for anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
