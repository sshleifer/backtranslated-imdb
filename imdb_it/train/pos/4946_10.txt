Good boy! Morgan Freeman is an actor, who is looking for a character who was chosen to perform before he gets involved. Freeman is a "good" for this film (as if it were for "Driving Miss Daisy"), and not only is it credible, but he has the possibility to change his image to play a character with reserved dignity and fairness. Although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotypes. And it must be said that stereotypes have hindered, or completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget film that, incredibly, was made over a period of just two weeks. It is a film well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The localization manager chose Carson, CA for setting the film, and the position helps establish the tone and timing of the film. The assembly is right for the good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was the "subcontractor" in making Freeman make this film, while the actor was in the middle of film projects. <br /> <br /> There is a good understanding between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialogue between the cast members, who are different and come from different cultures. The film also encourages understanding between people who speak not only two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, customs, beliefs, traditions, principles and values. The film seeks some honesty, and comes at a certain point, to maintain the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> The part of the play is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been out of work for four years. In fact, Freeman is so in demand as a constantly working actor. <br /> <br /> The film offers an adventure of bonding, care, sharing, change and exchange. And, the film's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some things an actor has to face in preparing a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss you are doing a "mental health day" and go see this movie. If you can, bring your significant other or your family with you. I classify the film as 10 out of 10. It is fun, interesting, informative, moving and useful.
