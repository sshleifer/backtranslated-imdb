WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed by the recovery of his precious object, a repeating rifle created by Winchester. The gun continues to change hands, and Stewart stubbornly continues to follow him. This 1950s B & W effort by Anthony Mann is more of a crime film than a traditional western, and cowboys often look more like modern-day gangsters than antiquated cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is directed to a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) whom he could marry. He ends up falling in love with Stewart, but not before being filmed for a while. Winters is the most complex character in a film full of unusual characters. Look at a young Dan Dureyea in the role of a nutcracker and Tony Curtis in a very small role. A horrible mix Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
