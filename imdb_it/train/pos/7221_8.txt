Every time you think you have a handle on Deathtrap, there's another twist. Better to sit back and enjoy the journey on this one. Best known for his screen kiss between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which was unfortunately cut from the TV version I saw), this film has a lot more to recommend. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his latest Broadway comedies are over. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing but sympathetic, both monetary and emotional, this doesn't do much to make Sidney feel better. To add insult to injury, the young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), has just sent Sidney a show to watch. He is Anderson's first, and Sidney can see that the young man is a talented writer. He jokes to his wife that he should invite Anderson, kill him and present the game as his. At first she laughs with him, but when Sidney invites Anderson to dinner, he worries that he can really implement his plan. And his fears could be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant script. There are twists and turns throughout the plot, and they get faster and more furious as you get closer to the end. It's the kind of movie that left you on the edge of the seat from the beginning, and keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> Acting is excellent. Caine gives his usual excellent performance, and exhibits a talent for interpreting cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent rendition to a man who does not have his eyes wide open or innocent as it seems. Cannon's frenzy works well for Myra. And Irene Worth offers a beautiful performance like a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic. <br /> <br /> This is a film with an ending you would never expect, and the repeated guards help to collect the things previously missed visions. An unseen classic that unfortunately is remembered only for a scene that has somehow obscured certain sensitivities at that time - and this is a real shame.
