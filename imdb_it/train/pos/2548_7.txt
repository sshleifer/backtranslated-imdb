Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! This is one of those movies that casual fans will pass and tend not to like so much. It's not an all-around horror movie like the two previous hits from the duo, The Black Cat and The Raven. But it is very worthy of both talents and is a funny movie when it is re-visited. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer, a director who made mostly westerns, but curiously in these last days of the reign of Laemmles at Universal, he found himself stamping this and the last movie of Laemmles horror, Dracula's Daughter. Both are clear and clean fantasies that are very light on the content of the horror, despite the fantastic elements. <br /> <br /> Just as Lugosi broke loose in The Raven, there is much to be said about the fact that Karloff starred in The Invisible Ray. The only aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfactory is that the character of Karloff, Rukh, acts so madly before being poisoned by Radium X, that there really isn't much of a change once it starts to shine. This is very similar to the complaint people have of Jack Nicholson in The Shining - He is basically a fool from the start. There is no real transformation. Me too. In the middle Karloff simply has a further purpose of revenge in his mind. I still liked his performance, just like I did with Lugosi's exaggerated antics in The Raven. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lugosi completely surprises you and gives you a moderate and reflective twist like Rukh's rival in science, Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best jokes in the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to capture Rukh, which I am in line with the horror film writer John Soister - "What if he (Rukh) touches someone?" the inspector asks. Lugosi hesitant reply, in a way that only Lugosi could express, "They die". Just like Lugosi could be so out, it could also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the interactions between Karloff and Lugosi are all very good, because Karloff's crazy insults clash against the cold logic of Lugosi. Karloff would have continued to play similar mad scientists many times, however, one would like Lugosi to play more straight roles like this. He had only one more chance (Ninotchka). <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray is a fun movie and a real surprise for the real Karloff and Lugosi fans. It is one of those films that improves in every vision, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its "stars" and how this story complements the darkest and most horrible combinations they have had. John Fulton's always innovative special effects are fantastic and the supporting actors are all adequate. Frances Drake is as beautiful as she is in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, rarely seen in classic horror movies. The scene at the end when Karloff chases her and she doesn't scream is one of the film's most disturbing moments. A fantastic and fun movie!
