There are good ways to make a film and bad ways and this is the first. This short caper is nothing more than what he gives to the public. It presents a simple story, told very clearly with a series of jokes to keep you going, then it gets better and better. Clooney's cameo is fun and very welcome, but the protagonists, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily make it on their own. Cute and fun, hilariously towards the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
