I enjoyed watching "Sea Hunt" later in the day, I was at school and I went home to do my homework and by 4:30 I would be ready to see "Sea Hunt" and Mike Nelson in his diving adventures. I loved it! He brought you a place not very accessible at that time, under the great blue sea. Pre "Thunderball" or even before Cousteau became common, there was Mike Nelson who stimulated the imagination of children. I would be willing to bet that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show. Even underwater photography has progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated through the vision of this show. Look and have fun !!!
