Fido is a story of the most well-behaved zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. Everything falls apart though, when the young Fido di Timmy, Fido, eats his neighbor. From that moment on, the disaster (well, maybe not the disaster, but to some extent chaos) occurs. Most people treat their zombies fairly, and one of these characters sleeps with his zombie (a very funny part of the movie, if not very disturbing). And we find the loving Fido whatever he can do. This is a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something fun and different. I consider this 8/10. Rated R for zombie-related violence
