The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you must not have seen the original. Unfortunately this is also the biggest drawback. It would have been nice to have included some of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had evolved. Sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the best comedy movies while trying to deal with embarrassing and embarrassing situations, but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original film. Forsyth should be congratulated with a courageous attempt to move the character and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately imperfect and lacks the warmth of the original
