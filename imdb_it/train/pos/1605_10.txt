"Moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. I own that movie on DVD! The film is about a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's angry brother (Danny Aiello) (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also fantastic. Directed by Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent film for everyone to see and laugh. Not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
