"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it is very fun and accessible to many audiences. The original film could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke taking over his Broadway role, but instead he tinkered with the plot, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This remake, which was broadcast on ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script and also includes some original songs used in a national tour that started this film, with Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this film. < br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a very different guy from Dick Van Dyke, but is well chosen as Albert, (before his "Seinfeld" days, he started in the Musical Theater.) Vanessa Williams is perfect for Rose. them is also a great work by Tyne Daly in the role of Mae and Mark Kudisch in the role of Conrad Birdie (a role he played in the national tour). <br /> <br /> However, this film is not without its problems. One of the main responsibilities is Chynna Phillips, who, however attractive, simply looks and seems too old to be a teenager Kim. And George Wendt is a bit bland like his father, a bit throwing away the "kids" number (a member of the original Paul Lynde cast stole the or show with.) <br /> <br /> But all in all, this is a delightful, well-made film that the material deserved.
