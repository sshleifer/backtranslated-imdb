This could be the only film that actually comes close to capturing the essentially non-transformable world of the American university experience of the late 1960s and early 1970s in the film. Go ahead, name another film that also comes close to this: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "The return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but that is a retrospective film about individuals (self-obsessed) rather than a film about a time and a place depicted * in * that time and that place. "Drive, He Said" portrays - with subtlety and nuances where it should, and a quick kick in the shorts where this is the only appropriate way - the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of college sports of great time (especially when there is is a war on), the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like that. <br /> <br /> The entire cast deserves praise (like the director, of course), but a special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as the basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual ... except for that time ... love interest. William Tepper, as the protagonist, also considers a real applause both for the perfect capture of the student-athlete of the period and for the true college basketball in the film (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? Yikes!). <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic of the genre - and the last film that someone currently in 6th grade should write comments ("boring", "repellent" - um, right, sonny, please come back to your Arnold films). Why is this movie not available from imdb?
