I'm frankly surprised how little has been done in the Columbine massacre movie. There is no important documentary, very baffling. Fortunately we are honored by the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY and Gus Van Sant who did equally well ELEFANTE. Two different events of the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there is something ultimately disconcerting and unknowable about the motivations of the two murderers, and what prompted them to take it beyond fantasy actually horrible. ZERO DAY, presumably made up of videotapes made by shooters and found after the event, is absolutely compelling. Even if you know where it is going, you still have hope that it will not "go" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the film is excruciating. The film is fantastic from top to bottom, from director to screenwriter (not very improvised, even if it seems very spontaneous) to the two protagonists and support players. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that has upset me. Okay, so we can't understand why shooters would have done what they did, but surely one of their contributors was their anger. Yet these guys don't seem really angry. They might say some things to indicate that they are, but in reality they didn't convince me that they had SOMETHING inside of them that forced them to kill innocent people. But this still leaves me with the sense of "why ???" that director Coccio wants me to have. However, rent or buy this movie, it will insinuate you and stay with you for a long time. The people of BLAIR WITCH could only WISH for the kind of success these guys had in making a fake documentary.
