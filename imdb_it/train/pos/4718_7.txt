This film was made in Hungary, I think. however, the countryside is beautiful, the people who interpret the peasants are totally fascinating. their riding is fantastic. I had more in the natives, in the country life and as a hero they were trying to hide Brady from the evil Nazis looking for these paratroopers. They have also sacrificed their lives in several cases. the young orphan Brady befriended was a sweet boy. you will marvel at the ride I think, and the action of trying to escape the Nazis. it's funny and comical in some places and very tragic in others. The ladies have handkerchiefs at hand, for in the end you will be devastated. I own it and watched it several times. in other words, not just a one-time hit. he is a custodian ....
