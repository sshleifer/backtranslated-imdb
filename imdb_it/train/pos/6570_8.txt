This film is harmless fun to escape. Something was missing from the recent Tomb Raider movie. I can't wait to get the DVD. How can people give this low score and go see Titanic without a guilty conscience, I don't know. Anything with Karen Kopins in her underwear must evaluate an extra point or two!
