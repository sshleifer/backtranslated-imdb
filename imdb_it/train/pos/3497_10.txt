Another one of those brilliant young people who did everything and dared to make a love film for teenagers (can I really call it that? - it will invoke the devil from its fans) with a small budget but with such taste, sensitivity and deadline. Peter Sollett, you deserve more admiration and respect. Thanks again for demonstrating to the powers in the "sector" that stereotypes can be thrown into the toilet. A location, a handful of rich characters, low budgets, good acting (and even too amateurs), decent lighting: the worshipers of real independent cinema should look more and stop looking ... well ... you know something.
