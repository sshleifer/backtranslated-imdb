I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The plot, although requiring some improvements, was quite good, especially in season 1. Season 2 became more of a strange show and lost DA's original charm. The plot of the first season was more interesting, a light side of the life of the pony Jam while a serious storyline focused on Manticore chasing the X series. I couldn't wait for the new seasons to come, in fact they still are. I hope the FOX guys and the DA production team realize that a lot of ppl is still waiting for DA to return. Even after 2 years of cancellation, DA can make it big if it works properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should face this challenge.
