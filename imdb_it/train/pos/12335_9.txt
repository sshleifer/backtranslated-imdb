Warning: contains a spoiler. Trite plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is fantastic, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are extremely wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, with all her hair in order. Yet the film is so juicy and so full of suspense. More faithful to the book of most films of his era. Throwing Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was equally shocking then - I'm not kidding, guys) was a masterful blow. It's just his usual Joan Fontainey car. As the killers were supposed to, she dies falling "feet ahead across the floor in an empty space".
