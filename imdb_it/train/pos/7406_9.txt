Very different topic covered in this film. A simple and simple description of Chinese local customs, observing the daily operation of a public bath, managed by the old owner and the retarded son, when the eldest son returns home, mistakenly believing that his father is dead. Like every man in the city he makes his daily visit to chat, play, discuss personal matters and get honest advice, in addition to the usual spa-like therapies. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family ties make the eldest son take control, so the public bath operation is not interrupted. And finally, the arrival of modernization to put an end to this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along. The public bathroom must be demolished, making it possible to build a commercial complex.
