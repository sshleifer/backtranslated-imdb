Of course, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you should really see it a second time and your opinion on the film will surely change. The first time you see the movie you see the love story below and you think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think so) it's just annoying and you're sitting there watching the movie thinking, When will this ship be sunk ??? And this too is not so impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but certainly not exceptional. I'm glad DiCaprio didn't win an Oscar for that movie, I mean who do you think it is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? It makes 1 half-good film and will not make a film for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are almost no movies with him. But the worst character in the film is enough in my eyes. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also realized that the director has a lot of talent for putting together such a large film. There is a lesson to be learned about this film: there are too many love stories as it is, directors should not try to add a crumpled novel in every single movie !!! Of a possible 100% I give this film only 71%.
