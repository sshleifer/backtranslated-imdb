This is a film that has everything, the wild hero, the beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with the tragic flaw and a really wonderful robot. The Forbidden Planet has maintained that special magic over the years and does not lose its flavor with repeated visions (although the sex appeal of the youthful Anne Francis helps considerably on that score). <br /> <br /> Fans of the film will recognize the young Leslie Nielsen portrays the beautiful and heroic commander Adams, even though those of us who have become attached to him in comic roles may be a little taken aback by his appearance in a serious role. The distinguished and noble Walter Pidgeon is also a prominent player as the scientist with a secret (Id). Another supporting cast deserves a nod, notably Warren Stevens as a resourceful and intelligent "Doc", and of course the charm of Miss Francis, as noted above. <br /> <br /> This film was a pioneer in the use of electronic music in the 50s, nothing less. The credits call them "tonality", but those of us who have tried to tinker with the first versions of the "Theremin" device will recognize the gloomy and ghostly groans and screams sometimes used in the soundtrack. However, it lends itself to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and hostile world of Krell. <br /> <br /> The special effects are also quite surprising. I remember my fear of a young man waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible monster "Id", and when he finally appears in the scene of a battle, he literally shook me on tiptoe with wonder and amazement. The magic of opaque art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the Krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various mazes and passages, led by the enigmatic Dr. Morbius. <br /> <br /> I remember feeling jealously that Dr. Morbius would have such a beautiful toy in the form of Robby the Robot. Robby's character is quite charming and somehow looks more human than some of the other characters. Viewers of subsequent shows such as Twilight Zone and Lost In Space will recognize Robby's prop recycled in some of these episodes, although I remember he never had the "personality" of the original Robby. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I don't fully understand the intricacies of the plot until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and anger we carry inside, but we have trained ourselves, with the strength of our will, to submerge and control through adherence to the codes of society. Even if the key to the story seems obvious once revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately neglected) by Dr. Morbius until it is underlined by the clear commander Adams, who forces Dr. Morbius to face evil within himself. It still gives me goose bumps when Commander Adams pushes Dr. Morbius down in front of the Krell machine that equips him with a superior intellect, which opened the doors of his subconscious to the power of the Krell machine: "Here it is where it was your mind artificially magnified and still didn't have the power to operate the Great Machine, but your subconscious had been made strong enough. "Zowee! <br /> <br /> Forbidden Planet probably remains my favorite science fiction film of all time, and it remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and for the wonderful visualization and realization on the screen.
