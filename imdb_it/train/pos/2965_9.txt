Most likely one of the most entertaining movies in the world. Material Oscar Trey Parker and Matt Stone are great fun and before seeing this I suggest seeing "South Park" one of the funniest cartoons created. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. Pure stroke of genius. If you don't think it's funny, then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
