The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the chimney sweep role works surprisingly exhilarating. It guarantees some funny situations and stupid antics, especially from Stan Laurel as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also has a subplot with a crazy professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn't sound like a logical mix of textures and inconsistencies, but both lines blend perfectly with the memorable ending. It's still a bit weird but it's still fun, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of the film is amazing. Sam Adams is as good as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield is delightfully exaggerated like the mad professor. <br /> <br /> The film is full of imaginative and hilarious sequences, all quite predictable but becoming hilarious to watch anyway thanks to the way they are all performed. Everything contributes to making "Dirty Work" one of the best shorts by Laurel & Hardy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
