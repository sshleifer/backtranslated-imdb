"Such a long journey" is a well-made film, a good shot and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a mixture of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all the plots and master of none. Moreover, the western public will probably find the esoteric of the Parsee culture, rather obscure, a little too much to have arms around in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.
