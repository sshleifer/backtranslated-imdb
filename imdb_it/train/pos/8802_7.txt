This is a very interesting project that could have been quite brilliant. Collect 11 eminent international directors and each assign 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; every brief exploration of the global reverberations of September 11th. Without using spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach's piece is the flagship, and the Mira Nair short (segment "India"), based on a true story, deserves to be transformed into a full-length feature film. Does one even realize, while watching his short film, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? he is simply a master of the medium, who also has a profound knowledge of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made. Youssef Chahine, in his "Egypt" segment, assumes the Arab position of self-inflicted collective guilt, whose piece could potentially be the most interesting. It fails miserably. Chahine's short is badly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among the others, superior chapters of the film. Despite the qualitative imbalance, I would still give the 7/10 film for concept, if not for the execution.
