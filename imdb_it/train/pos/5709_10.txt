Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and appreciated more often. <br /> <br /> We open in a small quiet French village, scanning the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that looks like a party. After investigating the clamor, two nearby men are told the story of two apparently friendly men who have chosen two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our photo star has his number and his friend. When he asks his friend, he will share half the pasta, if his ticket was the winning number, his friend promptly says no. Indeed, H.E. double hockey stick no! is the way it behaves for this. <br /> <br /> So when our man finds out that he has the winning ticket and that he has been lost, not his fault, he is frantic. Everyone is out for himself, looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor of "The Great Race". Although this is all a flashback, I was stuck all the time and was so upset by every little thing in this all-for-me movie with the money in the bank. Watch Le Million today!
