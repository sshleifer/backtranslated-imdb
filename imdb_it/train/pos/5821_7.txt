I was rather surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a plot ??? OK, when this video came out over ten years ago, I saw it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It has neither a plot nor a central plot. It is a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-lasting videos, all made in a rather intelligent or creative way. Michael Jackson could be considered a monster these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set a trend with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create vividly fun material, incorporating claymation, special effects, live footage and even self-parody (the sequence "Badder"). And for those wondering what Joe Pesci was doing, this video came out a little before it became a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances at the cinema. And, in my opinion, the Smooth Criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else that Michael Jackson did up to that point!
