Some of the posters seem less than grunts because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but clearly does not pretend to be neither. You will seem a long time to find a bigger Rodgers and Hart fan than me, but Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped to the liver, in addition to which they knew Der Bingle and adapted some great songs - Ma Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's Always You, The Day After Forever, etc. - to adapt to his very personal style and here they come out with another umpteenth - and unjustly neglected - ballad, Once And For Always, as well as a couple of cheerful philosophy-lite voices in If you put the tip of your foot on the moon and not do nothing. The fragile plot is not meant to be taken seriously - because otherwise making Merlin a burden when in most, if not all, of the other versions is more a friend / mentor than Arthur - so if you start asking me out loud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and metamorphosis of righteousness in a school bully who will not enjoy much of what is essentially a fun movie. On balance it does what it proposes to do, entertain, so good luck to it.
