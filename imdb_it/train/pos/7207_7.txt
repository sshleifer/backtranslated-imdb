I went to Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while this is something similar to what this film is; I too cannot help thinking that he is only a Sleuth of a poor man. The classic 1972 movie is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of plot, but certainly the case of execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role confirms it. The film is based on a work by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his last explosions, Sidney is at a low level; and this is not helped when playing Deathtrap; written by an amateur who taught, arrives at his front door. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins to hatch his own story; which consists of inviting the amateur scribe, killing him and then passing Deathtrap as his work. <br /> <br /> Despite all his clever twists; Deathtrap falls on a primary element, and these are the characters. The film fails to provide a single nice character, and it is very difficult to take care of the story when no one is rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by acting. Michael Caine offers a good and fun performance as you'd expect, but no one else is proud. Christopher Reeve is clumsy in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only character possibly detestable with a frankly irritating performance. It is therefore fortunate that the story is good; and it's good enough to save the movie. The plot has many twists; some work better than others, but there is always enough to do to ensure that the film remains interesting. Even director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit as the style of the film is another huge advantage. The central location is interesting in its own right, and cinematography is well suited to the film. Overall, I have to admit I liked this movie; but it could have been much, much better.
