When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, in future visions I was given much more than a masterful film. This image has a singular voice that will resonate throughout the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The opening assembly offers a splendid palette that the helmsman JP Sarro uses to affirm his art on this entertainment canvas. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as a brush as he takes us on a journey that wraps the audience in a tremendous action film that goes beyond the traditional format we are used to and plunges deeply into dark themes betrayal, revenge and the importance of the company. This film is the dream of every director within it. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic feat. The script, provided by scribe Tim Sheridan, was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such a presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the final scene (ATTENTION: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!) where Vanessa turns out to be one of the coalitions and always a villain, is written in such a gloomy tone that it is one of the most chilling endings I've ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> On a final note it is obvious that this production has not been recently. <br /> <br /> So many praise must be given to producer Scott Shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I witnessed such a great production with so much direct attention to every little detail. The work of a producer is one of the most difficult in each film and Shipley makes it seem easy. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film combines creative writing, extraordinary production and masterful direction. This is the art of film at its best. When the end of the film arrives, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is revolutionary, a masterpiece and, above all, The Romeo Division is truly art.
