My university professor says that Othello could be Shakespeare's best drama. I don't know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the film. First of all I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and he worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he didn't direct, but he played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare the way British actors can. not that there was a British problem against the American about it. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses he fully deserves to do. In addition to Shakespeare's other tragedies, this is the question of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and show the complicity of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak with jealousy and the fear of losing it to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It's a pretty nice scene at the end of the film but I won't reveal the ending. It is only worth looking at. I think they have changed many lines for 2 hours, but they always change Shakespeare.
