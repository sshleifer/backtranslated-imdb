As another reviewer of IMDB has observed, this film starts a little slow, but it improves considerably as it progresses. Yes, it was published by Roger Corman, and yes, it covers some of the same thematic themes as the much higher budget predecessors such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of his wife's career as a rising blues singer against her husband's loneliness and her almost Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she is absent and the clever use of effects and settings minimums is well done. Using a very limited number of places and characters, and even using water in almost all the scenes as a metaphorical symbol that drowns cleanliness, this film, despite clearly having a tiny budget, reminds me in many ways of the most complete and accomplished More recent scenario, or the French film "SWIMMING POOL" which I think may have freely borrowed some useful ideas from "UP CONTRO AMANDA". With a smaller set of tools, UP CONTRO AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary and fatalistic vision of surrendering to occasional lustful temptations, but it does it better or better than other films in this genre. The twist of the abuse of Amanda's stepfather in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with the other spectators on the unexpected and comprehensive reaction to Amanda's difficult situation that this aspect of the story arouses. The cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
