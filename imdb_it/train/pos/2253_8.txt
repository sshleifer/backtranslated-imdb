I rented this film for my interest in American history, and especially for the strange history of the Mormons. This film tries to make sense of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a great world religion. It focuses first on the problems that the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. Describes the process of Joseph Smith. In the course of that process, Brigham Young stands up to talk about his conversion to Mormonism and his faith in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is assassinated and Young faces his doubts about whether he was chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his serious doubts, he persists and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, while the crops are destroyed by crickets, he still doubts that it was actually chosen - however, a miracle occurs, which cemented his place in history. <br /> <br /> I found the performances in motion, and the story is convincing and interesting. I'd like to know if Mormons believe this is an accurate portrait. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to SSL are not raised. The problem is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people are away from this movie because of its religious subject, but it has an exceptional cast and will keep your interest everywhere.
