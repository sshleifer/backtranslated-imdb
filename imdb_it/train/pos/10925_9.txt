I really like this movie. I can watch it regularly and not tire it out. I suppose that's one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; everyone has a unique kung fu style that is very secretive and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dying master sends the sixth poison, his last student, to try to remedy the wrongs he suspects some of his students have committed. <br /> <br /> How will the last student find the other poisons? How will he know which one of them is bad? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie fantastic. <br /> <br /> We also see the poisons fighting each other in every combination. It's fun to see how their styles combine. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to begin with. There is nothing better than this.
