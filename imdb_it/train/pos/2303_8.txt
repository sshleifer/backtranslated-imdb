THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving drama about the growth that revolves around a peasant family in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a crush on a neighbor of 17 (Jason London) who ends up falling in love with her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters the dynamics of this family forever. The 50s are lovingly evoked here and the script gives you the characters you care about almost immediately. Witherspoon has already begun to show the winning talent of the Oscar that he would have developed in this initial role and London is a fascinating protagonist. Warfield gives a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister who is equally effective. Congratulations to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays the mother of London. I was unexpectedly moved by this silent and touching drama that arouses strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties".
