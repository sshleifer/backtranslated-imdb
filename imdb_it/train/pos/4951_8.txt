In all honesty, if someone had told me that the director of the unfortunate series of Lemony Snicket events, City of Angels, and Caspers would have made a cheap indie film at low cost and that it would have been very nice, I would say that person has to joke Ma that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was really nice. <br /> <br /> "10 Items or Less" has a similar presumption to films like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" or more recently "Once". It involves the chance meeting of two people who, if the serendipity had not put them there, would probably never cross, or if they did, they will not speak to each other. Like those films, "10 Items or Less" focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters understand each other and build on the strengths and weaknesses of others. <br /> <br /> The story involves Morgan Freeman, playing an unnamed actor who goes in search of his role as a grocery store clerk for an outgoing independent film and for things beyond his control, ends up to spend the day with the lady in the 10 objects or less lane played by Paz Vega. He has a rotten marriage and hopes to find a new job as a secretary. Initially, the character of Freeman just needs a ride home. After spending time with her, however, she wants to meet her and maybe offer her some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is simply a setup for these two characters that interact with each other for most of the 80-minute duration of the film. Freeman has fun with his character, as a stranger appears in the lower class world that lives in the character of Vega, Scarlett. Vega, meanwhile, grows up beyond the stubborn archivist upset with the situation of his life in search of moving forward. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of things that really stood out in this movie. First of all, Siberling has probably taken notice of independent cinema to make sure that the relationship is sincere and does not fall into Hollywood's pitfalls. It is a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works, even if the situation itself seems a bit inconceivable. <br /> <br /> I am also impressed with the performances. While Freeman's presence lends credibility to the film from the start, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun that is not usually seen by him. Paz Vega, meanwhile, is preparing for a breakthrough in American cinema in the future. I loved her in Spanglish and she's just as good here as the sturdy, no-frills Scarlet. Towards the end of the film, he successfully transmits the growth of his character. I can't wait to see it in other films. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 Items of Less works best as a piece of a character, well scripted and directed by Brad Siberling. He didn't write much and his film consisted mainly of great Hollywood movies. Yet there is certainly an artist at work here and I am anxious to see if he will take this path again.
