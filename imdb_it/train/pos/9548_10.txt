It's an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Great work by the Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to focus on the screen. Generally, most Turkish films are not enough, but GEN has the best shots to say "perfect". And even the transition parts are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a big topic that affects everyone. Especially, a woman, who wants to be a psychoanalyst in a sanatorium, has a mother who is a usual madness. Main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you need to do is combine all the suggestions. <br /> <br /> There is an aggressive part of Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar. This performance can be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll feel confused"
