While "Breakfast of Champions" by Alan Rudolph runs in theaters with little fanfare and a lot of derision makes me think of 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" was released. Now that all the talk about Kurt Vonnegut is "immovable", it is surprising that he has obtained two superb kinematic treatments (the other is "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is certainly one of the most underrated films of the decade and I can't understand why. It's brilliant! It remains almost entirely faithful to the book of Vonnegut (without being made up or too literary) and adds to it a poem that is purely cinematographic. How many film adaptations of the work of any author can affirm it? Does Vonnegut himself stage a cameo towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better recognition than that? Not only is it a beautiful film, it is a well acted, written and directed film and is among my choices for the first five American films of the 90s. It is a funeral, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be overlooked. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see "Mother Night" - not even familiar with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as sometimes happens in "Slaughterhouse Five"). It's a powerful and touching piece of cinema.
