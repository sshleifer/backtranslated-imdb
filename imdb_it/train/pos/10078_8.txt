It is a story that could have taken place everywhere, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer who captures the attention of the famous star of the opera and the friendship that derives from it. The elderly entertainer finds / buys a male child to pass his art. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their demanding but free life along the river. Traveling in the city, he performs and has a certain degree of notoriety. Despite the times and the influences, man is good and kind. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances are first-rate, especially Xu Zhu, who plays the street artist. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and decidedly strong, and bears obvious prejudices well. The two protagonists, together with the support of the kind opera singer, Master Liang (an interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the remote similarities of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); yet this film cannot easily stand alone, any resemblance is at its best. <br /> <br /> My only skill with the KING OF MASKS is the ending. He was weak, banal and almost as thin as a mallet. The audience was already wrapped in history, what was the pointless manipulation needed? What a pity. Bring a good film here, only to surrender to an emotional path (and banal) of the genre. Frankly he made this film good, instead of the classic, it should have been. Apart from that, the KING OF MASKS still deserves a lot of time. I was happy to see that the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films. Highly recommended.
