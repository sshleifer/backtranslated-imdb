I don't know why some people criticize this show so much. <br /> <br /> It's a great and fun show - it's probably not the right material for the mainstream in prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are fun, and all in all the same can be seen in most of the plays. The supporting characters are absolutely funny. The patterns of the individual episodes and the frequent jibs of Siegfried and Roy are only just above average, but always so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> This the show was worth the 8 pounds I paid for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
