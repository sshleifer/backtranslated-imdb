Although I really liked Jim Carrey's latest "series" performances ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I always thought his true genius resided in physical comedy. This does not mean that he is a fantastic and talented actor: to those bozos of the Academy Awards he seems not to like it so much, he has never had a (really deserved) nomination or award. Well, any "institution" that names a titanic bore as "Titanic" for 11 Oscars should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Accessed with the review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, the most beautiful, the best played, the funniest movie from "The Nightmare before Christmas". Both films look very similar, with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their main actors like villains (one higher than the other), both have a strong moral lesson, and both are really fun. <br /> <br /> That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoony, so unreal, that he never interferes with the film. It can be fun, it can be a sad soul, it can be angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world, where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, laughs, cries and finally saves Christmas. I loved this movie and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those movies that you'll really enjoy in 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.
