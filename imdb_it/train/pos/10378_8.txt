This movie has an hour of fun and has really fun moments. I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny. They seemed the most engaging and amusing characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his not so good cousin), and the police woman and the blonde biker woman offer some delicious eye treats. I must say that I saw amazing similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My favorite part was the brothel scene, I loved it. Overall, I liked the movie and will get a score of 8. The penalty however, disappointed me. It was a frill on the side, rather than the appropriate burst of laces. <br /> <br /> I'm obviously kidding. :)
