I'm not aware of "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel? I really don't know), but I must admit that, having heard of an agent / hero movie, I was expecting something different, compared to that that I actually got. <br /> <br /> While it was surprising to observe this at the beginning, it was nice to watch this move. You could never really tell where it would go (some twists and turns are predictable, but in general, you can never really tell, if it ends up going). A more than stellar performance by the protagonist and a really good support cast, make this a fun watch. Not as full of action as some might hope or expect for a film like this, but a really good mix.
