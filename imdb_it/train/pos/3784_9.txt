One of the most underrated films I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. And Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this film: first, see a stupid dialogue, an unlikely plot, a youthful idea. OR ... you see superbly minimized idiots who still find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. Launch a Bruce Willis or an Arnold Schwarzeneggar in this plot and it becomes a great hit movie. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity, only that they are Bill and Ted. This is a fence that is difficult to balance, but when you watch the film not as an extravagant comedy, but as an adventure that involves two guys who have nothing to do in an adventure, it becomes much more.
