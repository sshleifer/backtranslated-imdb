Let me start by saying that I have never reviewed a film on IMDb before; however, I am in the video biz myself. And coming from that perceptive; I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this film is what a short film should be. It has a very beautiful story and another thing I love- (an even better ending). The opening was very well done, I loved the videos chosen for this and how it was modified. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W, but the way this film uses the effect it produces. And with any movie, that's all that matters. The film flow works perfectly and the editing was done very well. On the technical side of things (which I am normally working on) everything is also very well done. There is no important technology. stuff to report. The only difference I have is that the credits are a bit odd. This is probably due to a rendering problem. I would also like to say that I would have preferred to see more love scenes, but I am a boy (so you can attribute this to a male factor). <br /> <br /> So overall I consider it a 9/10. It is worth looking at whether fans of Indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
