The sopranos was probably the last best show in the 90s. It's sad that it's over, it was the best show on HBO except on TV, not everything was written for you for as long as you had to think, it was great. the cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and has played his character in an excellent way, as have others. Each character had flaws that made him so real and allowed viewers to connect with them and that's one of the reasons he lasted so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take many different things can be interpreted by the final id as thinking that Tony is not dead but lawn came in and sat with them and that the blackout was just for suspense. Tony will have to go to trial and deal with it, I hope he's not dead, that's how I feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
