In 1978 a phenomenon began. John Carpenter's release of "Halloween" made sure people lined up to see the evil of Michael Meyers. Critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated and became one of the greatest films in film history. <br /> <br /> storyline: 15 years after the murder, four friends (all females) are babysitters (and have it with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to persecute these people. He kills 3 of them in silence and subtlety. He doesn't talk. Walk slowly. He hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one of his friends escapes after being rescued by Dr. Loomis (Michael's pursuer and doctor) <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Halloween it works so well. Simplicity. We don't know where Michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he scares us. These are the only reasons we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the film and directed. It builds unbearable tensions throughout history, and scares so much that sometimes we can't look. And the climax is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> Like horror, this is essential. It's terrifying and well acted. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. A force that cannot be denied. <br /> <br /> The sequels have focused too much on Michael and his "story". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this thing is a masterpiece.
