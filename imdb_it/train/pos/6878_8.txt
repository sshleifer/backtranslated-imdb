At 35, Groove Tube looks a lot like current TV! Special niche networks (sports for nudes), a TV show about drug dealers called Dealers (wing Weeds, and even before the 1978 Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke), strange beer advertisements (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls), dirty clown for children, Koko (nuances of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase doing slap humor (a violent duo of barber voices) a year before his debut in 1975 on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that gave Groove Tube an initial X-rating, I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking about dancing in hippy hippies ---- For sketch-style films like , see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and Firesign Theater's Everything You Know is wrong.
