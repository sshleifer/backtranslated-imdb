Steve Carell is a person you can relate (in a kind) to Dan in real life, a film I expected you didn't like, but I liked it in the end. Not that the film is as fun as a laugh, it's just that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not what The Office fans expect to see from him, but you know what, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell plays Dan Burns, a widowed father whose daughters he doesn't like very much. One weekend, he and his daughters come down to see his family. While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls in love with a woman. When he returns home, he discovers that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes, I found a little incredible. Is the Burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a lot of other familiar things? I strongly doubt it. I don't know any family like that. Does this prevent me from giving a thumb up? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
