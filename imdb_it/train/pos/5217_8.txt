I took this movie late at night on cable, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this film is no longer known, because the subject is very disturbing. But if you manage the issue of sexual abuse, it's a well-acted, suspenseful and very interesting film. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good. And even if the topic is not for the faint of heart, the film does not lend itself to being brutal (such as 8 mm). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who loves serial killer and suspense movies.
