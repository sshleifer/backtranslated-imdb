**Warning! Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short film is one of two parts that exposes the short part of "The Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix was born. Since we already know the story, the plot itself is not a surprise; and the short is not as much fun as it is informative. But this is how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. Images are better than average, and generally cold colors help the purpose of the short. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems. The violence of the story is a bit gratuitous and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (scenes from the United Nations), diminishes the direct narrative of the short. Furthermore, it must be seen with the second part to be completed. <br /> <br /> The concept of Animatrix is ​​brilliant and, despite some problems, this short still fulfills its purpose. It would not have been suitable for the original film in style, content or flow. This is the perfect method to reveal the story. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: good information. He could have said it a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
