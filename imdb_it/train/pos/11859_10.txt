On MTV cribs all athletes and shots call the classic Scarface out of their DVD collection. This could give you the idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not Scarface's point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge in search of a new way of life. Get in touch with the mob group and become a known drug lord. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Greet my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of the Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This is part of my first 10 favorite movies. I would classify it *** 1/2 (on ****). Definitely a movie you need to see. PHENOMENAL.
