The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues (those theatrical representations, usually musical, which often went on in the biggest cinemas in the past) must deal with dishonest competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers and amateur talent his dream of making his mark on FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> While resembling very much the other Warner musical specters, especially the GOLDDIGGER films, this film had a special attraction that none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. It's a marvel, loose and slender, as agile as any cat - a creature that actually mimics a few times during the film. Cagney attracts the attention of spectators and never gives up, fueling the rapid-fire dialogue and the plot with its charisma and lively charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast gives its best. Joan Blondell is perfect as the blonde secretary with a big heart, infatuated with Cagney (big quirk: why didn't she give a musical number?). Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler once again play the lovers on stage and outside; the fact that her singing and acting skills are a little thin are compensated for by her way of dancing; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unusual position as a male protagonist. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert are great fun as brothers-in-law, both intriguing to fool Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly marks as the rich wife of Kibbee, a woman devoted to her beautiful pupils. Frank McHugh's intriguing choreographer is a talent for Cagney's ingenuity. Herman Bing is hilarious in his small scene as a musical arranger. Mavens will see little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Busby Berkeley, the impassive choreographer. His terpsichorean packs, scattered throughout the decade of the 1930s, were a supreme example of the cinematic evasion that the audience of the Depression wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were intended, as part of the plot, as theatrical productions. But no theater could ever contain these products of the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the kind of entertainment made possible only by the camera. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical offerings generally have one or two different approaches, or a story (often quite bizarre) told with songs and dances; or fantastic numbers with a geometric design, beautiful eyes, with abundant chorus girls, a camera in the head and a romantic melody. In a spasm of outr√© extravagance, FOOTLIGHT PARADE culminates with three Berkeley masterpieces: "Honeymoon Hotel" and its pre-production code that tell of a couple's wedding night; `By A Waterfall '- dozens of uncoated females, splashes, floats and dives in perfect patterns and designs (take a close look and see how synchronous effects have been achieved); and finally, `Shanghai Lil '- an adequate tribute to the talents of Cagney and Berkeley.
