This is one of the strangest films I've seen recently. This is because it looks less like a film and more like an experimental film. Kurasawa's experiment consisted of taking a variety of individuals living in a landfill and weaving their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally hard lives. Not all episodes are depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely the tone. Let's see, ... we have a case of incest / rape, attempted murder, wife exchange, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a boy after eating contaminated fish, a man with severe depression (he never talks during the film and looks very scary ), a desperate dreamer who would be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a driver of a street car and spends all his waking moments "driving" his street car among the garbage piles, a married man with a shrewish total (I think I liked his character even less than the incestuous rapist!), etc. etc. In fact, it's depressing enough to almost look like an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan, as Bergman made MANY films that tended to face mental illness and life's despair. Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself ?! So, did I like it? No. It wasn't a fun experience. But it was a very well done film that definitely caught my attention and, therefore, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was like watching a train wreck - you don't want to see all the carnage but you can't help but look! Of all the cartoons, I think the older man who tended to look out everyone and didn't really seem to fit (he was too well adapted and wise to live in a landfill) wanted to represent Kurasawa himself. Could be. I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a variety of Kurasawa movies and you have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this a watch. However, DO NOT make this your first experience by watching his films - it is certain that he will scare many spectators!
