until HBO started running it again this month. I remember laughing out loud in the theater in 1991, and now back in my living room. If I see that it's on, I have to watch it. There is no question. This is much more fun for me than other more popular parodies like Airplane! (which I really like, by the way). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "Sudden Speech! The Last Symptoms of Brain Fever! Could Blow You At Any Time!" put me to the limit. And Whoopie Goldberg wasn't as fun as "Jumpin 'Jack Flash". Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. all have superb performances as expected. I started giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of film that it should be, there is not one thing I would change or improve. So that's it. I have to do it on DVD, that's all there is to it.
