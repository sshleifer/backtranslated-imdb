A very underrated black comedy, the most beautiful of a series of great guignol films to follow "Baby Jane". Reynolds and Winters are mothers of convicted young murderers (a nod to "Compulsion") who escape to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for aspiring filmmakers, a bunch of hilarious kids frequented by horrible stage moms. Debbie, with her blonde wig ("I'm a Harlow, you're more of a Marion Davies," she tells Winters) leads the boys to their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. It also makes a deliciously fun tango and, above all, offers exceptional performance, unlike anything you've done before. The atmosphere is a nice mix of comics and scary. It looks wonderful with great details from the period (1930s). So many good shots in Hollywood and the terrifying movie. Michael MacLiammoir has a ball as coach of the drama: "Hamilton Starr", purrs, "two but nonetheless prophetic". Watch it and love it.
