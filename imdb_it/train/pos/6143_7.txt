He never saw this 1971 film and was very amused by this great production created by Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played an outstanding role as a woman who had attended a witch course and was an apprentice who was starting to fly on a broom and had many difficulties taking off. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine lost his final exams to become an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold this sorcery course to Eglantine and tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for his madness and that is to prevent the Nazis from escaping from England. Great family entertainment and today we need more films like this.
