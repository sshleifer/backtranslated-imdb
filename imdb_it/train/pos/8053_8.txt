This is one of Sammo's great comedy films. This is not a parody of entering the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates it in a bizarre way for a man of his size. Nominal history of how his fights continue to cause trouble to his loved ones - so fight. Oh, the fights. Good and fast-paced high-impact scenes (the white guy who plays a boxer looks really hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable piece of this film was purely unintentional. There is a guy looking for Jim Kelly (one of three experts hired to eliminate Sammo), but he was a blackface Chinese guy with an afro wig. Come on, didn't they have real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen enough "fake" Chinese as "infernal" in old American movies. <br /> <br /> This is one for any fan of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
