This movie is a lot of fun. Actors really make the film far away. Without revealing the plot, I would describe it as a new promise from Princess Bride that should stand the test of time. In this film you can see a completely different side of Robert De Niro! (Worth the admission price just for that!) All the elements are from adventure to romance, and a well-placed comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will appreciate it. (My parents did too!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for a little getaway. <br /> <br /> Deserves an A. (I hope it goes well at the box office)
