This story is familiar in Tom and Jerry's feature films, especially in the 1940s, with the only difference that two cats instead of one are threatened with eviction if they don't catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed friend ("Butch?") Who lives at home with him, so this really upsets "Mammy Two Shoes" that he can't believe he has a mouse despite TWO cats at home. <br /> <br /> However, what Jerry captures can stay while the other does the boot, so the competition is open! <br /> <br /> Even though it's a familiar territory, I still liked it because the cartoon had enough original gags to make it fun. Not only were cats competing with both, but also Jerry in the equation, so there were enough gags to recommend for sure if you're a Tom & Jerry fan.
