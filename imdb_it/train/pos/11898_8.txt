This film is a perfect portrait of The Nutcracker; the dance is wonderful, the scenery in the background is excellent, and I LOVED THAT FLOATING BED. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I particularly loved Marzipan, the tutu was lovely. The special effects were very well made (for example the tree, the bed, etc.), and I liked rats enough. I love how they didn't make them scary, but cute and huggable. Except the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you are a completely male person, you will not like this, but this is a very nice film that is good for all ages - just not all testosterone levels. <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First of all, why did they have to put Sugar Plum Fairy's partner in those terrible tights? It would barely make a difference if he were naked! And secondly ... why on the EARTH did they have to create Culkin's PINK dress?
