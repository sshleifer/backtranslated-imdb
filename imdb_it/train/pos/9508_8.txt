In a poor village in Mexico, the colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola is still saddened by the death of their son Augustin some time ago. The colonel expected his retirement as a fighter in a war against the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old struggle. Without having any possession or money, but a valuable gamecock, they struggle to survive with the expectation of the letter of recognition from the government, recognizing the law and paying the pension late. This slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of most elderly pensioners in third world countries. In Brazil, most pensioners have to survive for around US $ 80.00 a month. The colonel's debts in history were made to pay a graveyard for his son, otherwise he would have been buried as a poor man. Exceptional cast performance, in a very sad story that is reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Não se Escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
