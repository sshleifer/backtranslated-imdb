Before Nicholas Cage was a great action star, he was a great actor. This less known film is the place where Cage offers one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget, almost unknown film, but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I found out as he walked down the corridor of the video store and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (who is also good at the movie) appear together. Go get this, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
