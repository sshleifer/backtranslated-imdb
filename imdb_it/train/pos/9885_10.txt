The young Erendira and her tyrannical grandmother offer a great fantasy from the new world. This interpretation by Gabriel Garcia Marquez "La incréible y triste historia da la cándida Eréndira, ..." cannot rub the purists of Marquez in the right way even if the story remains intact and still carries all the power of work. The strength of this film is in its acting especially Papas as a grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez's novices will appreciate this film for its true and spirited Witt brand.
