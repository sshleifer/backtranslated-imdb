Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your leading nonconformist cop who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he gets (38 and counting), he never stops chasing the bad guys. <Br /> <br /> When a new American tank dubbed "Thunderblast" is pushed across the Mexican border, it is plagued by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Ren√© Enriquez) and Libyan colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva) , who sided with the bad Russians. The army personnel involved are being held captive, including chief Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who appears to be McBain's former girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have the physical presence to say, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate protagonist for a film of this type, but it is an explosion like a self-confident guy who is fast with the jokes. Fluegel is a great female protagonist; not only does she look incredibly sexy, but she is also a beautiful sexy girl. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and the always welcome William Smith (as Russian major) are a lousy scum in the classic tradition of the action film. The supporting cast is rather full of characteristic and reliable actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman provides the script, based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray. It is the kind of script in which we only know that writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know that their material is absurd and poor, and they enjoy throwing away credibility from the window. Steve Carver, veteran action director, keeps him on the move and offers a respectable amount of shots, explosions and general chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind turning off their brains from time to time and simply enjoying a wide range of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
