The joke between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the culminating point of this mysterious murder, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. Powell is probably the gentlest detective of the 1930s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a succession of small tinkling bells. They are extremely fun to watch, so take the impudence of the plot with a pinch of salt and enjoy watching it unfold. Eric Blore also has some comic roles as Powell's butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM included a clause allowing him to refuse to be loaned to another firm, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and liked the script, so he accepted the assignment with enthusiasm . They had worked together in two Paramount films of 1929, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both from the Philo Vance series.
