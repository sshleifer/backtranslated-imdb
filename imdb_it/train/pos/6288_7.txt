GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, elegant and brilliant action film with a high octane power and a lot of fantastic cars. If you are a spectator interested in cars, this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), deserves to be seen only to peek your eyes on shiny vehicles. Although the film conceals a smell of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a fairly successful summer thrill. <br /> <br /> The film features the participation of Giovanni Ribisi ("La Mod Squad") a young swindler named Kip Raines, who, as soon as the film opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars at the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened because of this, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty machines - specified by model, color, year and make-in just four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the robbery. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy but feisty retired scam who knows Memphis through her previous business, a man named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), the wise old man Otto Halliwell ( Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Contributing to the tension and tension of the film is a subplot involving two police investigators, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew I'm good and keep a closer eye on them. <br /> <br /> There isn't much time for character development here; the public gets to know these people with their harsh lifestyle and takes on challenging personalities through the film's elegant and core atmosphere. To make things even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. I'm not saying, I think vulgarity and vulgarity are necessary to make thrillers vibrate; Actually I honor the director's decision to support an extreme vulgar language in a film that could easily have obtained an R-rating. However, I believe in a film like "Gone in 60 Seconds", to strongly develop the lighting of the character, the dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the highest level, perfectly cast interpreters responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's squalid appearance is entirely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously robust and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide convincing secondary roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates the style of the story and the motivations of the character, sets a frantic theme of action, but lacks depth and the introduction of strong characters. In the second act we come across some other problem: history wastes time in most of this segment, without ever really building for the third act. While the central part of the film takes up a lot of time, and a sex scene offers a plot in the middle of the field, not much happens. The third act is practically a pure rush of adrenaline that contains a furious excitement from wall to wall and one of the most intense sequences of car chases ever turned. <br /> <br /> The "Gone in 60 Seconds" soundtrack contributes to the inspiring action scenes. These are scenes like car chases that make this movie work despite several destructive errors. Dominic Sena, whose career consisted mainly of directing commercials, has a captivating style and a determined "Gone in 60 Seconds" attitude that will guarantee the audience two hours of commotion, excitement and excitement, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
