The Matador is a witty, dark melodrama, full of humor and suspense that rises above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and sincere performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and the always reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role here as he plays Jack Nicholson's gay in As Good As It Gets. A great advantage also goes to writing. Brosnan creates an intelligent and occasionally very ugly dialogue and the slow friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it will go next. <br /> <br /> The fine artistic touches of the director such as the good use of music, intelligent editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography sometimes have a nice tone for the film and for a long time you don't know how to label the film. But it is also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat.
