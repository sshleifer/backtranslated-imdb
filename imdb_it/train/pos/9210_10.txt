I feel this is one of the best movies I've seen, I'm an old male and I love most westerns. I love movies based in part at least on facts, if I'm not mistaken this is such a film. I also like revenge-type movies, which also qualifies me in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the film were the opening scene with the lash and barn scene. I heard that the corral beat scene was a bit excessive, but it didn't affect the way I feel about the complete movie. I saw what I think is the continuation of this film in an episode of gunpowder. I liked that too. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I'll watch it again. I also heard the romantic parts of this film well interpreted. I thought he was so out of character that Randy Travis played a villain, but I always like acting.
