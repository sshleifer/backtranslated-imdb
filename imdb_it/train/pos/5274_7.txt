Yes, I loved this movie when I was a child. When I was growing up I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was worn out. <br /> <br /> My family received a VHS copy of this film when we purchased a new VHS system. At first, my mother wasn't sure it was a movie for a 10-year-old, but because we had just bought a new VHS system, she let me watch. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is every little dream child ?? The film contains a formidable setting, big muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, big evil monsters and jokes that you only get when you get older. So, a couple of days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first I was bored, then I started thinking about how much I loved this movie when I was a child and I kept watching. Yes, the experience was not exceptional as I remembered ?? The acting is pretty ugly, the plot is pretty ugly, the jokes weren't fun anymore, but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Although the cinematic experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. Do you know about the good old days ??
