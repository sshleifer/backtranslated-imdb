Goebbels' motivation to back out has not been explored. In the aftermath of Stalingrad the Reich had decided to go to "total war". This is indicated in the film. Part of that was using women in the war effort, which Germany had never done before. A massacre of SS women would have faced Goebbels with a huge public relations disaster. His preference was to make the problem disappear as quietly as possible, based on the fact that Jewish men could always be gathered later. I understand that the majority survived the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that the Berlin "Redhead" had never been very enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be handled with caution. Once again a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre support they had in their capital. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to note that most SS uniforms showed patches indicating that the men they wore were not of German nationality, but were from German origins in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
