I saw this film at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (as Mr. Wood did) it's really one of the worst movies you'll see. And this is beautiful. I Woke Up Early The Day I Died's big joke is that he doesn't even try to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zane is absolutely excellent. See, this is either high art ... or little junk. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
