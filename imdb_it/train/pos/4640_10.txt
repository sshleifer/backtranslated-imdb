It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I saw the prime minister in Tel-Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war started ...) This problem in communication between people, which because of wars, I have been interested for a long time, and it doesn't matter who - boys and girls, straight and gay, Jews and Arabs ... I saw the bubble 3 times already, and it still surprises and excites me - each character reminds me of one people I know, and the difference between them, like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw her was with my friend, who is a Christian Arab and it was Israel's independence day ( the most symbolic I could! how ironic) and ... in the end he exclaimed !!! - if it has been touched and is not embarrassed - everyone will be touched by The Bubble!
