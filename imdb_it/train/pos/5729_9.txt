This is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of Lynch's artistic crowd. They tend to try to write it as a sort of meaningless, crude, sideways project by Lynch. Thus Lynch is passing gas among his true pieces of film art. Well, it could be a fart, but it's one of those intriguing farts that let you slip away and I'm embarrassed to admit you like it. <br /> <br /> Distinguished Dumbland beyond this is art. What can you do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you took it seriously, you would go crazy. You hook, smell, taste, feel your agonies, your stupid unreason and then express it by whatever means you choose. That is called art and art is not stupid. But it's Dumbland.
