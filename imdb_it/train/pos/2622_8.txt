Everyone, my name might seem strange, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> In any case, I've never seen anything like it before, so it was crazy! Of course it's a good thing. It's a humorously interesting film and my absolute favorite thing is the way they weave other things into one! Like the small chicken, the fish that pretends to be King Kong and Runt the pig that says "The beauty that killed the beast", the War of the Worlds scene and more. The Walt Disney company has NOT lost its touch, maybe not for that. Also, as they did as if they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. Like in the original lion king, weren't Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar? In this film, I'm not! they were fighting hyenas behind the scenes. What's more, the reason Pumbaa is not so confident is because he was turned away from other animals and also, they are just Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone realize that only Timonn's story was told, while the pumbaa only had flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But apart from that, IT'S GREAT!
