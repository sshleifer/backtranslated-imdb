In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as a guest. There are many reasons why I said it. Although Hal Sparks was a discreet guest, sometimes I wish Greg Kinnear had not left. If you ask me, it seems that no one is anymore with a TV show all along his run. Still, I enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people who move the celebrities. If you ask me, it was really fun. Before concluding, I must say that I miss this show. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all fans of sketched shows. You'll really like it.
