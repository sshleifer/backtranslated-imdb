"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> with: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn <br /> <br /> MPAA rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some languages) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity these days is making a biographical film about his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very elegant right now. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest of these DVD releases. It features Gretchen Mol as the most famous pin-up model in the world, Bettie Page and was mainly shot in black and white with some color extracts. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland", however, this film will not be one of those to be held at the Oscar this year. This film lacks the emotional resonance shown in other biographical films and most of the most dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are completely ignored or just suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is an extremely fun and rewarding film, a solid work of cinema. This film focuses more on Page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. It is shot with fervor and attention and the direction of Mary Harron captures the look of the time period as most filmmakers only dream of. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know it as an icon or a simple porn star, you know it. She is a woman who has had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than she thought appropriate at that particular time. Now, most people know her as one of the first American sex symbols - a legend for many models, especially those from Playboy and other adult magazines. She lived in a time when showing just an inch of meat under rubbish could cause someone to be arrested and Page's bondage-style photos were the right thing to push the American public into turmoil. In fact, the photos have launched an investigation into the senate to all effects on common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn. <br /> <br /> The performances of "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol. His interpretation of Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that many people were skeptical when it was announced for the role. His name is not what I immediately think of when I think of great shows. Now it will. He completely accepted the role and attracted me with his vulnerable yet engaging performance. David Strathairn is a veteran of last year's "Good Night and Good Luck", in which he held one of the best performances of 2005. Here, he still gives another good performance, even if it is slightly underutilized. I was shocked at how limited his screen time was, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only performance I saw from Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). While most people ignored the film, I found it to be a horror movie, if not entirely superficial, and I also always thought that Taylor was as credible as emotionally upset Nell. Here, Taylor offers another credible performance. It gives a very subdued performance and offers the perfect performance to compliment that of Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After all has been said and done, I realized that "The Notorious Bettie Page" cannot be compared to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is incomparable for these because it tells the story of a woman and her career, from beginning to end. His personal life is implicitly implicit, but it is really his impact on the world that becomes the highest point. We watch the film knowing that Page will end up discovering everything and we know the impact its decisions will have, but we rarely get the impact they will have on his personal life. She is a woman who has never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. After all, she was an adult model who became a Christian missionary. This film does not dramatize anything. He could have included fictitious moments of sobbing sobs and begging God to forgive her. He could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of his past, yet not so. "The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and this is something rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it's quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: "Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing film with an absolutely fantastic photograph. <br /> <br /> General Evaluation: 9/10 (A)
