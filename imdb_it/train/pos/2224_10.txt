A female executioner (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has the fun task of satisfying all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their creator. And what a way to go. Fortunately this film is not real, or we would have many more people in this world on death row. <br /> <br /> Start very slowly. Poor light and bad acting, like most films (B). Improve while moving. And it ends with a bang. <br /> <br /> I would say that he is very tall in the low-cost, very sexy films of the 90s. It is a must see once the children are away or in bed.
