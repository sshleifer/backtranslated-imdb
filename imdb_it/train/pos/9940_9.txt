This animation TV series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology but they will never say it. <br /> <br /> I really think this is the best part of this flow of "educational cartons". Remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and of course: organs. <br /> <br /> In the same stream, you will find: "The était une fois l 'homme' linking human history from the big bang to the 20th century. There is also" L'était une fois l'espace " (regarding space and its exploration) but that is more a fiction than a description of reality because it takes place in the future.
