This film stands out above the vast majority of romantic movie comedies. It's practically flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is captivating and delicious! <br /> <br /> Each character is particularly delightful and memorable, from the contacts played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles - - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandfather with his pack of dogs! Each of these artists, in addition to Norman Jewison as a director, behaves above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For many of the actors, this was one of the first major shows in the film, so the cast is also exceptional - and we have many acting powerhouses that have changed their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film many times to the hilt - which can sometimes substantially deflate the impact of a movie. More explicitly, I realized some years ago that every time I surfed my way in a scene from this movie - any scene - the scene was compelling and wonderfully done. There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes the original meeting between the characters of Cher and Nicolas Cage, in which Cage tells his story of pain; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his lover at work, amid the splendor generated by his gold mine hydraulic activity; Olympia Dukakis reproaches John Mahoney for having swallowed up with his student in the classic line on contacts with colleagues: "Don't move where you eat!"; Danny Aiello at the bedside of his dying mother; Nicolas Cage "taking" Cher as the ecstasy of an air flies in the background! <br /> <br /> Of course there are many romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but above all Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / original William Holden); When Harry met Sally; The apartment. <br /> <br /> No one is the same as Moonstruck!
