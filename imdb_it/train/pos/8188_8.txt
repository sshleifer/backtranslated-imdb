I really enjoyed the first part of this two parter, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little worried that the second part couldn't hold up quite as well as it was in the past of the two parters of the past Who series. But fortunately my fears were unfounded because I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. Anyway, let's start with the surviving crew members escaping from the Ood, which has become the Devil's pawn. There is also a bit of philosophizing in the part of the Doctor in the episode that I really enjoyed. Needless to say, it was a good story about Doctor Who. It may be a little too intense for younger viewers. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B +
