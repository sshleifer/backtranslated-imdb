A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed with losing perspective and common sense. An evil wizard approaches him and informs him that he can give him a great wealth he can use to win the woman's heart if he agrees to give him everything he wants in his room. The stupid boy agrees and the magician steals the reflection of the man from the mirror - and consequently bad things occur naturally. <br /> <br /> If this film had been made only a decade later, I'm sure I wouldn't do it. I was so charitable in reviewing and scoring this movie. After all, the plot of the film is a bit vague and the acting is sometimes a little rigged. However, considering that in 1913 "full-length" films were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes! Furthermore, the idea of ​​a complex story like the one we get in this film is very unusual - because the stories were very short and widely interpreted. So, given the limits of time, this film is pretty good and is one of the first known horror movies.
