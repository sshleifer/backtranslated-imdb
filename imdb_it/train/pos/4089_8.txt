Strangely erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans around the world. It seems to be an interesting version of "Beauty and the Beast". It's definitely worth a look and surprisingly well interpreted taking into consideration the genre and the era. Corsets, castles, burning horses, furious monsters of fake fur in the woods, proof that nobody had a Brazilian in the 70s, and more body fluids than you can shake, what more could you want ?! <br /> <br /> My Sunday afternoon has definitely improved!
