Did the film transport everyone back to October 20, 1944, where we seemed to be part of the big Philippine "I Shall Return" landing scene ?? Was it on that coast Leyte where General MacArthur collected his fame ?? <br /> <br /> Above all, did Gregory Peck triumph in his interpretation of the great general ?? Is the step, the set of the shoulders, the intensity ?? Is this what they both had in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion ?? With MacArthur was it for the military ?? With Peck was it for the challenge of acting ?? Winner of an Oscar for "To Kill a Mockinbird", nominated for an Oscar for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman's Agreement" and "Twelve O'Clock High", he played everything from an apparently amnesic murder to a crusader journalist; from a gunslinger in trouble to an obsessed lawyer; from the biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower ?? Has he brought to them all his unique intuition, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and above all, his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" is on the bridge with the "President of the Philippines". We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water is not too deep", says the "President", "because my people will find out that I can't swim". Then comes Peck's sonorous voice: "And my people will find that I can't walk on water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur", did Peck again justify his reputation as a giant in the film industry ?? Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: did we know his anger, his happiness and did we understand the relationship with his whole family?
