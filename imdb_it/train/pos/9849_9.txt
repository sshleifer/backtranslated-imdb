When I saw the trailers I absolutely had to watch the movie. And when I had it, I had a feeling that seemed unsatisfied. It was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but I think the big parts where already in the trailers, if you capture my direction. He went very fast and continued, so I never got bored, and I enjoyed watching it. The humor was absolutely fantastic. My first contact with a sloth (..or something similar).
