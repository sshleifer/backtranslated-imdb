I've always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes, I found this film fantastic and I think every college student out there can agree with me. Although this is not a "film with a plot", it is about real guys and some of the "problems" they face. I found the film exhilarating (especially the parts where they played practical jokes on each other). In short, if you are in the same "wavelength" of these people, you will find this fantastic film. I don't think this is going to win any Golden Globes or Oscars, or that the people in this film will become future Hollywood stars, but it's kind of a "cult-classic" among young people that could relate to their experience. For me the boy who stands out the most is Hans: the Scandinavian boy, who, according to him, "is not an observer", but gets all (or some) chicks. Even the "little ones" play an important role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I could provide a spoiler and I don't want to do it, just go get the movie and you won't regret it. I give him an 8/10
