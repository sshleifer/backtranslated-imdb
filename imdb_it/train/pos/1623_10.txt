This is the comic that was supposed to win instead of Country Cousin. Visually well done and much more fun and memorable. It's worth watching just for the music alone! Although there are elements that will certainly weaken the sensitivity of some of these days, the comic must have a bit of perspective. He is over sixty years old and is, after all, just a cartoon. I am disabled and if I were hyper-sensitive like the people who look at things like this cartoon and rack their brains, I would have long curled up in a fetal position and gone. Sometimes you have to lighten up, put your head back and float! Cartoons of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never particularly flattering. It is said that Bing Crosby hated it when it was used on more than one occasion. *SIGH*
