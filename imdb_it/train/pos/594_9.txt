13 days for Gloria tells the traditional story with sympathy for the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this film was that while the cowboy actor James Arness played the part of Jim Bowie persuasively, the rest of the cast-name actors Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old. > <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity due to the professional soldier who won the battle after all. The scene in which he criticizes his officers for not having assembled a guard and for preventing a draw is a script that he did not understand. Not being able to watch is a great negligence in the army. Santa Anna was in her prerogative to be angry. Raul Julia magnificently carried mediocre writings through the scene. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York may have been reminded that while Dickinsons came from Pennsylvania, they probably didn't play much Southron.
