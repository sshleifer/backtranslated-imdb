The Scottish piece by Michael Caton-Jones has few ties to Sir Walter Scott's novel of the same name ... <br /> <br /> The film opens in the Scottish highlands, with Robert Roy McGregor and his men seeking a group of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of His Lordship James Graham's cattle ... The scene then goes on to a battle of sword fights involving nobles with longhair wigs, ornate shirts, soft colored coats, pale makeup and conventional gestures. . <br /> <br /> MacGregor lives under the protection of a local gentleman by the name of Marquis of Montrose ... When he enters a reckless trade agreement with Montrose, he leaves himself innocently exposed to the evil plots of the wicked of Montrose - who does. .. The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the film, even if it takes a repulsive turn with a violent rape ... When Rob Roy is finally forced to rebel against the English soldiers, the action becomes well understood, finishing with the pre a duel between him and an expert with the blade ... <br /> <br /> Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character ... He is intelligent, loyal and virile ... He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chief of a small community ... He is a loving father, a passionate lover and a noble husband, driven to desperate gestures by wicked vacationers ... He would rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust ... . <br /> <br /> Academy Award winner Jessica Lange gives the film class the robust and devoted wife, a proud peasant, brutally raped by a cold psychotic aristocrat ... Lange's lines are full of dignity and integrity: "I will think of you dead, until my husband does it to you. And then I will no longer think of you." <br /> <br /> John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with the roles of the characters to make Montrose something more than an avid marquis, ruthless of money and tempered by the fashion of the English court for foppery ... He is an arrogant and pompous man with two wicked servants at his service ... The honor, in his opinion, seems a bizarre thing. .. It has two objectives: to ruin the reputation of its rival, the Duke of Argyle, and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor ... Send his soldiers to burn the houses of the Highlanders, to kill their people and their livestock. .. <br /> <br /> Tim Roth ?? the perfect antithesis d of the hero, it is frightening and strangely an effeminate enforcer ... He is a penniless British aristocrat, a wonderfully evil ugly "hired sword" who kidnaps and kills his way through the Scottish fog ... His name is Archibald Cunningham ... It turns out that being a liar, a thief and a murderer ... He takes leave of himself as "but a bastard abroad, in search of his fortune and the favor of great men", and therefore cannot to interest anyone else: "Love is a dung hill and I'm just a cock that climbs on it to sing". He even jokes that he once raped a boy he mistook for a girl ... <br /> <br /> Cunningham looks pathetic ... He smiles foolishly, and utters words with affected refinement, but not terribly harmful, until a muscular swordsman does not insult him and we discover that he is a beautiful head and an expert with a sword ... He really stole the film with a performance that earned him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor ... <br /> <br /> And while Brian Cox is appropriately hateful as Killearn, Andrew Keir is Montrose's rival, the powerful local aristocrat, the Duke of Argyll, one of the few trusted men McGregor meets outside his family ... <br /> <br / > Set in eighteenth-century Scotland and with a striking soundtrack, 'Rob Roy' is truly a love story between a man and his wife, a recognizable human story, unjustly dwarfed by 'Braveheart' by Mel Gibson, which tells the story of same story as the risentim provincial body of overbearing English landowners ...
