To a certain extent, I really liked this film better than the original Vampires. I found that movie pretty misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I'm used to the fact that women in danger are a staple of the genre. But they slap Sheryl Lee too often. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a more complete character, and the main villain is a girl! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vampire in BLADE) is very otherworldly and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, yes, no great actor, but he does it OK. At least he doesn't start singing. Take it on the cable, if you can. It's on Encore Action this month.
