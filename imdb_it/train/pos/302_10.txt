This film is perfect for all the romantics of the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the film! "Sam" hits close to home, it's nice to look at and so fun to play together. Ben Gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I met Arthur on my travels somewhere. All around, an excellent choice to take any evening.! :-)
