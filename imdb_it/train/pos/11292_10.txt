I saw this film once as a child in the end-end show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took more than 30 years, but recently I found it on DVD - it wasn't cheap, or - in a catalog specializing in war movies. We saw it last night for the first time. The sound was good, yet it was grainy and had trailers between the wheels. Even so, it was better than I remembered it. I was also impressed by how true the game was. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are honest in finding it, fire me a letter and see if I can get you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
