I saw this independent film when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true, hilarious story! He also has some great character actors. Mindy Sterling is inside and is very good. I loved it at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also fantastic. I remember it from Head of the Class. I'm tired of all the dark edgy movies that continue to be made. This is fun and light, and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed. I keep checking to see when it comes out on DVD. I will definitely buy it
