If you want to see something that is for "him" and "her", then this is the movie to choose from. I'm a sucker for the com coms but my husband isn't always so passionate (what a guy !!!). Anyway, I managed to show him why I told him it was sport, and you know what, he loved it !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and his protagonist (I'm sorry but I can remember his name) is just as good. When I saw the film it was called "The Perfect Match", but I think the title was changed for the UK because it is based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a football film with that title (the same film but the film Version for the United Kingdom - phew!), <br /> <br /> However all the reviews above will tell you more details if you need them to buy girls, take them from me, bring your hubby / guy in front of the TV one Saturday night and you'll laugh and cry together. A real gem.
