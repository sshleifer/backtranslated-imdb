I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so compelling and terrifying ... so it was the pilot's part 2 ... I'll definitely be back on this show! This is the real survivor! I've seen some of the other comments and I can see that even after just one or two episodes the morons are already crying wolf ... Sorry if it's not another reality show, kids! Once upon a time there was a time where they were ... now get ready! Real TV shows! And this is actually good as opposed to most of the shoddy sitcoms today or the umm-teenth carbon copy of a Law & Order or the NYPD Blue or CSI series that they're distributing ... See for yourself Opinion, don't take one from the boneheads here!
