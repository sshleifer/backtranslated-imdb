Kate Beckinsale is excellent as an manipulative Emma and irresistibly charming in this television adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. When I read that novel, I was sometimes dubious enough that the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: honestly, it is so terribly hypocritical and intriguing that it is tempted to seriously detest it. The interpretation of Kate Beckinsale, however, saves Emma from herself so to speak: she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and one cannot help but give in and love (not to mention love) her despite her less than amiable qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this TV series is so delicious; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, fully expressing the personal magnetism of this character (which is all the more evident because this role is not well managed by Ewan McGregor in Emma's 1996 film adaptation), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. This production is, in short, a great success and one to be seen many times with increasing pleasure.
