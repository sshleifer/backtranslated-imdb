First of all I made this VHS movie that I had to buy on DVD, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book, but I really think the film is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. It was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
