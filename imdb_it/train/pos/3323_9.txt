I received this movie about a month ago and now I'm a huge fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending and this film gives a splendid success with the truths of Red Sox! He is a math teacher who brings some promising kids on a math journey to a company where Lindsey's (Drew) success shows them some information. This then leads to the dating of Ben (teacher) and Lindsey. But it's not all that simple when he confesses to being a big Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, things are going well, but then his baseball gets into Lindseys life. In the end it's all right and it took forever to let Drew run on the field !! I took it for two quid in Blockbuster, so I was happy. If you like movies like this I suggest you see more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even his new film with Hugh Grant in "Music and Lyrics".
