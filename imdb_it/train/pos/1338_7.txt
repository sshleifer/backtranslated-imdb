The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to the directors' lack of quality and imagination. Besides Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai did not stand out. The CCCC has had many fines due to the financing of the film and this, not really knowing what the film is about, has generated good publicity and sales of advanced tickets for the film in India and abroad. The only information given was that it was a suspense. The film was released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot has to do with surrogacy and is well managed. Salman and Preiti give a good performance in which Salman does not actually take off his shirt ... they must be special effects !! Rani plays Salmans' wife, but it is a slightly less demanding role than Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main protagonists confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, that they have a solid screen and an off-screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays an important role in the film as a successful businessman and it is a shame to be exploited as an aspiring comedian in his other films because he is rather underrated in the Mumbai film industry, partly because of movie he chooses. Rani's character doesn't know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... this was held by her and the rest of the family ... the rest you should find out how it will ruin the movie if I told you. The songs are all well represented, especially dekhne walon and the main song of the title. The other supporting actors make a minimal but delicate effort like Salmans who loves the family. Abbas Mastan has produced a success and has treated the subject of the film with tact ... I say go and see it or rent it as you like!
