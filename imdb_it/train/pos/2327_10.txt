A 14-year-old girl develops her first crush on the 17-year-old boy who lives nearby, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic film about the growth of director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for having previously directed the summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the genus of the coming of age. Here he directs the newcomers in the main roles: Reese Witherspoon, in his film debut, as the 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, like the older sister; Jason London, like Court, the 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is extraordinarily good in his film debut, showing all the emotions that a 14-year-old girl experiences experiencing young love and pain, without ever beating a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good. The film accurately describes the thoughts or feelings of every teenager regarding love with a sincere sensitivity, without ever going beyond maudlin even once. Congratulations on the autobiographical script by Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from one scene to another, but it never becomes intrusive. The beautiful photograph is by the famous director of horrid Freddie Francis, who was about 70 years old when he was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston interpret the parents of the girls with dead precision for 1957, thoughtful, rigorous and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the boy's mother. There are feelings to be resolved, lessons to be learned and truths to be faced in this sweet film that contains a strong emotional impact. To date, this is the last film by Robert Mulligan. This is one of the best films of 1991. 4-star ****.
