Jafar Panahi's dramatic comedy "Offside" depicts women trying to get into a Tehran sports arena from which women are banned. The official reason: a lot of vulgar language, and soccer players show off their legs. Of course, it's really a case of sexism. Thus, most of the film consists of a bland comic relief when women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium, and a woman also comes with her scheme to challenge men. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, all Jafar Panahi films (this included) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the CIA Prime Minister in 1953 and the subsequent support of the brutal Shah gave the Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinist society, and that the current George W. Bush on Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to be a cowboy and make a censor. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a clean look at people who come up with ways to challenge the system. It's not a great film, but it's worth seeing. Considering that all of Jafar Panahi's films are banned, I wonder how he is able to make them.
