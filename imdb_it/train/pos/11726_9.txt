when my sister said this movie would be good I had second thoughts but I saw it and it was really fun. at the bottom of the film is made of a strange girl who goes to a small town where nobody likes her and she just wants to go there and getting her aunts reading won't give her so she can go. but it's not that easy. In this film you will come across an exhilarating humor, a witch, a spell book / recopies, a mentally challenged uncle and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word "strange" anyway, I hope you run out and try to find this really old film. I hope you like it in total I will have to give him a 0 .... no, I'm joking completely, by a 9 I hope you understand that he will laugh, you will scream and you might just be offended. <br /> <br /> your love really: Dakota can email me at dakota_loves_en @ hot mail.com if you want
