Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really beautiful movies and sets, and yes, even Dietrich's bottomless bag is fabulous. She is very well; Boyer looks young and attractive. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman who seeks meaning and a former priest who seeks life seems rather stale, but against sets and unreal skies works in some way, given the two stars, Max's fantastic score Steiner is a good support cast. The film has a duration of 76 minutes and seems to have changed badly, plus some characters appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is as fun as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson, the mother superior, Tilly Losch, the dancer, John Carradine the soothsayer, and Basil Rathbone plays. .. well, I'm not sure. He rides from the desert and ruins everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was to act with Dietrich. I can't help but think it would have been wonderful. The role of Boris tired of the world would have adapted quite well to the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), her career could be back on track. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any other 1930s film that Dietrich did in color. He looks great and wears fantastic clothes. My favorite is the Valentino as the Shiek dress he wears in the pool. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth taking a look at the lush sets and colors and the two big stars.
