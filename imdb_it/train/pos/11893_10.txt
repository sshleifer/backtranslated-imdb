The next two seasons of this original series were less brilliant. The last disastrous reshuffle season contributed to its short life span of three seasons. Perhaps if the plug had been thrown after the first season it would have gained a cult following. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the first season was really hilarious! Witty, intelligent with superb writing, he was promising. The excellent first season beer had the right ingredients: characters / actors, plot and so on. Also, a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to start. Nora and her fellow "photographers" in search of prey, night after night, day after day for exclusives. <br /> <br /> Many things make no sense to me. Like how this show, and another favorite of mine - Gross Pointe has never "done". If only the first Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe seasons were released on DVD, please someone out there ?!
