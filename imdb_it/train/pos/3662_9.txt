This is a really weird movie - and it's NOT a bad thing. It's a combination of a neorealist film about the homeless AND a fairy tale. I'm sure some might find this movie a little weird, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of ordinary people (not actors) and gets a great ensemble performance. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point to make - this is very absurd. Ignore the special effects of the cheese - after all, it was created in the early 1950s and the special effects are still not very important (or at least they shouldn't be in the movies). Instead, sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride. Unless you are a mottled total, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I reviewed this film, I saw another film directed by DeSica that is a must see and that is CHILDREN ARE LOOKING TO THE UNITED STATES. Although it is not a fantasy or a light in spirit like MIRACOLO A MILANO, a great film however.
