Larry Fessenden was impressed with most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake, obviously, is the commercialization of the film and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror movie, at least, not for people who expect something that will be bloody and immediately satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a film that seems to be told by the mind of young Miles. Things that are not easily understood by children tend to remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the threatening world they cannot understand. It's obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what's going on in her son's mind. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that his father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to live in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles' fears reach a crisis point over the weekend in the country. That part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, arid trees, devastated the boy's imagination. It doesn't help that you meet a strange figure in the city, it creates even more doubts in your young mind. After all, the world of Miles falls upon him and he can do nothing, even evoking the spirit of Wendigo. <br /> <br /> The film is well set and performed. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter what movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as a distant father who has the opportunity to get close to a child he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, transmits the inner turmoil inside him. I thought it was extremely effective since the whole movie is played by Miles about what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is as perfect as the threatening Otis, a man who resents the way he arrived. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting this film in the cinema, prospective viewers should approach it with an open mind.
