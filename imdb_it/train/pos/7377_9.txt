this film is practically impossible to describe. the alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinema, the story is not as linear as the American one. The story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a deserter from World War II. The set is haunted (?) By a dead actress (?) During the filming of a television program in the 60s. the director is the ONLY one who saw this show. if you've seen Ringu (the director Hideo Nakata is the same) and you liked it, you'll like the ghost actress. i loved the ghost actress much more than ringu. a truly disturbing and disturbing film. a 10!
