I wanted to see him for a long time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite films, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought it would be a great sequel after it started to drag on. The acting and the direction were fantastic. In fact, everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. Sometimes, the only thing that kept my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for the cameos of Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
