Before starting, I'm afraid of dentists. This film gives me chills and even makes me shiver. This is what I love about this movie. The film is a bit boring. For this, I take 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just discovered that his wife has betrayed him. Soon, he starts having hallucinations and starts torturing his patients, killing collaborators, and even torturing his wife to death and killing the man he was having an affair with. <br /> <br /> * End spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you're gore. <br /> <br /> Give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist!
