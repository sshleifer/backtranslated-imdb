I must say that this film gave me a double personality. I have been told over and over to do the nail and start talking like a normal person. But it's very difficult ... no, not the wang. Did you find it disgusting and disrespectful? Well, let's put ourselves in the mood for more. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show to your grandparents, but you should show it to a teenager or an immature guy at work. However, let us return to the mannerisms of the voice. Fortunately this site has a Ladies Man (someone in the studio has noticed that there should be an apostrophe (?) Between the e e s?) So you can always have something to say to your boss or the cops. I have a sheet in my wallet.
