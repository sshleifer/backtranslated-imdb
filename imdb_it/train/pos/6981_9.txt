For all the haters out there: condemning a TV series with an episode is like judging a whole book after reading the front pages. That said, I was a big BSG fan, I thought it was one of the best TV dramas (not just science fiction) on the air. But it was time for it to end and the story continued. I liked the epilogue of BSG "The Plan", but it raised the highest number of new questions that he answered, so I looked forward to "Caprica" ​​and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping he didn't try to be another BSG, and I was pleased that "Caprica" ​​is something different, and personally I found the story exciting, in a different way from the flaming space battles , sci-fi explosions and special effects (don't get me wrong, I like that stuff too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was simply wonderful. I can't wait until next week.
