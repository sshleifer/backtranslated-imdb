Allow yourself to be transported to a different kind of old school storytelling. Scoop is the classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's latest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in last year's Match Point, also by Allen), is surprisingly able to flatten her sensual kitty and turn into a kind of normal-looking student with the help of glasses and nerd outfits, but still fails to make the public believe how the Hugh Jackman character could be so impressed by her, given the director's background (don't worry, no spoilers here) . There are no major transformations for Johansson's character here, as he constantly interprets the same character despite the script that says otherwise. You've even forgiven your character's apparent lack of logic, continuing a relationship with a suspected serial killer, simply because it's his Royal Hotness Jackman, which is refreshing to see Wolverine's buggers. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what the 70-year-old Allen talks about. He continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always did; as if he had never been exposed to modern film production, which is probably what makes his film attractive and simple. They never seem to target a specific market; as if Allen did the movies to his taste alone, whether he liked it or not.
