This film should be requested for all librarians or aspiring librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. The subject of the public library against the academic library is a classic topic conducted among librarians and library school students. It also breaks many library stereotypes. Librarians might even be able to have fun, even if they * don't * usually have sex in the romantic languages ​​section! (The best film about librarians? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
