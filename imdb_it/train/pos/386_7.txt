Tsui Hark's visual art is at its peak in this film. Unfortunately the terrible acting of Ekin Cheng and especially of Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle her while watching this, it's so bad :) made it difficult to watch sometimes. <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw it, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I had never seen anything like it but this is how it should be done to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung novels - was! Without a doubt this is one of the most beautiful Chinese historical kung-fu epics ever made. <br /> <br /> But alas, Tsui Hark hasn't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are quite youthful (his apparent obsession with the stupid and overly long description of bad guys didn't help either ). To make matters worse, this film is misinterpreted. They decided to use the "hot" popular idols of Hong Kong as protagonists, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited to the historical dramas of kung-fu because they lack the nobility and mystique these characters should embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. I hope that one day Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a film that has the visual art of Tsui but with the maturity and narrative poetry of Zhang ...
