NOTICE SPOILER! This film, Zero Day, offers an interior to the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with the school. <br /> <br /> They go on a series of self-Thought Out "Missions" All driving the enormous mission, which is Zero Day. The Zero Days content is not specified until the middle of the film. The viewer knows he is serious and full of hate, but he is never sure enough until the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know, if the film is based on the massacre of the dove, the end is quite obvious. And the end is no different than any other attack film, they go and kill many of their fellow students at the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen many films about this attack and this film Far is my favorite and the most respected. It gives the viewer and within it a look at the lives of these two teenagers who hate life, and honestly gives the viewer some aspects of understanding and closing the horrible event. <br /> <br /> Being Only 7 When the events took place, I never knew the seriousness of the shooting, until my English course was given an essay or a story about a decisive moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone was going to choose the twin towers, but I wanted to be different, because obviously the twin towers were tragic and very definitive, but I didn't think it was the right choice for me because there really was no way for that that was about, i was only in 3rd grade and had no idea what it meant. But the shooting has left and effect. I remember the interviews, the views of the school's sky, and the pain and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This film is a compelling, down to earth and a horrible masterpiece, and I would have recommended it to anyone.
