This film was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already anticipated. It was certainly a spectacularly amazing film. It's an incredible story, with extraordinary actors and creators. Definitely another great film with Denzel Washington. (it shouldn't surprise anyone) Derek Luke did a great job.
