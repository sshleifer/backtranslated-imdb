I really enjoyed this movie. Many Koreans will feel familiar with this film because many of them have teachers when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The film would have been better if the angel or the camera movement were more irregular. The editing, however, was very accurate and unusual. <br /> <br /> Even the acting was very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent and weak girl in Korean soap operas. But this time, he plays a tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his very credible role. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is that the emotion of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romantic movies that the characters cry at the front of the public and I always thought it was very stale. There were no crap in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very fun and well done.
