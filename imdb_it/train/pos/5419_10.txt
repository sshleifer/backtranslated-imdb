This is an old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of Indians was unacceptable. But this movement is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, camaraderie, acting, directing, music and photography, and it's wonderful on all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is superb. This is the last film friend.
