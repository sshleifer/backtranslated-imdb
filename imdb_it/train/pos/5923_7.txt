A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) moved to a small town and have to deal with an evil teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and one hell of a big secret. <br /> <br /> Ok, technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so funny! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (involving the grain) happen, people get scared about the kittens, there are bad jokes, there is too much cheese to manage! <br /> <br /> So, yes. You will like this. A lot. It will not move you, it will touch you, it will frighten you or excite you in any way, but it will make you have fun and laugh!
