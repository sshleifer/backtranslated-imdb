The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the new spy kid on the block, closes his quest for his identity as he also tries to close the latest CIA program "Blackbriar" to create super assassins like him. <br /> <br /> I was so excited about this that I saw his predecessors yesterday and today. The identity was brilliant as a memory and supremacy remains the weak (but still pleasant) link in the chain due to the weaker pattern and, apart from a chase by car that the pursuit of this film easily overcomes, light without action and suspense . <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, Ultimatum has suspense! Even when you know that Bourne escapes the authorities (and these films point out the police as inept), it's still brilliant to watch him do it. It's amazing to think that two guys with hand guns and mopeds can create 10 times more suspense than anything that those $ 150 million giant robots have done in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Throw it at Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style by filming sticam to the documentary, even if he is filming characters that are anything but ordinary, in places like the CIA headquarters, where no one with a camcorder could have accessed anyone within 10 miles. He seemed to be listening to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than majestic, with various instruments used as weapons as a candelabrum, a hardcover book (I will never see them the same way again) and an electric fan ( do not ask). Music has also helped generate a lot of suspense, and there was almost never a moment not to bite. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, and the evolution of the character of Julia Stiles "Nicky" has put her situation in a new very understanding light. Damon plays his main role with reserve but competence (which seems minor but it really seems that Matt Damon can evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but remarkable moments of intensity while still struggling to find his humanity. This desire for a real life could become boring, and almost done in Supremacy, but it works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I am reminded of a scene from "Goldeneye" (the only Pierce Brosnan Bond movie) in which the character of Sean Bean asks James if the martinis silence the screams of all men who killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed and considers (or at least makes me consider) the meaning of aimless action, meaningless life and the way the government has turned men into resources. Although the resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons from anything. Sidenote: I was always bothered by the fact that, despite being an overdose and pursued by the CIA, Interpol and the police, almost EVERYWHERE goes, that Bourne never thought of making even the smallest attempts to mask his features or create new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have an action and love action movie, then Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action movie released this year. Of course, you'd be crazy to see it without looking at the others first. The end is approaching, but I am almost tempted to ignore it. This is the first "3" movie this summer to match at least, if not exceed, the original and this is saying something. <br /> <br /> A-
