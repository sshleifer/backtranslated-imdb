DOCTEUR PETIOT, with Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if their capacity for compensation does not exist. And yet, it preaches the weakest among the population. Images and cinematography are superb and give a further gruesome feeling to this complex story. It's the perfect psychopath. Seductive and selfless, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A film certainly not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. Congratulations to Mr. Serrault, for his chilling portrait.
