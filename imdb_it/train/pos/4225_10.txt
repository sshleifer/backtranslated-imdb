Ruth Gordon is one of the most understanding killers Columbo has ever had to deal with. And the plot is brilliant all the time. This is one of the best episodes of Columbo ever. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk offers something more in his scenes with Gordon.
