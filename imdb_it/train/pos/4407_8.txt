For those who commented on The Patriot as accurate, (which basically satanized English), it was interesting to see this film. By all accounts this was the bloodiest war in which Americans were ever involved, and they were the only presence of the nationality. It was therefore very pleasant to see something similar to the historical precision coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not depict America as martyrs or saviors. All in all, even if what this film brought home was the real horror of every conflict, and the way in which any act performed in war generates only worse actions, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie where you encouraged anyone, but both filled with compassion and hated.
