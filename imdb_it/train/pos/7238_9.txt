Small warning SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY nice movie. And I'm surprised to say, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of director Deran Serafian's name usually means bad news. Most of his films are below-average action films like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued to make horror films instead of acting. This film really fascinated me. A good result, given that there were no famous actors or big budgets. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially the fans of the myth of Dracula will be satisfied. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of Bram Stoker's famous story and remains quite loyal and true to the truth. He explains the life of Count Dracula and how he frightened the Turkish army by shooting dead corpses in front of his castle. Of course, that is where reality stops and "based on a true story". The blood that drinks and everything was invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this film, the count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the United States and seduces tons of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give them to you. Overall, good acting of unknown faces, enough blood and blood to satisfy the most morbid horror fans and an interesting plot. This film is really unknown and has been hidden on the darkest shelf of my local video recorder. But it is certainly worth cleaning the dust off the cover and inserting it in the video recorder. Heck, it's much better than Nicole Kidman's famous movie with the same title. These two films have nothing else in common, but I blame that movie for stealing attention to this beautiful photo. Take a look ... my humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5 / 10
