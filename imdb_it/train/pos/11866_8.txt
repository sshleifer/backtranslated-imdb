Most people who have seen this film think it's the best movie ever made. I disagree, but this film is very good. Tony is a bad guy and he knows he is intimidating and uses it to keep going. It's about him and the way he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and an office with cocaine all over the desk. If you want a family movie, this is not the way to go, but if you want mobsters and revenge and things like that then you'll like it.
