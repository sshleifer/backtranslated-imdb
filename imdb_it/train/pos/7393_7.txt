This film was awesome. My first experience with a foreign film was neither too long nor too complex. I liked the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son who visited his elderly father and his late brother after a long separation appeared initially as a clich√©, but it turned out to be very touching and realistic. There was also a subtle sense of humor so as not to depress or annoy the public.
