This film scared me from the first day I saw it. Mom had seen him when he was on television in '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night from her tears of tears as my father helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> He was saying something like "Don't let me take it" or something. I asked what made her so upset and she told me she was watching The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> So obviously I had to watch it and even though I was only eleven he left me. It scared the hell out of me. I've been immune to horror movies since I saw this!
