Since I studied Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my reference models, and her interpretation in this as a woman who helps the man she loves to synchronize with her feminine side is magnificent. I never thought his character was in the hands of a minor actress, but Walters pushes him with taste and brio. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to date in the male lead.
