This film is neither morbid nor depressing. It's sad, because AIDS in the early 1990s was sad. But his real message is love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term love affair. Their mutual devotion is immediately evident, and as the ravages of AIDS intensify and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly moving. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a consultant in an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its time, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the same experiences I saw every day in real life. I knew from direct experience how it was watching AIDS devour previously lively, young and healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was like watching my friends in real life deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even after all these years, strikes me again.
