Green Eyes is a great movie. In today's context of supporting our troops, it is interesting to note that this film shows the lack of respect of the soldiers received from performing their duties during this period. From a historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War has left us all with something to remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this film, and he deserved the credits he received writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I don't understand why this film is not shown more often, or at all. This film is the kind of movie that should be shown on TV every year, just like the Wizard of Oz. A man's dedication to his lost son is entirely moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. rocky
