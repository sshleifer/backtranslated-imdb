Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of an aspiring rapist. Well done to Farrah for being a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. <br /> <br /> When his rapist Joe (played so terrifyingly by James Russo) enters his home, which he shares with his two roommates (who are conveniently out!), Marjorie has to play with the creepy demands of Joe. Make some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When his roommates return home, they are amazed (to say the least) by Marjorie's actions, and a great performance by Alfre Woodard who desperately tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn it into police makes the film even more pungent. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid rather annoying, but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all, it makes the movie a very emotional drama. <br /> <br /> In general, Extremities is a brilliant and well thought film and I must have watched it hundreds of times! Well done to everyone.
