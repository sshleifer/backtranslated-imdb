The story of the FBI, told from the point of view of agent Stewart through flashbacks, is intertwined with his personal history. Stewart and Miles (like his wife) are pretty good, like Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching fragments of a dozen different movies while catching the name of a gangster cast. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short and some simply seem out of place (the school sequence of Stewart's daughter). Overall, it goes on too long. However, it's worth taking a look at its beautiful production values.
