I came across this movie when I was doing some stuff on Caesars Palace, because I fell in love with its rich Las Vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still in good condition (unless you count Bally's, the 'original MGM Grand). In this respect, this film offers full strength. You are given a great tour of the Caesars property, which despite all the renovations and additions they have made over the last 40 years has been opened, looks similarly alarming. As a film as a whole, the plot is rather difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrendous editing. And when I say horrible, I'm not using that word lightly. There are lots of bits and pieces of Las Vegas traffic, casino crowds and even a scene where the character of Robert Drivas is conversing with his father about how he grew up, and without any explanation, he (Drivas Va (in those infamous fragments ) from being himself, from a child, from a boy, and then coming back alone while talking back and forth with his father. (This does not provide details on the plot, if anything it can be prepared and maybe they won't be as stunned as me from editing.) The film has aged well otherwise, and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that many kids could relate to in some way or way.
