"A Family Affair" brings us back to a less complicated moment in America. It makes one think about how everything was different then. It was a more innocent era in our country and we look at a "functional" family that takes care of things together. The film also marks the beginning of the series with the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Seitz, is based on a successful work. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily are facing an internal crisis that needs to be addressed. The married daughter Joan returns home after committing a social error and her husband holds her responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home a boyfriend, which is clear will clash with her father. The adolescent Andy, happy, seems to be the only one without problems until his mother will make him accompany Polly to the dance, which he is reluctant to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will demonstrate why he knows best while putting into action a plan to bring everyone together again. After all, he is a man who understands, not just the law, but how to deal with those external forces that threaten his position in the community and what will make his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore will play Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. The Byington spring is seen as Emily, the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small part in this film, but it's as always, fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon have appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly, the girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> "A Family Affair" is a good way to observe our past through the positive painted image of an American family.
