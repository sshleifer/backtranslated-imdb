I watched this film many years ago and I have been looking for it since then, in my opinion, even if it is very crude, it is very instructive about what the future can hold, I liked the film and for this reason it is very sorry for all those who do not I agree but a film should always be judged by everyone and in my opinion it is a great pleasure to try it with all the children of cloning and the test tube that are happening today, who we are to judge this film, this could be an event dramatized of what it is to become but you go there. All the horrors of today are so far-fetched, I also laugh, but this makes me think and scares me like a mother and if I were desperate, after seeing this film, I would think twice I'm sorry but I love the movie. don't look at the making of the film - just know the story and ask yourself how far you would go for a child?
