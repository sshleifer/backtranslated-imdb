I thought Mukhsin was wonderfully written. It's not just entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin was trying to convey. And yes, it could be confusing to some of you (especially if you don't watch Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet you noticed how they use the characters in the two movies right first? It's really ironic how the characters relate. As the bully neighbor is that prostitute of Gubra. And the snooker chick turns out to be the religious and the pious man's wife in the future. <br /> <br /> And I love voice-overs. It is rough but incredibly fresh. For example, when they took a picture of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin sign, suddenly Mukhsin's voice said "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (the scene in which he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> He captured the attitude of the Malay (and in a certain way kind, giggling no matter how pathetic) portrayed in the character. For example, even children can be really silent (complete with the annoying and high-pitched voice) and simply bad mouth for the whole movie. And how can one be so busy and talk about ppl, when one's life is not resolved. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this film fully met my expectations if it did not pass. <br /> <br /> He kept me glued to the screen, I couldn't even take my eyes off it. Not even to be distinguished in the cinema. Ha ha.
