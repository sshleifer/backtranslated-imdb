John Thaw, of Inspector Morse's fame, plays old Tom Oakley in this film. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War. A little recluse, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while serving during the First World War. If you can imagine retired Inspector Morse, twice as cruel as when he was a cop, then you have the character of Tom Oakley. <br /> <br /> Yet this heart of flint is about to melt. The children of London are evacuated before the blitz. The young William (Willie) Beech is rented by the protest Tom. Willie is played positively by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs treatment with a capital C. Behind school, which is still wetting the bed and unable to read, is the smallest of his problems. It comes from a horrible experience in London, with a mother who can't make it, to put it gently. <br /> <br /> Slowly, but constantly, the man and the boy warm each other up. Tom discovers his ability to love and take care of him again. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See Tom and Willie building a bomb shelter at the bottom of their garden. Watch Willie's joy in what is probably his first ever Tom birthday party. <br /> <br /> Don't give away the ending, but Willie is adopted by Tom after many struggles, and the couple starts a new life much richer for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson are following a long series of films in which the man meets the boy and develops mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captains Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face". <br /> <br /> Two points of interest. This is the only appearance of Thaw that I know where he sings. Only a verse from a hymn, New Jerusalem, but sings. <br /> <br /> Second, the young Robinson also starred in a second film with "Tom" in the title, "Tom's Midnight Garden", which is based on a classic children's novel.
