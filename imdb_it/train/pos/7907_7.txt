I could not be less in agreement with the evaluation that was given to this film, and I think this is an example of how most viewers are low-minded all over the world. Really ... Are you forgetting that cinema was a kind of art before some moguls tried to make it just entertainment? This film is not entertainment, at least it is not an easy entertainment that you get on films like Titanic or Gladiator. It has a style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why many of you hated it so much: because it doesn't try to be pleasing to you. It's just a story, a very strange thing that I admit, but after all, just a strange story. It is not a great story, not even a great cinematographic work, but I believe it is worth a 7-star evaluation only for the courage of the author and the director to shoot a story that is not meant to please the public, selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer. This film is, for me, a European-style film produced in the United States and all those involved in the making of this film deserve respect. Both for courage and for the unique sense of humor.
