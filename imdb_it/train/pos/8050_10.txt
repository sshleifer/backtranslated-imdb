The most agile and fat man in martial arts still does it. A first Sammo film that imitated the hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is incredibly Lee as in his actions and in his fights. The way he slips into Bruce's style and then into his more familiar kung fu is a joy to behold and shows how skilled and adaptable he is to his art. Throw some slapstick humor so loved by this kind of film and this is a film that has it all - comedy (a little unintentional, like the fake black guy), action and some incredible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> A great beer and film for friends that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time.
