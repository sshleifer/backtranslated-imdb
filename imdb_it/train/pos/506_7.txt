A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does a great job in creating the characters and the background of "Enterprise", the "prequel" of the original "Star Trek" series. Sometimes he stumbles into "Trek" convention and clich√© - the caramel-colored strippers never seem to go out of fashion, and I can already foresee mawkish references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the whole seems strong, the characters are well drawn, and we can already see that this particular crew will have to be more enterprising, in different ways, than those of the previous (successive?) series. Scott Bakula strikes the right note as a captain with the audacity and audacity of Kirk, but without his complacency and his bravado, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will see the presence of the engineer, the commander of the weapons and communications (not just a glorified telephone operator!) as support players. The writers seem to have caught the one big mistake made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": instead of starting with a large ensemble cast and giving the characters little choice, start with a a smaller nucleus of characters to which a little more variety can be added later, which I hope will happen, because after about half a dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.
