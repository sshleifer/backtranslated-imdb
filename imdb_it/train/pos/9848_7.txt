I watched this film with my eyes as a child, and I was not disappointed. The story is well known, an abandoned orphan must be brought to his parents by an unlikely trio (mamooth - saboteur tiger and a lazy animal) ... And I don't want to forget to mention the incredible little furious animal with his hazenut. This really made me laugh a lot during the whole photo. <br /> <br /> In short: it works, it's fun and it's a "must-see" with your kids (they'll like it).
