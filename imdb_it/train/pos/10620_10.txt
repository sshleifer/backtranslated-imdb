At first glance, I found this story at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many others, I think it's one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty ugly, especially the love song, but two things stand out that make the film, even the song, useful. One is the art direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated period piece; each piece of fabric and jewel (both have important parts in the plot of this film) seem fresh and new, and contrast with the simple clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song I find myself studying the princess's dress and hair, beautifully done. The other thing is comic timing. Much of the film is poor, but the emperor's vanity (and his making fun of himself in the end), the suspicious guard, the guard chasing Nicholas and the stupid prince, have all been pretty funny and seem to be ridiculous for the purpose. And the sequence during the song Weave-O makes up for the songs that weren't so good.
