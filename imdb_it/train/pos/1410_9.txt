EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 The adaptation to the big screen of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers a truly majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly incredible moments of "how the hell did they get there?" this movie?! "while observing the fantastic scenarios of animals in their natural habitats and the environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel (witness a great white shark swallowing a walrus seal like a quick meal!) and adorable (the various children and their holidays). The narrator's low tone narrator James Earl Jones consolidates his "views of the eye of God" and its depth. Collected from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only complaint comes from the fact that this should have been in the IMAX format and could even have gone longer! Oh, well, there's always next time (since Disney Studios have produced this count on a series of others to come). Dir: Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield.
