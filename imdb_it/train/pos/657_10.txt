Maman et la Putain must be seen as a film that is related to the time it was published (post-68) and is eternal in many respects. It is true, the actors do not "act" ... It is true, they talk a lot ... But what they talk about is only what makes life worth living ... or death. Françoise Lebrun's very long monologue is perhaps the most accurate and moving text ever written on femininity, virility and love. It's not easy to translate accurately, though. This film is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). AND IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
