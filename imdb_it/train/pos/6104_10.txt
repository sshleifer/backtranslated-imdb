I must admit that, outside of the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, this must be what I love more than any other that I have also reviewed. History is something that really keeps you looking. A lot of EROS movies have a plot that looks like a hammer tore it to pieces before production when you watch it. All centered on sex, and who can arrive with as many different people arrive at the end of the film. And oh my god, never look at one of these movies when someone pulls out a gun. It doesn't work that it's almost ridiculous, but you don't want to waste energy doing it. <br /> <br /> "Losing control" is exactly how its name turns on. The main character, the main character (the wonderful and talented Kira Reed). Control is the control a person has over his or her senses, over their body and their feelings. And a man changes everything for her, makes her almost a different woman. But the mirror is shattered at the same time. This is a great movie that I wish I had created first !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
