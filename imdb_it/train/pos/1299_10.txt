I took some of this concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. The boys give everyone at the Royal Albert an excellent performance, often electrifying, complete in every way. Pure, too - no synths, no lasers wrapped in smoke and strobe lights, no grand entrances (and a non-detached, serious and grateful audience who left their bottle rockets at home). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Cream (or if you have only heard of it); if you are a fan of blues; if you are a rock 'n' roll fan; you will not be disappointed when viewing and listening to this DVD. You will also never miss this DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell him to get theirs!) It's too beautiful and too replayable; you will want to keep it close at hand.
