I really enjoyed this movie. The acting of the adult actors was great, even though I found the main child a bit stiff. But he behaved very well to be a new talent. Humor is very sublime and not on your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. That is, the mad professor. If you have a poor attention span and are used to things typical of Hollywood you probably won't like it because it's a little slower. I took it on Blu-ray and I must say that the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the best Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were also fantastic. They've erased quite a bit, but it's probably a good thing since most deleted scenes haven't added anything.
