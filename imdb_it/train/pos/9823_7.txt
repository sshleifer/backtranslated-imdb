I really thought it wasn't so bad. Not a great work of art, but Dermot M was by far the strongest interpreter. Patricia Arquette was exaggerating most of the time. He actually played a cello that was very impressive and his jokes had never been forced. Moreover, he is an incredibly handsome man. Really sexy Add it to the talent and most of what it has been in is much more tolerable. It always gives the best even if some of the projects in which it was involved did not reach the highest score. It is not the actor's fault in most cases. Unfortunately it was in some strange films that did not resound at the box office. Always with A-list actors but not always a "hit". But he "is worth every penny" of any DVD rented or purchased. See The Wedding Date with Debra Messing - one of his best films ever. IT IS EVERY PENNY! ; ) (if you haven't seen it yet, do it, then you'll understand that quote!)
