This film was one of my childhood favorites and I have to say that, unlike other films that I liked at the time, The Thief of Baghdad maintained its quality while I grew up. This is not just a film to be enjoyed by children, it can also be seen and appreciated by adults. The only drawback that exists is that one cannot see beyond the "bad" effects (compared to the effects today) as one could do when one was a child. I didn't remember any of those effects, of course it had been about ten years since I saw this movie, when I was about eleven. Who then looks at the effects? One only looks for good stories and entertainment and that's exactly what this film offers. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think of it, I feel like the Indiana Jones movies were a bit like this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning to the end and even if the film is old and the music and style of the film is clearly not modern, it manages to be dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great history, good direction and good recitations of the actors. In that department, Sabu (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar) stand out, providing the comic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great movie and even if an "old man", definitely a "goldie". I hope someone has the brains and courage to publish this DVD in one day. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
