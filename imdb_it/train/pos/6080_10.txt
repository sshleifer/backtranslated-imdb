Otello, the classic Shakespearean story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare perfectly captured the feeling of friendship, love and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, you could get into so many philosophies about why Othello went mad with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also looked at this version of Otello and I must say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth have just captured the story so well and realized it's dark. <br /> <br /> Othello is the soldier of great time in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello has escaped with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is enraged, but excludes him. Othello is welcome to the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his man instead of Iago, who was in command of Othello. Because of his mad jealousy, he is out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he only mentions Othello that Desdemona betrays him with Cassio, he never says he is, he just thinks about Otello which is happening. Othello has gone mad and has no pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend reading it. It's an incredible story that makes you think after reading it. Othello the film is also great and once again I recommend it, it has captured the story perfectly and has a great kind of tear-jerking tears, or you could be completely shocked by what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes his true love would betray him. This is a fantastic film, great acting, good set and good direction, this is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
