I saw this film for the first time in theater when I was 8 and it still cracked me. The Muppets are fantastic and they approach the show business in a refreshing and naive way. My favorite scene is when the mice start a whisper campaign for Kermit in a luxury restaurant. This is a smart and fun movie for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
