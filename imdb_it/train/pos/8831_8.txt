Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> Although the lead actress is STRAKINGLY beautiful, the plot has little chance of being accepted because too many details that distract the audience during the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> It can be believed that in the 1950s the girls of the middle class adolescents gave away their virginity without thinking of marriage with the thirty-year-old they barely know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> "EASILY GIVE TOTAL VIRGINITY"? WHAT A SHREWD MEANS ON THIS FILM. It is possible to believe that young high school students are very confident and self-confident as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been, very often, teenagers feel very embarrassing and behave in clumsy way while experimenting in the adult world. <br /> <br /> NOT JUST NOTHING CAN YOU SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENT FROM YOUR EYES? Is sad. <br /> <br /> It can be believed that an expert doctor does not know the pungent smell of Stroptomycin - the malodorous fermenting by-product of busy terrestrial microbes - and does not detect that an insipid and insipid powder is false, but I do not think so . <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER "EXPERT" OPINION DESIGNED BY EXPERIENCE. DANDY. <br /> <br /> It can be believed that 30-year-old troublemakers can enter, and walk around, a public school in a social school and create problems, but I think school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent it. <br /> <br /> NOW BE A GOOD SPORT AND TELL US OF WHICH THE INSTITUTION DEVELOPS YOU. <br /> <br /> One last piece of crap, throughout Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends referred to them as the quartet. There is probably an explanation of why the FIVE were the FOUR, but since it was never detailed, each reference distracts from every scene. <br /> COURSE THERE IS PROBABLY AN EXPLANATION. GOOD WORK FIGUREWHERE OUT! NOW I AM GENEROUS AND IT WILL HELP YOU OUT OF THE MISERY: IT HAS ALSO BEEN TRANSLATED AS A GENERAL "FOURTH", THE WORD "ƒçETVORKA" HAS ANOTHER MEANING: IT IS A SPORTS TERM USED TO DESIGN A 4M OR 4W SETUP - A CREW MOVIE COMPOSED BY 5 PEOPLE: 4 ROWERS AND COXSWAIN. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't sound real to me. <br /> <br /> WE SHOULD EVERYONE LISTEN TO YOUR COMPETENT AND JURISDICTION OPINION. GUY.
