When I was a child, I watched it many times and I remember whistling the song "Happy Cat" quite often. All the songs are fantastic, and actually memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are locked without a real reason. The scenes and costumes are sumptuous, and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very nice, and he doesn't need stupid makeup, or a cat costume for the viewer who thinks he's a cat turned into a human being. And Jason Connery is so cute, like the timid and clumsy son of the miller, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and daring Princess Vera. This is a fun, entertaining feature film in which, unlike most fairy tales, the characters have personalities. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Corin pretend to drown; to the ball when everyone starts to dance a country dance, since it is "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, he dances on the table (he is also a good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she did when she was young, like pretending to be a miller's daughter. I recommend this film to children and parents, who love magic and fairy tales. And actually it's a movie that you can watch together, because it doesn't push adults to the wall.
