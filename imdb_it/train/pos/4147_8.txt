I don't think this film is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and thought it was so funny. I haven't laughed so much during a movie for a long time. I thought the whole cast did a great job. You'll find yourself laughing from the first moment until the last scene. I suspect that some viewers (especially those who take themselves too seriously) will be turned off by this brand of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater was bursting with laughter during the screening I went to, which makes me think that many people had fun and were happy to have a good time at the cinema, for a change. I can't wait to see it again! If you're in the mood for LOL, this is for you. Fun funny funny fun!
