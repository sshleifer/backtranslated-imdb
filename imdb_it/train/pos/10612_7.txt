It's poor, it's scary, it's indecent, but that's what makes it so fun. He has overcome the most melodramatic moments that are simply ridiculous. This movie is fantastic for teasing. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on three women who broadcast news, in a sense before mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't find a room to stay the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. It's disturbing in a Psycho-like way. And he offers to let them stay at his house. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as surprising as "The Unseen", which really brings this film. Most of the film is a bit boring, although discovering the truth of Ernest's family is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Just see this cast in these scenes that are worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr are pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> I consider the film an old jewel, hard to find and worthy of attention.
