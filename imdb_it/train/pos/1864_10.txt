I just saw Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What a fantastic, young and amazing film. This film is a must see for anyone dealing with overcoming abuse and child abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington stages an exceptional performance as does the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Notice Kleenex - Feeling good and in tears. The most heartbreaking moment is when he finally meets his mother, who was taken away at 2 months of age. And one of the bravest was when he stood up against his adoptive mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and I just wish I had known it years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
