At the end! A decent British comedy that doesn't focus on some mockney bank robbers or spun off a TV series. John Ivay's film is a story of psychoactive discoveries, dressed in biker clothes. The three protagonists are the gentle fools with a weakness for failure and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive and emotional trio of secondary plots to sew together the unbridled comedy. The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes the company moving with hilarious dialogues and some classic comic moments. I feel part of Withnail and I, partly American werewolf in London, and part of Quadraphenia (but only because of motorcycle gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, the lovely Phil Daniels rogue reminds you of Danny's Withnail dealer and me, with his academic approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great film, especially for those who have been delighted in psychoactive substances in the past, which will relate to many moments in the film. A personal favorite is the brilliant scene in the Welsh corner shop, buying munchies while tripping over 'shrooms. This delicate comedy warms the hearts of your heart and makes you laugh out loud. And you don't have to ride or even like them. But he will add it if you do. Brilliant.
