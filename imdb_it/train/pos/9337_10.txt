This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series are less accurate than the US ones, but this time the authors have hit the right target by creating a mix that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is fantastic, it has everything: fantastic plot, clever lines, funny, always well distributed, an incredible theatrical timing shown by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It's fun to see how things work in the field of justice in other countries compared to the United States and for once "feeling" the old European way of facing life. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for a well-made comedy that will be a must to see for years to come. Watching the series in German is super.
