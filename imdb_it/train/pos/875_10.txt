Well, what can I say I just watched this fantastic movie, when my nerves are still tinkling! Jacques Audiard, the director must make a good name in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not even Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tense and thrilling thriller that starts slowly with an intelligent character development and then starts to put tension into tension at a wonderful climax. Others have written about the plot, so I won't say any more about how everyone in this film plays their role perfectly, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and everything looks so real, no stupid shots, the fights when it happens is so believable , expressions, emotions, it's almost like I'm there as a spectator. Do yourself a favor, take the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn off the lights, remove the phone from the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
