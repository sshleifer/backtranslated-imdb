The film I'm going to review is a small television movie made in 1996 and starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels the pressure of having a father so dominant (Baldwin). However, when he meets a former cone called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Been Kissed") they "fall in love" with each other, but Jennifer has a different idea about where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill his parents, to protect their "love", but she just used it to get rid of her parents so she could be with Brad (David Lascher, Sabrina's future partner for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she wears the movie well using her friends and Nick so she can literally get by with the murder. The rest of the support cast works well and each of them keeps their own when they have time on the screen. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart began to play Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows he can act in my genres of film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the film has somehow dated it is still like one of his best works involving drama or thriller and I look forward to 'Nine Dead' which will be released in November because it shows of to be able to see how other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch it on the internet, so I suggest you try it.
