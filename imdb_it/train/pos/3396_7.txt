Very interesting. The big twist was not as big a shock as perhaps they had hoped for and was very dated, but it made my mind work. It really made me think of a world without vegetation or cattle and made me appreciate the world in which I live much more. Charlton Heston does a good job, like all supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film that was surprising. Sometimes the direction was missing and many settings and backgrounds required further explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent film. The main flaw I found is that I didn't want the film to end when it was done, I would have liked to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
