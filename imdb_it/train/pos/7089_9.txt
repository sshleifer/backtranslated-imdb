Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the science fiction genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger to bringing out this cinematic originality. An apocalyptic film that keeps you completely spellbound, 12 MONKEYS never gives up and you've guessed it all the time. The excellent use of the Philadelphia premises and Netherworld sets creates a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis escapes from his macho image and portrays a real madman who seems to be right, everything will happen. He is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you do) distort this guy's head so badly in time travel, it's no wonder he gets rid of it. It is sent to the First World War, shortly after sending the wrong year to find out how the twelve monkeys' army eliminates the annihilation of civilization as we know it. They finally got it right and in what is really an extraordinary script to match the performance, we can see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and a spooky Brad Pitt cross-referenced over 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stowe is as sensual and solid as the shrink that takes the risk and slowly begins to realize that Willis may not be as upset as he seems. A captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of "seeing each other" before, in another place or time. 12 MONKEYS is essentially about time and madness that futuristic people immerse themselves in it and in the times of the present, when murderers and a psychotic genius can alter the world. <br /> <br /> The meditative city of Philadelphia is a gothic darkness and background for Willis's difficult situation to complete his mission which is, against the usual Hollywood stereotype, NOT to save the world. It is gathering information. The film also plays tricks on the viewer, placing Willis in a new setting in a corner. This must have been an extremely difficult photo to make, but Gilliam seems to be the mistress of hard-boiled cinema. He even does a bit of humor reminiscent of other great works like TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the canvas of this man and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying image of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films. If you want sincere madness and an ironic tragedy, see 12 SCIMMIA. <br /> <br /> ASSESSMENT: 9 out of 10
