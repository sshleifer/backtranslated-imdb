Fred Olen Ray, action film, horror, science fiction and exploitation, proves he has talent as a director. Actor character William Smith is one of the best guys / villains in the industry. Treat the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression to Lee Van Cleef. It's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the film. As for the rest of the cast none of them really stood out. Ray did a great job directing this film, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B western on a scale of one to ten (ten are the best) to seven.
