I'm from "Christopher Reeve Generation", it's fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves makes a good chance to knock Chris is on top if he can barely make it. This doesn't stop me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot to offer. It has everything a film needs, a plot with beginning, center and end, plus all those parts are written intelligently. The film is edgy in both acting and plot, something of a film noir, but with pants. The story is both exciting and meaningful, this is a film with a message that is not too much a preacher. I'm still amazed that this was shot for 12 days, oh the glorious days of Hollywood, when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into the hell of development ... The film is polished and made by experts , directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for directing with speed and efficiency. He never lets the constraints of technology slow him down, in fact there are some creative things done to create the effect of flying, including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting up and traveling fast to make it look like we're seeing from Superman's point of view, even some close-ups of George in the works, and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an extra feature of the first season of the George Reeves television series. A DVD worthy of possessing in its own right, the inclusion of the original film as a whole, is the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood Today God Bless!
