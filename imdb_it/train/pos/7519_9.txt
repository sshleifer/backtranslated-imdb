THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines like the legendary pin-up queen of Bettie Page in a beautiful biographical film. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably best known for being chosen as The Next-It-Girl for a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite a notorious Vanity Fair cover story among media dubbing, but despite some co-starring roles here and there his stardom predicted seemed to sparkle less brightly so far. Here as the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is truly a rising star in the limelight. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born in Tennessee as a God-fearing and family-oriented girl who seemed to find herself the unjustified object of lust and affection as she grew up. A gang rape that is flashbacked is wisely not depicted graphically, nor is the subtle demonstration of one's father who has less than dignified designs for his relatives, which is important to understand how Page has managed to escape the possible nightmare life for a career as an actress who traveled to New York in the 1950s, when that was actually the time and place to be to take lighting in a bottle. What the Page did not realize is that, indeed, it would have been her when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful raven-haired girlfriend with a divine figure, Pagina is seen in Coney Island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take his picture that brings her posing in the basement and finally in the studies by Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who satisfy their kitsch but consider pornographic stills for a unique clientele: fetish types. > <br /> Although Page is rather naive, he is undeniably intelligent and knows that his body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that he has control - or at least remains in what is offered to him as he works in this he is not indecent and is enjoying himself in his portraits less and less dressed - until a Congress witch hunt looks for some scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> The talented director Mary Harron and her screenwriter collaborator Guinevere Turner ("An American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") simplify the biopic traps rather neatly and perhaps a bit too hasty to get to who really was Bettie Page even though they do justice in depicting an era of rigidity at its peak. Big thanks to the talented filmmaker Mott Hopfel for his languid black and white images and also the sprayed color segments reminiscent of Douglas Sirk's films of the era for his melodramatic mammals. Part of the feminist treatise and part of the American dream have filled the story of chugs accompanied by excellent performances by his ensemble, including comedian Bauer and Taylor as sprouted brothers and Harris who has a field day as a friend with a taste for wine and Chatter. It's fun to see Strathairn in some stunt casting as a senator in a righteous campaign after retracing the bulldog Edward R. Murrow in his last release, "Good Night and Good Luck", as opposed to the role of the table. > <br /> But it is a real talent for Mol as the uninhibited but profoundly moral and above all intelligent Bettie Page that lets its childish innocence shine through its bold nudity and now considered awful and delicate pose borderline-kitsch that they captured male fantasy for decades and is still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps in the world at large. Mol is perfect and incredibly remembers the subject of her portrait until her wise smile. Bettie's real Page was not involved in the project, but apparently gave her the blessing and continues to live a somewhat isolated life alluded to in the last moments of having found Jesus and discarding her "notorious" image once for all. A pity because this film strangely embraces the sensational decency permeated to its subject, which radiates for all in its naked splendor.
