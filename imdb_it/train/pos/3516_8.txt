She was excellent, Franchot was inevitably exaggerated (but she played similar parts in other films like "Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent but the film certainly "electrified". > <br /> * slight spoiler ahead *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was strangled in her films, but I seem to remember several other examples. I will avoid mentioning the killer, but I think it's necessarily obvious because of the "thriller" plot. <br /> <br /> A very well done but dated noir (for example: everyone smoked like crazy and the police were serial characters, and no dead body was ever shown, unlike today's blood clashes) done in the well-known tableaux format of the short period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
