Reese Witherspooon's first film. I love. The plot and the acting were first rate. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, a must see. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> The other cast members also do a great job. <br /> <br /> The film runs extremely well. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The man on the length of the moon is right. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think this film was excellent. I've seen it numerous times and enjoyed every vision.
