Since I saw him for the first time in the theater he was my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and I never get tired. The setting has a lot to do with it (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the plot is original and I liked how it used mountain people like heroes. There has not been a film that I can compare to this either. John Lithgow plays a cunning villain, but I like how he's completely out of his element: he has to follow Tucker and that's what makes him interesting. This is an action movie at its best. I don't think I'll see another one so funny. <br /> <br /> You don't need 50,000 shots fired to qualify as an action movie. He just needs to be fascinated, not shocked.
