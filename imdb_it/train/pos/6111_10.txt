I first discovered "My Tutor Friend" one or two years ago while watching TV. Before that, I had never seen any Korean movies in my life, so MTF was really the first Korean movie I ever saw. What a nice surprise! I was completely amused from start to finish and had a lot of fun laughing. His comic style is very different from that of Hong Kong comedy films (which I have been used to in my whole life and therefore also tired of it), to breathe fresh air in my experience of cinematic observation. I thought there were some pretty funny, witty and original MTF scenes and tricks. <br /> <br /> I saw MTF the second time a few days ago, and after seeing it once, the surprise / comic effect on me somewhat mitigated. This, however, did not in any way negatively affect my opinion of the film. Instead, something else came out - I was moved - the story of how two young, apparently "enemies" who are absolutely incompatible are thrown together, and how they gradually resolve their differences and begin to take care of each other without making themselves considering the feelings themselves, it reminds me of the long days of high school. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon ARE actually compatible since they both have something pure and genuine inside them, a quality that separates them from people like Ji Hoon's brazen girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two distinct parts: the first part deals with the "struggle" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon has passed his final test and Su Wan dances the provocative dance (according to Ji Hoon), things start to change. The pace slows and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes he cares for Su Wan more than he can ever imagine. Then the second part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, naturally leading to a happy ending, accompanied by a final showdown with the head of the band. <br /> <br /> One last comment. I find this a bit unbelievable - the fact that a self-proclaimed 21-year-old "bad boy" was ashamed to be almost naked in front of the bully girl who loses his 'cool' is just a little .. odd. I guess this shows that Ji Hoon is just a pure-hearted boy and that's not exactly what his appearance looks like. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) has a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of the 10 best favorite movies of all time.
