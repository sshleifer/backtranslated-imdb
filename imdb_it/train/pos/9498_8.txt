"Painting is seeing, so remembering better than what you saw." Thus says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter of The Light That Failed. The film is in the great old Hollywood style, played by Ronald Colman and a cast supporting skill that includes Ida Lupino in his first major role, the reliable actor character Dudley Digges (who also starred with Colman in Condemned.), And a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and the opening sequences of the film suggest that Dick will lose his sight He is blinded by the discharge of gunpowder while he and his childhood darling Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a gun . Later a wound while fighting in Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambition and does not reach his full potential to the point that his vision is leaving him. Enter bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and her self-destruction is set in motion. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays Colman very well. His bad cake reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well acted and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
