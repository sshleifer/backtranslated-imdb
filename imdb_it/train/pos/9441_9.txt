The creators of this beautiful film have done a fantastic job of involving you with the characters, because they suffered in this horrible trial. The horrible scene in the woods was so superb that you forgot that these men were only actors, playing parts. I've never been so immersed in a movie like this. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight have never been better on the screen, as have the beautiful performances of Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and although James Dickey, the man who wrote the book on which it is based, appeared only briefly. the film, like the sheriff of Aintry. It's a little creepy, and children, of course, should be protected, but this is a great dramatic cinema.
