It took me a while to watch this version, because unfortunately I don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store, just the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always on the edge with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, since they are not British, naturally have to put the accent, and for me it does not seem natural. Seems to be put. Sorry but I don't think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I couldn't get warm with any of the characters, but this version is warmer for the heart and more the kind of person I imagined was Emma. It is certainly the version I will return to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was no longer handsome, but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Williams). I've never warmed them up in the film version, but it's better interpreted in this version. Come to think of it, (besides Mr Knightley) all the characters are better interpreted, and much less over the top. Unfortunately both came out at the same time and Paltrow's version got more publicity. Too bad ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Congratulations to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a fan of Jane Austen, don't forget to watch this.
