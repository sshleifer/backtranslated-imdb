This is the first and only feature film by Paul F. Ryan. He hasn't done anything since. However, he managed to get an extraordinary cast to represent the characters in his story. I don't know when or why the idea emerged in his head, but Ryan wrote a screenplay that later became his direct movie, "Home room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps carries the film on his shoulders like Alicia, a troubled girl; those that we always see in television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in his pocket, a strange look and eerie eyes (with makeup, of course). An event occurred in his school; a shot. Some students died and she saw everything. Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is now investigating the case and, as expected, Alicia is suspected. But the shot is only the genesis; the film is not about filming. <br /> <br /> Lying in bed in a hospital room is Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen). She is one of the hospital survivors. The script establishes a link between them, from the school principal (James Pickens Jr). He's helping all the students recover from the event, but Alicia doesn't seem to care. She is isolated. Then the principal punishes her; he needs to visit Deanna every day until five. Then the film begins. <br /> <br /> I can't even describe how wonderfully written I think the film is. I can identify myself with the characters and the situations in which they live; I like reality. These things could happen to anyone. And the things they say are totally understandable. They are growing up and are trying to deal with things they have not experienced; they are doing their best. Without knowing it, Alicia (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia in front of her) are starting a journey that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high school. <br /> <br /> The director guides Christensen and Philipps through their roles very well. Look at the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and with simple thoughts; no complexity in his mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers, she asks, "Who brought them?" "Many people," replies Deanna; although a few days later we learn that they come from his parents, who come every week. The parental figures are all well represented, but they are not as important as the characters of their children. Deanna is alone. Alicia looks mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking about. But after two days of visiting, he finds himself returning to the hospital every day; even sleep in Deanna's room all night. When they both have a fight later, I think Deanna says, "Why do you keep coming back?" Alicia is also alone. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, without ruining it, is a bit disappointing; it's something I wasn't waiting for. Eliminate part of the film's strength. Revelation is totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax that the film could have had. However it was an excellent script; and an excellent direction. A damn good movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Erika Christensen, this was the role she needed to fly higher. His role in "Traffic" was impressive, but this was the big step; the main role. Perhaps not many have had the chance to see it in this film, and it's a shame. Since then he has not made a false move. It even went out with good performances in terrible movies. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who has shown himself to be very promising in this film (that transformation), does not have many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> The same as I say about Paul F. Ryan (in directing, of curse), and I expect him to be sitting in his computer now finishing his new script; I'm waiting for your next movie. I hope the best for all of them.
