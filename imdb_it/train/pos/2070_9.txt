Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow perform first-rate shows in their respective roles; Mrs. Phillips has the less than enviable task of trying to make a TV movie more spicy (twenty-five years ago), providing "sexual interest" in a film otherwise without sex. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; a 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, put in front of a camera and given a workout that will leave the observer panting, breathless and holding the edge of the seat with a breathless wait. <br /> <br /> The action the scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog boxes are a bit boring) that make the evening enjoyable. Here's how all "car films" should be made. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this in the late movie channel; it's worth losing your sleep.
