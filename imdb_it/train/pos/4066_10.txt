Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than all of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings the joy of storytelling to the public. It's the kind of film that makes a child feel again; it's just magic It's a crime that it took so long before it was released in the United States, but now that's here, take a look! And stick to the original language; dub has changed my impressions of the characters in some way, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or a book, anything.) <br /> <br /> I give a ten / ten.
