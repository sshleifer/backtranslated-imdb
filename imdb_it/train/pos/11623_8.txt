(You will understand what I mean after seeing the red eyes ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, Red Eye was a better thriller than expected. It starts to slow down and slowly builds up. But when it's done, it's a thumper! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to define exactly what makes this thriller ... as exciting as I found it. Except that, to put it simply, the director did a job worthy of involving you in the action of what would otherwise have been a thrilling storyline. I preferred to tend to forget that I was watching a movie. This says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are the "closeness" of the victim and the villain ... and over time, you begin to really relate to the victim. Poor 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but it's pretty good!
