Greetings still from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 apparently unrelated cartoons on love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that requires a couple of segments to fit like a viewer. We are so used to the development of the character in a 2-hour movie, it's a bit disarming that this happens in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 stories of love / relationship in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city. Of course, some rise better than others and some go to comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including: The Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many familiar faces also make appearances: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments includes a mime, and then another mime and the nerd, but a happy young son of the two Mimes. Other key roles are the red trench, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. Don't miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") like Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the segments makes this interesting to watch, but as a film it cannot be called grandiose. Yet it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for frequent movie goers.
