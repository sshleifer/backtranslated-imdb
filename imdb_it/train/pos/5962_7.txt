I saw a string of "horrors of the 80s" over the years, from trash like "Terror on Tour" to incredibly fun gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2." Somehow I managed to keep putting this out, which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well received. Well, in the end I reached it and it is easily the best of this subgenre for the most part horrible (but almost always appealing!). The plot (which was practically raised in the movie "Black Roses") concerns a rigged misfit named Eddie, whose ridicule by everyone in his school for his musical tastes. He loves the metal of the 80s, in particular his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late great Tony Fields.) After Sammi was killed, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gave him the final recording of Sammi. Once Eddie plays the disc backwards, he finds that it is a little harder, and bad things start to happen to those who taunt him. Is Sammi's music possessed? "Trick or treat" is well done and a real treat. The special effects are fantastic, even if they have the typical laser beams of the 80s. I grew up in the 80s and, although I wasn't a fan of heavy metal, I remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards while listening to the sounds of Satan worship. Haha! I also remember being told by my older brothers and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy loved Satan, so it's very funny to see them both making cameos as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this movie as a child! While the film seems to mock the popular connection in the 1980s between the alleged devil cult and heavy metal, the viewer never really discovers why Sammi Curr returned from death creating devastation and killing anyone who gets in his way. This is the weakest point in the film, but if you can ignore it, it's very funny.
