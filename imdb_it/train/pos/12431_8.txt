Ok, honestly, I saw the previews of this film and I thought to myself, what are the producers thinking? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had that kind of chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor matched Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he interpreted the psycho very well, in contrast to David's calm offering of life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and development of the character. I gave him 8 stars.
