If you're a fan, you'll probably like it. If you don't know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, this is not the movie to start with. It's very cute, silly, girls are hot, and it's fun to watch. There is no type of sex until the end of the 45-minute movie, but the score is a make-up artist and the plot is not at all boring. Misty Mundae's makeup is ugly in this film and her hair is in clumsy braids, so it's not as exciting in this as it is in others. But her panties in this are pretty pretty (you just have to watch the movie to not look really weird). If you like this, you'll probably like "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a little more sexually graphic). If you'd rather watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, more horror / exploit-based (but less budget) movies, check out the Factory 2000 website.
