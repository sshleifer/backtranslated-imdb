I recently found a copy for $ 5 at a video store and took it with enthusiasm. While the music and (obviously) the graphics are not up to the standards of my favorite series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I'm still entranced by a segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ice" . The music is brilliant and the emotions seem real. The clip on Odyssey's website has no history or music, unfortunately.
