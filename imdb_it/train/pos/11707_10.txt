I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, even though it didn't have any special effects, the acting was really good. And he still has the same message for today, even if the technology has changed, maybe they should do a remake of this film, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also liked the music of the film, Larry Norman was an excellent composer during that time, although now most of Christian music is now cult and music praise. I was always curious to know what happened to Patty after the series ended? Did you continue to make other films, did you eventually get married and raise a family? I would like to have an update.
