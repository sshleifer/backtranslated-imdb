Antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece, this time on the other side of the "Blow up" Atlantic. But it was not the success with critics and young people like the first. Why? Perhaps because it was a European vision of America full of clich√©s that did not work then and did not age well. (In the beginning the revolutionary students are embarrassing.) <br /> <br /> Maybe when it was published, the big hit movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated. If it had been published a year before perhaps the hippes in the deserts would have seemed fresh ... It is a very interesting film, very well shot with some brilliant scenes of Antonionian inspiration, like love in the desert, the immobility of the desert villa and the explosive end ... That the two protagonists were not helpful. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would have been much better with real actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite funny and moving, sometimes, you don't know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting document of the late sixties definitely deserves a look for photography and the soundtrack ....
