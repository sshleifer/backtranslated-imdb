What can be said of the convincing performance of Tara Fitzgerald? It is absolutely credible as Mrs. Graham's wound, hardened by experience, sharp and willful, but not immune to Mr. Markham's passionate attention. Through every mischievous look and every light, every glimmer of discernment in his eyes and facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. It is the strength of passion and hope that will restore Elena's wounded spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect display of the unreformable thief. Yet despite all he has done, there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to interpret the hypocrite in the end; he is at least aware of his shortcomings and how they brought his ruin. Helen's attempt to save her soul - after leaving it and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, however mistaken, for how sinful the person could be. Markham's constancy can therefore be seen as his reward for his faith and his unyielding moral character. Although the ideas of morality so strongly presented in Tenant seem to be outdated by today's standards, the plot is imbued with integrity, passion and conviction that still have an impact. The tenant is much more credible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that does justice to the novel. I highly recommend seeing it!
