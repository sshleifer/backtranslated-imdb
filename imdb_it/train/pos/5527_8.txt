There is perhaps a special reason why The Fox and the Child has struck a special note in my heart. Having just said goodbye to my new girlfriend - oh ... one day - for an unknown period of time, I was a bit overwhelmed by different emotions and I was suffering from the relapses from putting the brave face that she needed to see. /> <br /> I watched some movies and TV series, but my interest started from what I was leaving behind what's out there and what I haven't seen. For this, I have to thank this film. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand, I was sure I would have liked it anyway. But I didn't like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical mastery is astounding. How did they do it? How did they catch the animals the way they did ?? It's simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good and while the ending is oh so French and ambiguous, it is a happy / sad. Again, it took me a little off guard. As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was hard while he was on a plane full of people I would see for the next 15 hours! Maybe it's because the ending made me think back to what I left. <br /> <br /> But for those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And this is life. Of course, there are those things you love and feel comfortable around ... but the great outdoors contains many mysteries. So next time I see something out of the ordinary while I'm in the open; I intend to explore it, observe it and embrace it. This is exactly what happens in this movie and this is exactly what you should do with this damn good movie / even with nature. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Two months have passed since the plane trip. We still don't know when we'll meet again, but we'll do it.
