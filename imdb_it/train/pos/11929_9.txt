A piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family movie is one of the bargains. <br /> <br /> At the time, in 1994, this film contained the record for the premiere of the biggest film in the history of cinema (and could continue to be held). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the "Angels" of the original film who "persecuted" the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake they "haunt" the Angels of California. <br /> <br /> However, the premiere was held in the long stage of Three Rivers, which was the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers of the time (the Pirates are now hosted in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere was projected on a five-story cinema screen inside the stadium and held (and could even continue to contain) the disc for the world's largest premiere of the story, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all present at the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
