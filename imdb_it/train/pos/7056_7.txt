The sequel to the ever-popular Cinderella story reminded me a little of what they did with one of the Beauty & the Beast movies. They are basically three stories on 1. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! It's so cute!), And Lucifer is fantastic (as usual). I also liked some of the new characters (Pom Pom was adorable and I liked Prudence). However, the plot was a bit limited, but still very pretty. So, vote 7/10.
