Like most off You Might out of Star Wars: Return Off The Jedi you may know it's a good movie, but how could you have seen them in video They M | could have a party at the end and they just finished the movie with the party with no spirits or anything but on the original (Live TV) When they party But before you say more when Ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or star of death They see him disappear and Yoda dies from an old age or an internal disease But because Luke killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker) when everybody is having fun in the end when Luke or someone interrupts the spirits Ben and Yoda stands out for him and he smiles while another spirit appears his Darth Vader is but not like A Sith As The Old Usual He goes off and starts smiling with Ben and Yoda I think he made the movie a bit interesting But the producers or anyone should have made a spirit out of Padme and Mace Windu and other Jedis who were killed with Younglings Under Ci arms in th and back to earth
