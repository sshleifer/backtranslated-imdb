How I did it: when I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I have to say that I've never seen anything like it and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS, and years later on DVD, I was part of Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was fantastic and really worth watching. He had a lot of explosive action that will leave you breathless. And, of course, the thematic songs "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions "were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: my favorite characters on the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und , Noin and Zech. My favorite Gundams on the show that I liked the most are Wing Zero, and Epyon, and of course the Altron, and Deathscythe I, and II. <br /> <br /> Meaning of the show: this series also tells us that in real life wars are very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose, but even peace can be difficult to achieve, and I believe that Gundam pilots are doing the right thing, and trying to achieve world peace . <br /> <br /> But anyway, this show is really the best of the best, so in closing this review, after seeing this show, see the movie Endless Waltz.
