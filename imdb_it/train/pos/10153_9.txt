I took this film at a test screening. I was very surprised to find a really sweet and funny story. Well acted. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male protagonist was wonderful. Very funny movie It takes place in the best locations in New York. It made me want to go there. I just saw "Got the mail" I thought "I had to be yourself" was a much better story. Fresher. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. I think it will go well Public I've seen it with loved one. A precise tip!
