When I was a child it was Lex Barker's time like Tarzan. I have often heard from elderly people that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I would not have understood why since I saw a couple of Weismuller films in the character and I thought he was a bit out of shape. It wasn't after many years that I came across "Tarzan and his companion", and then I understood. Weismuller is fit in this picture and has the sturdy presence and looks that the character requires not equaled by other Tarzians like Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> As for this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, authoritarian, active and "uninhibited" woman, as Jane anticipates the times in which she was made the film (Tarzan pushes her into a naked pond as she is amused, one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and even if she doesn't kiss him again she lets him do it for a while and doesn't make a big problem of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the "Janes" to come as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all played with women who were too vulnerable and too vulnerable, making it hard to believe that they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. <br /> <br /> The glittering personality of O'Sullivan's character steals the show from Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. Another highlight of the film is the secondary role of Cheeta and not as the main protagonist of Tarzan's latest images, where he often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and His Mate" is a refined product of its kind (Tarzan film) and perhaps the best, although I must admit that I also liked "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) made with a higher budget and a supportive cast (and despite the just acceptable Gordon Scott in the lead role with his perfect "all-gym" look that doesn't fit a rustic monkey man. <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
