I saw this movie in the worst of circumstances. I had already lost 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I didn't know what I was watching, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but I was quickly riveted by the performance of the lead actress who played a young woman that the child had been kidnapped. The premise started to turn and I didn't see it coming and for the credits I climbed on the flight guide to understand what I had just seen. It turns out that I was late discovering Do-yeon Jeon who had won the best actress at Cannes for the role. I don't know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to find out more.
