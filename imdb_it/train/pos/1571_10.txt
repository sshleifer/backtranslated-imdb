Not since Spongebob Squarepants saw a bigger cartoon on TV. The colors are fantastic, the voices could not be better, the characters are so original, fantastic and fantastic. I hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. Hope the Season DVD will be released soon !!! I love cartoons like this and I hope more people tune in to see this great cartoon. It is very difficult to find the DVD of the season, so if someone finds a store that sells it, please let me know. The only Catscratch market available on Nick Shop is a beautiful shirt, but very very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who doesn't? You'll love Catscratch too!
