Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. With the help of hindsight, Crowe's script is much narrower and more detailed than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should have the merit of having thought of the story first, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved the situation, albeit slightly. Note that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost all of the lead in VANILLA SKY. This is what I mean by "more exaggerated".
