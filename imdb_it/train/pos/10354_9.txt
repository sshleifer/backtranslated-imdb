A CRY IN THE DARK <br /> <br /> A CRY IN THE DARK was a film I expected would offer a phenomenal performance by Meryl Streep and a solid, if not trivial, film. This assumption derives from the fact that, apart from the nomination of the best actress of Streep, the film received little attention from important awarding groups. <br /> <br /> I had not foreseen that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a compelling drama, well-built at every level If you ask me, this is an underrated classic. <br /> <br /> The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience get into Chamberlain at a relaxed pace and really realizes that, in the center, I am an incredibly loving and simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture a family on vacation that gives a looming sense of the coming tragedy, while also showing the careful bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain take care of their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo Took My Baby!" it has somehow become a punch line these days, the film never even comes close to ridicule. Azaria's actual death is captured horribly. It's subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on Chamberlain's continuing struggle to prove their innocence to the press and court, which suspects Lindy of the murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is clear from the start that they are innocent makes the tests tense even more compelling. As a member of the public, I was completely invested in Chamberlain's difficult situation ... and I was genuinely irritated, hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was not nice at all, but they always had good reasons to keep their opinions. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film is very deep and perfectly captures the central element that makes this film so different from other court dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill ... and they offer in every way. For me, this is one of the best (if not the number 1) of Meryl Streep. Despite all her mastery of different accents (which of course are really impressive), Streep never loses the heart and soul of her characters. I find this one of Streep's subtlest exhibits, and she hits him outside the park. And Neill, an actor who has never struck me as well as being charismatic and attractive in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's best work to date. It is a pity that it was not recognized by the Academy with a Best Actor nomination corresponding to that of Streep ... b / c the two are having fun with one another. <br /> <br /> More emotionally engaging than most movies, and also incredibly suspenseful ... A CRY IN THE DARK has far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend to people who only know the movie like the movie in which Meryl screams "The dingo has taken my baby!" watch the movie and see how much more there is in A CRY IN THE DARK then that line. <br /> <br /> ...
