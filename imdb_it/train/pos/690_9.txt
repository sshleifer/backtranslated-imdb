I had no idea what this movie was or even knew it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled when I was looking for other movies that watched Dominic Monaghan. I thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a sleeper and what his mind could go through in the hours they spend awake when the rest of the world sleeps around them, it was an interesting film and a good part of the film was played Dom ....... I believe that even if you can't buy this film anywhere (well, I've never seen it anywhere) you have to see it if you get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us who can't sleep and who have to suffer night after night of not being able to sleep or only get 1 hour of sleep every night, so overall it was an interesting film of good substance.
