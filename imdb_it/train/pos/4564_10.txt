If ever there was an inspiring story that could move anyone, disabled or not, to persevere despite the difficulties and make it (even when "doing" it as an expression, one's own, can have a wide anchorage that is a truth ultimately personal) This is my left foot. It is a difficult film to look at sometimes: to see the less tranquil aspects of Christy Brown's personality emerge in two key scenes: one in which the sister declares to be pregnant and about to get married while her father has a bad reaction, and to a dinner table when the woman who achieved her goal, made him able to communicate effectively, now announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) that he is about to marry another man - it's tough. Very, very difficult. Even more so because it is a man who cannot react to these events as a result and can express himself only in the only way he knows: through screams, squeals and swearing to injure himself. However, this is not a story of anxiety and family dysfunction even when there is a good deal of what the autobiographical account provides, but that of a man who overcomes his severe disability, becoming a functioning human being and a strength to do not underestimate the art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful and unforgettable performance as Christy Brown, imperfect but tenacious, and Brenda Fricker did it for her supporting role as Brown's solid mother.
