Okay, so the first few seasons took some time to get on with the special effects, but from the beginning Hidden Frontier always gave good stories and performances, and he was always willing to make mistakes. They advise people to see the most recent episodes first, so that they can see how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The cast has a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors who leave their mark on the show and with fans also attests to the show, as the narrative lines become ever stronger. The show pushed barriers with its various narrative lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have wrinkled some people the wrong way, but that's what Star Trek is and it was all. It represents these narrative lines in an intelligent and emotional way, treating them with subtlety and fluidity. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some characters from the Trek story, but they did them justice - characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, widely underutilized on the show, have had a renaissance in the New Frontier books, but they have lost their sizzle after a while, when Peter David, more towards the wild fantasy against serious science fiction, and HF shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and can get to know the people involved. They release bloopers for each episode, so fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people who do it in their spare time, with a dedication that would make many professional actors be shocked by shock! <br /> <br /> What this series, which is ending after 7 years, has reached such a limited number of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. HF will live long after it ends, as long as people continue to enjoy the reason it started in the first place.
