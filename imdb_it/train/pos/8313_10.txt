First of all, I think the comment below is unworthy for a site like this. Obviously you have no taste and do not respect the taste of others. Not to give you a history lesson, but I think it's necessary. The black actors out there are just, if not more, successful like others. If you are not part of the "black" race, you cannot understand the quality, creativity and vibrantness of old films like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Since you are unfortunately not Black, you do not have the pleasure of trying what we feel when we look at these classics, so for this you have to keep your mouth shut and stay true to your race that doesn't dance. Thank you.
