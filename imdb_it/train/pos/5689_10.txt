First of all, this is a review of the two sets of records that have been associated with the DVD rental "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> The two films included in the rental, "Wonderland" and the Johnny Wadd documentary, completely erase the myth created by "Boogie Nights". That myth was that the characters involved in the adult movie were much more than meager lowlifes who would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything other than obnoxious egocentric whining. This is incredibly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" made for the fable of "The Godfather" and most of the rest of the tradition of gangster romance. <br /> <br /> Now, what irritated me the most about watching these films, and probably bothering anyone who saw and enjoyed "Boogie Nights", is how silly and credulous supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no ransom. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused someone close to him, he was totally consumed by his search for self-gratification, and he was undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal murders of Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film lays bare the great lying that "Boogie Nights" was, and reinforces, Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry. This should be required for viewing, both features of the "Wonderland" DVD, for anyone who has had positive views on the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
