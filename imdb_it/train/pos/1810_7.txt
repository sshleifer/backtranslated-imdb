I can understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't. For me, though, I like it a lot, even though I've noticed some beautiful pieces, and not such impressive pieces. The animation was actually excellent, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best was Anne-Marie, voiced by Judith Barsi. (I was physically ill when I read what had happened to her) Furthermore, Carface is a very convincing villain, particularly voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback. (I particularly loved "The Morons are surrounded by Morons") and together with Rasputin and Warren T. Rat is probably the most memorable of all the villains of Don Bluth. Only Charlie and Itchy lacked the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Part of the film is very disturbing, like "You can never go back" by Annabelle, which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some pieces that I didn't like so much. History had a tendency to become clumsy and fuzzy, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. In addition, there were dark scenes that young children would find unsettling, but the ending is very touching. However the biggest flaw was the rather insipid songs and the way they were sung. Not one of them in particular stands out, except "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", and Burt Reynolds does not sing and Dom DeLuise sang much better. All in all, a watchable movie, which could have been more, but it is certainly memorable, and I would certainly watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
