This film came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, actually I saw both the Simpsons and Futurama and in both there is a mention, so I thought "what the hell". The film brings home a "what if's" that makes you realize how lucky we are in this day and age when we take simple things like soap and water for granted. Interesting though that in the year 2022 the men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor! Nice that the people in charge didn't load the film too much with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. Some nice looking "furniture", once you understand what it means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
