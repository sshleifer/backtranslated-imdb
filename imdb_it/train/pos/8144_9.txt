Having seen both "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that, while similar, both films are really worth seeing. There will be many times in "Fear" that will drive you crazy. It is no wonder that both films have followed such a great cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you have to, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
