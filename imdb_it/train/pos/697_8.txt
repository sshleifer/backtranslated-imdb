This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a low budget, it was done well; as an insomnia myself, I can sympathize with the main character, even though my sleep problems have never been so intense or disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well directed, well acted, of a subject that I have not seen much in theaters, lighting and the perfect setting for the setting of the film. There are few obvious goofs, but they can be understood; you'll see after seeing the movie. The film is very personal and worth looking at twice. No film is flawless, but a version of Hollywood could not make history better. all in all, 8/10.
