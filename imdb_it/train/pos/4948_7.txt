This is a beautifully made simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different from what they get. The premise is simple: a famous unidentified actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to look for an upcoming role by visiting a store and looking at people. He takes particular interest in the cashier in the "10 objects or less" lane (Paz Vega), which finds a loving, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors have fun with each other and bring solid dimension to the characters in what is a character study. Not a conventional study; Each of them represents whole worlds. The life of the cashier is mired in a hard and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantastic existence that he can't perform simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He readily admits that he is making a face when he talks to people, and the research point of real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor is inspired by real people for his work; we also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him" and refer to how he inspired them with his film roles. <br /> <br /> The cashier's favorite song "Al Pasar la Barca", about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and instead prefers to pay (ie: do an honest job) for the boat ride, not could have been chosen better. Parallel to the character Vega, the only employee of the store with a brain or ambition, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (This is a real aspiration, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It is a strange film, probably made with little money. If you don't mind the slow pace and a "talking" approach, this movie will entertain you. The characters are perfectly contrasted and effective acting makes them appealing. A nice watch.
