This film is a fantastic film. In my opinion everything was top notch from acting to directing. I know that Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video if not on DVD. That being the case, why isn't this? A friend recorded me from TCM for me, but seeing it on DVD would be great. For special features they could have said that a sea historian talks about the battle and if Schmid's wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed. Anyway, this is a fantastic film and I highly recommend it. If you hope, it will never be colored. In my opinion, the coloring would only ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was quite realistic until 1945, the film was going. Mr. Garfield did a great job portraying Mr. Schmid. Some actors may have been tempted to disrupt Mr. Schmid's disability part, but I feel he understood it. I sincerely hope that they will come out one day with this DVD movie as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War II.
