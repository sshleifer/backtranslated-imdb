This film is chock-full of horror movie tributes: chained lunatics, premeditated murders, a mad (vaguely lesbian) scientist with an even crazier father wearing a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, ghostly castles, werewolves (male and female), adultery, lovers killed, Tibetan mystics, the half-man / half plant victim of some nameless experiment, plundering of tombs, mental control, walled bodies, a car accident on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armor - all this, all topped off with an incredibly horrible soundtrack and some of Foley's worst work ever made. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even by the Spanish dubbed horror film standards) and some modifications are just bizarre. In a scene in which the protagonist of the evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the damn nicknames: "It's fantastic, I don't understand, explain to me again how ...". movie, there is a sudden missing shoulder of the girl's thighs as she rises from the bed for no apparent reason to cover a cut in the "evil scientist" "Mwahaha! All your werewolves belong to mine!" speech. However, because they went to annoyance, I don't know because there are a lot of other shocking jumps everywhere - even taking into account the atrocious pan and scan of the print I saw. <br /> <br /> The Director was, according to an interview with the star, drunk for most of the filming and the film seems. It's an inconsistent mess. It is made even more inconsistent by the inclusion of werewolf scenes taken from a different film The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, with the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make-up) a word in Spanish for "Continuity"?) and more stuffing than another actor in the wolf's robe who enjoys himself for a long time. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad that varies almost by chance from the house full of orchestral music, to Bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. (Thinking about it, it may not have been a duet, it may have been a solo: the piano part was so simple that it could be chosen with one hand while the player beat the gong with the other.) /> <br /> This It is one of the worst trance states that led the bad films of the year so far for me. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and perversion will turn against you!" How beautiful. <br /> <br /> Favorite shot: the lover, discovering his killed girlfriend, dropping the candle in a demonstration of a cartoon surprise. Rank the amateur director there.
