I've always enjoyed watching it when it came to television in prime time every year in the 1960s. It's a typical epic Hollywood story, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but then, it's a fun movie and a good movie. Cecil B. DeMille is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film at the end of his life. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who played the supporting role of Beluche in the 1938 film, is the director in his debut directing and singing the swan, as he had never directed a film before and never again. DeMille brought together a crew that had recently worked on its 10 Commandments to help Quinn take it out, including longtime producer / actor DeMille, Henry Wilcoxon, who oversaw the project. The 10 commandments also include screenwriter Jesse Lasky, director of photography Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, second unit director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, the costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume designer received the Oscar nomination for The Buccaneer. An exceptional cast here from the DeMille team headed by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future general president Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In a little over two hours he drags himself in some places but compensates with some excellent battle scenes. I would give a 7.5 out of 10.
