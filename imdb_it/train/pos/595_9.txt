When John Wayne filmed his story of the Alamo, he had built a complete set of the Alamo in the city of Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and rather the tourist attraction. As long as this is valid, we will have a set for Alamo's future screen interpretations. One of these with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was made in this century. <br /> <br /> But I would say The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best Alamo story I have ever seen. John Wayne's film is good if it is overwhelmed, but it's a John Wayne film with the story redone to fill the parameters of John Wayne's character. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett and provides an excellent interpretation of the frontier character he was. <br /> <br /> It is much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on Alamo than Wayne's film and after reading the years of the book I can attest to it. Tinkle's book is listed as the source of both films, but Tinkle was alive when Wayne's film was finished and he wasn't happy with the result. Alec Baldwin was about the right age for the young William Barrett Travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who happened to be a slave owner. In the past, nobody has seen the ironic contradiction in this. One thing that was not explored and was not Travis's overactive sexual drive. He was the Casanova of the southwest, he also kept a salacious diary of his lustful conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets the plaster is Jim Bowie, played here by James Arness. He was an Alamo hero, of course, but his first Alamo career was that of a rogue. He was a smuggler, a slave merchant, a highly respected swindler who sold land to which he had a questionable title. But his heroic death has certainly redeemed him. No trace of this is in the portrait of Arness nor in anyone else who has seen of Bowie on the screen. And of course he designed the Bowie knife, made to his specifications. That man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main strength of The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is a portrait of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, the president of Mexico who personally presents himself to break down the rebellion raised by the North Americans they settled in Texas for the Mexican invitation. Unfortunately those Americans arrived with some pre-conceived notions of freedom that had not reached the south, at least the freedom for whites. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna who remains an even more controversial figure in the history of Mexico. He was also rather rascal, but it was the best Mexico produced until a true reformer named Benito Juarez arrived. <br /> <br /> This film was the goodbye of Lorne Greene who appears briefly as General Sam Houston. Greene is not really my idea of ​​Houston, he was really too old for the part, Houston was in his forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him, Greene does a good job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic tale of The Alamo, see in any case the version of John Wayne, but for historical content I highly recommend this film.
