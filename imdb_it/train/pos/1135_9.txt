I saw it for the first time at the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really in the movie that made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast of characters, many big names in it, some of which weren't as recognized as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or loved them in other movies, to add them to your list of viewers. Some scenes actually remind me of the kind of well-made comedy like in The Birdcage or even The Clue, a kind of strange seemingly spontaneous comedy, with some really professional deliveries from these beloved actors. The film did a great job in giving you some ideas, maybe even very realistic, in the culture of a daytime soap.
