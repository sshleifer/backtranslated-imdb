I must be 100% honest with your fellow IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a very long time just because of the poster. Does Charlotte Gainsbourg not seem very sexy and charming that way? I'm in love with that woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should offer expectations to those who love all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> Even if I disagree with another IMDb user, who says the film is overrated; I have to admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the lack of screen chemistry among the main characters. There is not a single scene prior to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of "romance" or even a clue to suggest that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only scene in which they both share a moment is tremendously embarrassing (when both are on the couch) and does not help the audience understand a possible love interest. I didn't buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> However, the film offers very funny moments and has a strong dialogue that supports such a naive premise. I mean naively that it would be very difficult to make such a rude to a 43-year-old man these days. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a fun situation. Furthermore, humor is versatile. There are moments involving S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, fun situations involving family women, and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she is by far the reason to watch the movie. It's fun, sexy, looks very thin and thin, and proves to be a versatile and talented actress who manages to give comedy and drama in all its brilliance. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a good actor and gives a lot of decent performance. I think the supporting cast does what it can. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give the film a dynamic look. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this type of cinema should be satisfied after the credits. It is a good example of feeling good at the cinema.
