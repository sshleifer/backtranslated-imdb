Originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely interested in local history, this film offers a great vintage vision of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes from the center, a train station that no longer exists, the 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the northeast part of the city. Good shots of the old row houses as they appeared then. The film becomes a bit "talkative" at times - making the viewer briefly lose interest ... but the overall plot is solid and very moving. Anyone who has enjoyed this film should also try to see the film "Bright Victory", also with local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. Since then the military hospital has become a university campus. None of these films is in any format and I can't imagine why. I have them both on VHS from home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to other history buffs out there in my area!
