God! Zorro was the subject of many films like Tarzan and probably had more actors in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This serial is one of my personal favorites and, as previously stated, is one of the 5 best audio serials. Strangely, this is a production that came out in that shed of 1939. * At the time of this production in '39, Zorro was well known as a literary and film character (Pulp). The film opens with a small footnote on the history of Mexico's struggle for freedom from the government of a European monarchy, especially Spain. History invites confrontation with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses its attention on the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its "Council". It was addressed by Benito Juarez ** on the report of the gold mine with the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must arrive in Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco Uncle to Diego Vega, says he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for gold convoys. A thug from the Don del Oro mob, stages an 'insult' to himself and challenges Don Francisco to a duel with swords, Don Frasncisco to make his way. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the masked swordsman dressed in dark seems to fight with the sword and after having engraved the "Z" mark on the villain's face, sends it to the afterlife. Don Francisco declares with his last breath to his pupil Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew of the city of Los Angeles, and also tries to tell the true identity of Don del Oro, but expires before completing the declaration. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception for Diego at the Hacienda of Don Francisco, where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister (also department of Don Francisco) with his timid act "A FOP !!", he declares. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, Diego and Ramon slips away to join a volunteer meeting.When they ask "who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon declares "Zorro, we are Zorro's Fighting Legion!" Well, there is a great battle with the Legion now all dressed in gray, with masks and cloaks, which protects the gold train, so Zorro seems int set in an artificial avalanche destined for the convoy, when, well, the end of the Cliffhanger chapter one is known. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for a chapter, but like most other serials, the opening one is longer and has a lot of reasons to prepare the plot. Let's just say that there are 11 full, well-made, action-packed chapters that follow. <br /> <br /> The ZORRO COMBAT LEGEND has all the elements that made the cliffhanger top action. We have an unknown evil leader who is stirring up problems between different groups. There are a number of suspicions about who was really behind the mask of 'Don del Oro'. We have had soldiers, renegade whites, hostile Indians and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In short, it is safe to say that there is everything you could want, and then some, in this series. And, incidentally, they wisely choose not to let the actors influence Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> What is it about here that makes ZFL stand out from the others? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score that plays and emphasizes drama and on-screen action. The opening theme also appears in a version of flamenco guitar at the Cantina in the first chapter. This is probably the only time when such a highly specialized innovation appears in the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Yet there is another feature that really puts the Fighting Legion saga ahead of everyone else. That is, the film has not only a heroic musical theme, but also sports texts, yes, the Legionaries sing! We hear them singing in the headlines and in several chapters! It works really well and adds the feelings we feel from the vision. <br /> <br /> When the series was first shown on our local television (circa 1955), the whole band immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as belonging to 'Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the series TV. Mr. Hadley had a very particular and profound voice. *** He also managed the role very well. His costume and especially the elongated mask seemed very beautiful and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small mistake. A sort of minor anachronism occurs when Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) addresses the Council of San Mendelito, since Juarez was about 18 years old at the time (1824) and, although he was perhaps perhaps the greatest figure in the history of Mexico, surely he had not yet achieved such prominence. His inclusion in history was probably to cash in on Warner Brothers' release of JUAREZ that year, with Paul Muni in the title role. <br /> <br /> It's not just my choice between the 5 best serial sounds, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of the great crop of high-flying films of that year, what with GONE WITH THE WIND, MR. SMITH GO TO WASHINGTON, THE CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE WIZARD OF OZ, OF MICE AND MEN, A MILION IN PI, ZENOBIA, WE WANT OUR MUMMY all counted between the production of that year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez did not grow up in any country until 1850, some 25 years later. Furthermore, political subdivisions are referred to as "Provinces" in history. In fact, they are called "states". Just like we are called the United States of America, so also south of the border they call their Republicans, the United States of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some images very 'A' in which his richly toned voice is exploited with good results. Watch and listen to his narration in THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
