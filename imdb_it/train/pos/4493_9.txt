This is an excellent film about a traditional working-class family in the north of England. Shot on location in Bolton, he sees James Mason as the father who is the dominant force in his home. Or so it seems. Intelligently, the film, based on the game, portrays the complexities of family life. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with many familiar faces supporting the loan.
