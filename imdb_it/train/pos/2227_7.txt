This will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't fit comfortably in any mold. It's horror ... but it's not a splatterfest. It's kind of Suspense and Horror, but without the usual Hollywood screams and the jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film is spartan and light with almost no special effect because I think you should listen and look at the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. This is a red herring. He acts here. 'Camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau is giving a solid performance, so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know the excuses apology in which the actors clearly do not care anymore and are just waiting for the director to make the "Cut" shot and get their salaries. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with an almost amusing regularity. I don't think the intent was fun ... but to keep you in balance. <br /> <br /> Consider it less of a horror movie and more of a horror "play" on a stage - that decrepit whitewashed house. So you might see that it's really paranoia, fear and spiral madness set in an isolated place in the US. <br /> <br /> And it's tortuous. Time travel, mind control, secret and Nazi experiments that CANNOT be dead. . .yet. <br /> <br /> I say rent it and try it if you want something a little cerebral. This would be a good choice for a Saturday at midnight.
