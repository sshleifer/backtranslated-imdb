I love this movie. I remember once, when I was in second grade, my teacher showed it to me on a 16mm film. This film, however, can be a little scary for second grade kids, like the scene where Bill kills Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because he studied about it during the music lesson. If I were a teacher and could classify the people who produced this wonderful film, I would give them an A +.
