This film is one that has played very well in 1932 and probably wouldn't have worked well today because its style is a bit old-fashioned and artificial. However, if you are the kind person like me who loves old Hollywood movies, cut the movie a little and you can enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a department for problematic pregnancies. In this large room there are about half a dozen beds where women wait to give birth, but doctors are worried about possible complications (hey - such a room would really traumatize mothers!). And, as in an episode of "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", every mother has her own special story. With so many rather extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend disbelief. I could and enjoyed the movie a little. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the stories: One is about a father. You don't see mom, but she's a very, very nervous father and is included for comic relief. However, it was wonderful here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is sent to the hospital from prison - apparently she killed a horrible boy. You don't know exactly what happened, but you assume that she was trying to force herself! However, she was given a 20-year sentence - and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a horrible person. He has the maternal instinct of a hamster - a really, really bad, alcoholic hamster! It's pretty funny and most of the movie is worth seeing. I loved drinking it from a bottle of hot water full of gin and also angry when she learns that she can't make money by selling her twins !! Towards the end of the film, she has a typical Hollywood-style change of heart that had to be moving - I found it invented. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to an unborn baby. Surprisingly, afterwards, they put the woman back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth !!! A madwoman, whom you lost a child some time ago, moves away from the psychiatric unit. She insists she's having a baby. Later, he runs away again and actually takes one of the children! <br /> <br /> There are many stories, but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. As I said, it's a kind of soap opera and it's very funny - and rather sad in the case of many of the stories. The ending, in particular, is heartbreaking and exceptionally well done. There were some particularly good performances - in particular Farrell and Aline MacMahon as head nurse. All in all, a very beautiful film - and I have no idea why they thought they would have to redo the film a few years later (something typical for Warner Brothers).
