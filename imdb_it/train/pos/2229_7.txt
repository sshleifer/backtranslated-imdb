I read some terrible things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confused, confused, horribly structured." Although there may be merit for some of these charges, this film was not as horrible as your average DVD programmer. In reality, he actually had aspirations. He tried something beyond the typical absurdity of monsters and slasher. And for god, there are some interesting things going on. <br /> <br /> Ms. Barbeau is a miracle to behold. Bring the film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY eventually collapses under the weight of its own ambition. There are too many (unexplained) subplots that try to coexist. And the loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is bad and that in the end she will kill her brother, then why not kill Ma in the first sequence of the film? It seems that he would have left the journey into the future to do so. <br /> <br /> However, I give UNHOLY points to try. A small ambition is not a bad thing.
