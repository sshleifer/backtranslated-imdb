James Joyce's film adaptation of Ulysses is excellent. The actors, the off-screen voice, the director, all capture the sensation of the novel without sacrificing its merits. Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the horned man married to the cheeky Molly. I absolutely love this photo.
