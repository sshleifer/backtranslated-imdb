Despite its low profile release in this country, and its apparent disdain in other countries (the "R" rating in the US may not have helped - honestly, just because HBC uses C-word!), This is actually a fine artifact. Sentimentalism occasionally threatens to suffocate him, but it is overcome by the way the two leads play. <br /> <br /> It is easy to win compliments just because you are playing a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter may not grasp the physical degradation of MND, but its vocal range and its merciless emotional drive fully compensate. In fact, almost all his performance is conducted through his eyes (and what eyes!). This is a clever turn from an actress who is quickly ruining her reputation as an English Rose and who emerges as a figure of stature. The prizes must surely follow, albeit not, alas, for this beautiful performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, you feel, never gave the best on the film (except perhaps "Hamlet", and there his way of playing was diluted by the great cast). Here, however, he overcomes his other appearances, fully interpreting a boy who despises himself, is unstable, ultimately lovable with a subtlety that he has not always shown, and who exhibits both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, just as we could not believe him as Frankenstein, as the priest in "The Proposition", as the lawyer in "The Gingerbread Man", as Andrew in "Peter's Friends". This is definitely his best performance, so why couldn't he produce the goods much sooner? <br /> <br /> As a film, it looks more like a television offering, and without its stars it probably wouldn't be much. But it was a pleasure to see this couple perform with their stockings this way, and I look forward to them more (though not "Love's Labour's Lost" ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
