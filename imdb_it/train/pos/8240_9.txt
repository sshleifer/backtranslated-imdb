I was also available for the first in Toronto. This film was a kind of consolation when I thought I would not be able to enter to see my first choice. Well, I was totally speechless. When I arrived at the theater, I remembered nothing but the basic plot of the film (yes, actually I forgot who was in it.) Shows of the whole cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as a Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly, without lines, like never. Even the kids were great. Surely check this out if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And anyway, I got to see my first choice anyway - and this was much better.
