I haven't seen the movie since the first release, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were excellent, the photography excellent, the plot touching and everything else was of the highest level. Yet it seems to have been practically forgotten <br /> <br /> Perhaps because the UK is a strange market for this, but I have not seen the film on TV or in videos, which is sad. Has it been more successful in the United States, where it could rightly be considered a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always remember that 50% of a good movie is music and even if I'm not sure I think The theme of the title was a simple but moving clarinet solo from "What a friend we have" The film then continued to deny that! Am I right or wrong?
