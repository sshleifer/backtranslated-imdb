The Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spanish film. Everything that happens in this film has a symbolic meaning. It is totally different from the usual movie you have access to. <br /> <br /> This film is good but it will only work for people who want to look for the meaning of everything in the film's history. I must say that this is not a sample film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself !!!
