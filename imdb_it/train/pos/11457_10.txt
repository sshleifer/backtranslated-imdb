As the jacket proclaims, this film is "Beautifully filmed and masterfully modified" and, yes, it is beautifully beautiful. The timelessness we perceive in the stoic rock and in the incessant ebb and flow of water, frames the ephemeral works of Goldsworthy's hands so that in their own effimerazza they point towards eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his compositions pursuing us with a touch of woven melancholy - or in the words of Matthew Arnold of "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! you hear the screeching roar of the pebbles that the waves withdraw, and launch, upon their return, up the high band, begins, and ceases, and then again, with a slow tremulous cadence, and carry the eternal note of sadness. <br /> <br /> At some point, near the end of the film, Goldsworthy states that "words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more". Like words myself, I don't take offense and for a moment I consider it immodest because the combination of form and time and change and consistency and color and composition that Goldsworthy creates laboriously and intuitively, is really something more than words can say . <br /> <br /> In another point he comments "What is here to stay ... and what not". This is his theme. <br /> <br /> I think that artists during the twentieth century have become acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were intentionally ephemeral. The idea was that, underlining how short even the most powerful works of humans are, a sense of the eternity of art would be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this type of expression. He laboriously composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide reaches it, or places it in the river where it will be swept away; and in this process both the composition and its ephemeral merge. <br /> <br /> Both the transient and the timeless are necessary to understand our world and our place within it. And it is important that these works are done in the context of nature, so that what is composed is placed in what is natural. Thus the stone walls and stone eggs that Goldsworthy builds are silent and solid, but we know that they are not monuments for eternity, but instead they will remain for an indefinite period of time and then dissipate and return to a state very similar to what existed before we arrived. <br /> <br /> This is art as art should be, similar to the spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Goldsworthy's work is an inarticulate understanding. It is a purely time and form experience. In a certain sense his work "responds" to the famous poem by Shelley "Ozymandias" saying, even if the tide washes away the work, and even as the river dissipates the expression, even so art lives because of our experience. In the same way one thinks of the Tibetan sand canvases so carefully composed and measured, and therefore just as they are so wonderfully and preciously finished, they are given to the wind, so that we could know that everything is a flow. <br /> <br /> Yet in the modern world these works of art resist photos and videos. Goldsworthy is an established photographer (by necessity I would say) and all his works, even those that are unsuccessful, he tells us, are photographed so that they can look at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has achieved and what he has not . <br /> <br /> This film production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with Fred Frith's beautiful and appropriately haunting music is not to be missed. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
