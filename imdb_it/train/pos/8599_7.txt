It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG character and turns him into a secret service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that made me guess. Equally intriguing was the particular job of showing the safety precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady. All contacts were good enough, but as far as possible, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster just pushed you and you really believe you're the FBI Starling agent in "Silence of the Lambs", you don't have the same feeling with Longoria. However, this is a fun movie, the escape entertainment with the Beltway as a backdrop.
