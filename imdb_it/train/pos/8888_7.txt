This film started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle. However, the fact that the film lasted two nights broke this moment at its peak. The second part was really interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending. Playing football in the yard? Really, could he become more sloppy and mischievous? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I will not make great efforts to tune in to that if it's something like "The 60s".
