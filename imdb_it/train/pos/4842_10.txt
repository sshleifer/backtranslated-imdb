If the thought of Arthur Askey just twists you, don't worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, like the equally wonderful Back Room Boy, is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance, too that of the protagonist. Personally, I love Askey, maybe it's because I go to his world, rather than unreasonably expecting it to come into mine, which is a mistake that too many people make. The train of ghosts is so intensely atmospheric that one cannot conceive of looking at it without being amazed by the dark and deep world in which it transports you, it is engaging in a way in which few economic and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be in the first desperate years 40 and it is a film that I imagine that few people have ever seen once. The cast is, without exception, extraordinarily good, perhaps Linden Travers puts it up a bit often, but against the background of a lonely wartime train station, it could hardly play crazy and not stand out. The sad disappearance of the delightful Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and is now really in the past, but we wait patiently for us to reward the game.
