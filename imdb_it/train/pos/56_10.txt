This is one of the most incredible stories I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this film had been directed by Larry Clark, then the story of a shooting would probably have been shown through the eyes of the murderer and whatever brought that person to go crazy in the first place. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the plot focuses mainly on the consequences of a school shoot-out, and how the victims who survived were carried out. <br /> <br /> I have seen Busy Phillips in other films before, but her performance in this film is by far the best. The only other film I saw with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan", which made me almost not wanting to see this movie, but she performed very well herself. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen that have been able to make me cry. Trust me when I tell you, this doesn't happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful film, and that's all there is ...
