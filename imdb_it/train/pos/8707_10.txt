"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as "the sword bearer". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that emerges from under the skin in his hand. On the first side it may seem another crazy superhero of the film senseless about unreal events and feelings. But it is not Mechenosets. He can barely even be called the anti-hero. I think it's just a person who has lost the meaning of his life and faith in goodness, justice and love. In his life he never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). His every step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everyone for his gift that becomes damnation for him. And suddenly he meets her. He does not need inactive talks and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She doesn't care what she did. The fact that he is next to her is more important than anything else. But he soon discovers his secret: he kills two people (his ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her in front of his eyes. Even afterwards he could not escape his feelings. They try to escape but it is difficult to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. He is in a cage; she's in a psychiatric hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she believes he will save her. He overcomes many obstacles but eventually finds it. They run again but they are not invulnerable. She is injured, needs rest, but the police almost take them. He doesn't know what to do, they drive in a corner, and then his sword starts cutting trees, the helicopter surrounds them, but there's no need, because she's already dead in his arms, and he's the lonely person all over the world again.
