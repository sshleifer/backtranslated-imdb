After some of the negative reviews I heard in this film, I was doubtful to try it, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my portfolio and thought I'd bet on buying a budget as a movie and saw this and I gave it ago and I'm glad I did, I enjoyed it. Directed by the movie star such as Chain Reaction, the Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox) I had to gamble with this even though it was rubbish but it was not at all, I found some rather humorous humor especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the character Doc Ock. The most pleasant part of the film was excellent. Obviously, like many other people who bought this film, I saw Matthew's name, and that made me understand! and his part is not great at all, it's very short at the end of the film, it's not a big part that makes me believe that this is why people hate the movie. I suggest you try it. Some parts are a poor well that needed polishing, acting and a little more action. But it's watchable.
