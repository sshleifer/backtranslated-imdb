This is the first Michael Vartan film I saw - I didn't see Alias ​​- and I was curious to see if the boy could act. He is sure that he is nice in this film. Natasha Henstridge is obviously beautiful but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and lovable in this different "sweet" teacher role. Some of the negative comments I've read are true, the film is full of clichés and the story doesn't seem at all true. Also, even if every character in the film emphasizes how beautiful they are together, I don't think there's screen chemistry there. Anyway, I liked this movie. The settings are beautiful, the characters are nice and good-looking and the secondary actors are pretty good. If you expect to see a great love story, it is not. But if you want to see an innocent and pleasant movie with nice characters it's very nice.
