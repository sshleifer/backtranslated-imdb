This film involves you and keeps you glued to the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of camera angles and creative and interesting perspectives that contribute to increase the grip he will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and pleasantly different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will have you discussing the twists and turns that take place through the conscious and the subconscious. It has a mysterious aspect with its dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became the sleepless. He is a great actor who is not even hard in the eyes! He really poured all his being into this role. From the plot to the way it's filmed makes this indie one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing more from this innovative, creative writer / director / director of photography !!!
