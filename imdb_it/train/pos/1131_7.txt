This is a really fun movie. One of those that you can sit and watch without thinking while the plot becomes more and more distorted; more and more fun. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in his day today), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... They are all known and quality actors who act as if they were soap opera stars / producers. If you've ever seen a soap opera and thought, "How the hell did they get this idea?", YOU'LL LOVE this movie. I've seen it several times; and every time I look at it, the more I appreciate humor, the more I realize how well done it is. Don't expect Oscar quality. This is a fun movie to entertain, not an artistic attempt to find "the inner man of man", etc. Sit back, relax and laugh.
