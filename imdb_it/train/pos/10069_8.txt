This film is worth seeing for visual beauty and moving acting alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and artists (both gathered in a secondary role as a star of the transvestite opera) are both condemned to be relegated to servile roles in China. This makes the unlikely bond between an elderly street artist and an even stronger girl as a triumph over native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this film was the soundtrack's tendency to swell emotion rendered useless by the actors' performance. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory summer action movies.
