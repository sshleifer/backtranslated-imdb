Four stories written by Robert Bloch on various people living in a beautiful and ancient villa and what happens to them. The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the murderer he's writing about come to life. Some spooky moments and the turning point in the end was good. The second is that Peter Cushing becomes obsessed with a wax figure who remembers his late wife. The third has Christopher Lee who has a son (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. This leads to a rather frightening ending (although the ending of the story was MUCH worse). The last is a real comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing the scenery) and a cloak that turns people into vampires! There is also a nice line on Christopher Lee who plays Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good anthology of horror - nothing terrifying, but the first and final of the third gave me some small pleasant thrills. Even the fourth is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire! Even the house itself looks beautiful ... and very disturbing. It is well directed with some nice touches of atmosphere. A very good and unusual soundtrack. All in all, a small anthology of horror is worth looking for. Try to see it on DVD: the Lions Gate looks fantastic with strong colors and an exceptional sound.
