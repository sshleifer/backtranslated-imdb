Three girls (an all-female media crew, including cult actress Barbara Bach, no less) who visit a small town to cover a festival, end up renting rooms in a house that they should have avoided like the plague. Astonishment well done, suffers a bit of redundant dialogues and a rather thin plot (which does not do much good at hiding its secrets). An underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (as in vintage shock material), and this is basically what the film thrives on. Shows and cinematography are practically above average (compared to many other films of the late 70s / early 80s in the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this film is the rather long culminating scene in the basement setting. From the moment the "Keller Junior" character was introduced, his performance left my jaw open and did not end until the end of the film. A very nice surprise to see actor Sydney Lassick (who was strangely wacko in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", and now completely demented in "The Unseen") take on one of the main roles.
