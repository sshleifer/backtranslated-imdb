I really enjoyed the meeting! I would have rated a 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was not even a mention of where I am today or why they did not attend the meeting. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> However, I was glad that TNN managed the series again! I have been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to record the whole series (maybe I lost some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
