The title caught my attention and then I asked myself what will come out in the plot, since we have seen so many "super-people" films in these years ... and in fact, I really enjoyed it, because there were funny scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman has performed as a media in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to look at my toes again on a wide screen (like at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played the idiot everyday boy who meets the great woman very well, I could really get into his situation. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and Matt, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
