Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. A superb ensemble cast, tight editing and wonderful direction. A film of capers that does not get stuck in standard tricks. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said about this film without ruining it. The tag line says it all - 5 guys. 1 safe. No brain. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an extraordinary cast. George Clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
