Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking he'll make a living doing the stallion. He arrives and quickly discovers that it will not be easy - he goes through one degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope he hooks up with Ratso Rizzo crippled and dishonest (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and leave the city and move to Florida. But will they make it? <br /> <br /> Very dark film, disturbing but fascinating. Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of New York and its inhabitants. In this way it is dated - the city may have been so bad in 1969 but has been cleaned up considerably by now. He also uses every photographic trick in the book: the color becomes black and white; dreamlike sequences of dreams; flashes forward; flashbacks (in particular with rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you call it. It keeps you disoriented and out of the center - but I couldn't stop watching. <br /> <br /> There isn't much of a story - it's basically based on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the last type of show proves it). It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold and cruel urban jungle. <br /> <br /> It was originally rated X in 1969 - the only reason was that the MPAA did not think parents would like their children to see this. Nevertheless, it was a great success for high school students (then X meant that no one was under 17). Furthermore, it was the only X-rated film to win an Oscar for best film. Hoffman and Voight were in contention for acting as it was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! In the end it was lowered to an R (without cuts) when it was reprinted in 1980. <br /> <br /> Even the excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" was introduced in this film - and it became a great success. br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I give him a 10. I DO NOT see it on commercial TV - it is cut into ribbons and unintelligible.
