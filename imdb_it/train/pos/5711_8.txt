At Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great film directors and great pioneers, has created a jewel of light comedy that for all its lightness is a revolutionary and technically brilliant film that has clearly influenced subsequent directors such as the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch , and Mamoulian. The plot, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically throughout the city for the missing ticket, is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes set in a dream world of a director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this film is that, although it is set in the center of Paris and does not include anything really impossible, it reaches a fairytale and imaginative and engaging atmosphere. , in which it seems quite natural for people to sing as much as they talk, or for a fight on a stolen jacket to take the form of a football match. Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what could be the most entertaining work ever made on the film (Or that blond intertwined soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ah!") Also the pleasure is the casting: Clair has gathered a group of extraordinary people clearly different characters, each of whom illustrates with a lethal satirical accuracy a bourgeois French "type", so that the film looks like a set of Daumier prints to come to life. <br /> <br /> Hilarity takes some time to get rolling, and I found the characters not as emotionally addictive as they can be even in a light comedy (as they are, for example, in many Lubitsch films. ) For these reasons I abstained from giving the highest score. But these minor quibbles should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? By any means. Highly recommended if you want a classic and influential film job or just a fun comedy.
