I remember when this film was at the top of the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For the life of me, I can't remember what was going on, but one thing I can say: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film didn't convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> In essence, it is the trials and tribulations of a black woman as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and terrifying, but they are all necessary to see how much this woman has endured. Along the way, we see other women who have had to endure their difficulties and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives his absolute best performance in this film. Danny Glover should have been named at least for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this film is that it treats its subjects in a human way, not like some freak shows like the more recent "Amato". I invite anyone of any race to watch this movie. 9/10
