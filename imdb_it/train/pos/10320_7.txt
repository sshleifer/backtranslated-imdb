*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I recently saw this film with my 11-year-old son and I was glad to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. Ron Ely is right as a Doc. Cold, calm, almost always in control (and with an occasional flash in his eyes). What more could you ask for? I've never read a Doc Savage book, so I don't know if it's true to the source, but I liked the light tone and the derring-do. Many people have compared this film to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I don't think is right. The budget difference is staggering (the Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive localization work Raiders has. Even the special effects are minimal, but from the people, the story is very funny and the humor is right. Sousa's music is captivating (I love that theme song. Every time I watch the film, I end up humming the theme for days). The best way to approach this film is simply RELAX and fun. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence in which the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper on the rooftops of New York and the VERY fun combat sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. The villain who sleeps in a giant crib isn't really that good (really!). Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thanks to the gentleman who is here!
