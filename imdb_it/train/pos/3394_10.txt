I watched this movie by accident, after buying it as side B on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later, the rest is just the TV movie stuff. But Soylent Green is in another league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I've never seen before. Heston casually puts himself to bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely foreign! An entire crowd of people is picked up by a fleet of mechanical excavators! A priest who confesses and is struck by the confessor. Ok maybe it has been done since then - but there aren't many films so consistently original as this one. And what on earth is happening between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Fortunately, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I looked at it again and I appreciated all the little clues that make the first ancient scenes worthwhile. A very nice script and also some fantastic sets. Just when you thought you saw it all. . .
