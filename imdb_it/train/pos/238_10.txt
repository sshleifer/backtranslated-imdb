I can imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all do "Chick Flick" on me. I am a Big Strong and Masculine Man, Macho Man, who seems to think that this was one of the best films of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The acting was superb and the story was wonderful. This is a wonderful medicine for the heart and soul. The Acting could not be better nor the cast of the film. <br /> <br /> I have known for quite a while that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is among the greatest actresses who have ever appeared in cinema. And obviously Cloris Leachman (also in this film), in my opinion, could actually overcome them all in the magnificence of his talent and in the various roles that he appeared over the years .. However this was an incredible cast. This film was like a book you can't write, and when you reach the last page you want more ... even more. I cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on IMDb only evaluates a 3.9 <br /> <br /> That assessment here is absolutely incredible for me. Or maybe not. Perhaps I always understand it very well and this is what makes me really sad. It always makes me so sad that films like "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club", skyrocket in popularity when in reality at least in this view the spectators should have received an "R" "vote ... R that's for" Rubbish ". Hey ok, I realize that there are many different stories in this world for a very different audience, but it's a sad comment when this beautiful, powerful movie ... extraordinarily, Directed, Acted and written seems to be over. <br /> <br /> Of course it was also at the Academy Awards .... How sad. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad story, bella? guarda ...... do you prefer to own this movie ...
