Penny Princess finds the American working girl Yolande Donlon the heir of a small kingdom that is located in that triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet called Lampidorra. It seems that the Lampidorrans must pay throughout Europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling because of its geography. An American multimillionaire buys the place, but he dies before he can take the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But of course the estate has to go through homologation in America and what should Lampidorran do? Especially since Donlan, who became a princess, has prohibited smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is traveling in Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that the Lampidorrans have a type of cheese to which they refer jokingly as Schmeeze. With a few bumps on the road, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> As Schmeeze works, this is the trick of the whole film. But here's a suggestion. Jack Lover may have just caught Schmeeze's secret when he was busy inventing VIPs for Rock Hudson and his ad agency. <br /> <br /> However, Penny Princess is a delicious blend of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon, once again, will play a role in the role of Marilyn Monroe in case the film was made on this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde had been chosen in the part that at the beginning of his career was a romantic heartbeat, long before anyone but himself suspected that he had the acting costume designers he had. <br /> <br /> This film was sadly shown at 3:00 am on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
