Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo perform in this fun and entertaining film. The late Fred Gwynne is truly as wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with his grandfather Munster (Al Lewis), his wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has an entire section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and grandfather begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames the two. The two must now delete their names before it's too late. Laugh out loud just like I did.
