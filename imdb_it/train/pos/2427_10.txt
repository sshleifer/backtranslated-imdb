This is really a great unknown film. A perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s. This film was based on the actor's talent and was pulled out. He also had some comedy, but it was not an exaggeration. Once in a lifetime it's what a crime drama should be, not the typical style of sex junk. I especially loved the interracial aspects of all this. <br /> <br /> Now on the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was very good at playing a career as a child criminal. It is a pity that he is allowed to show his talent only in his film. Titus Welliver was fabulous as a Fishburne junky half brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly spicy film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey / drug lord. I loved his acting from "King of New York". But the best acting in this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly matched as two of Calderon's henchmen. <br /> <br /> Once in the Life is definitely a goalkeeper. **** 1/2 * on *****.
