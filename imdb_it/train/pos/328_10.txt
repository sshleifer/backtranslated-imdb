Fascinating I approach I Am Curious (Yellow) and it is a piece to accompany with great trepidation. I had read numerous reports on his controversial controversy and explicit sex. What I got was not this, but a stimulating and engaging cinematic experience that has no equal. I sincerely believe that most of the commentator who felt that the film was "lame" or "boring" approached the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps this is pornography, assuming that pornography is something intended to tickle the senses, but is intentionally non-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, puts it all into her performance giving her a realism and a humanity that is simply convincing and lasting. Her breasts can be yielding, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat and her face plump. But at the end of the film, the public gets to identify with her and accepts her flaws as human. This touch gives you even more credibility by necessity. If the director had thrown a Briget Bardot bomb, the effect would have been canceled. I cannot recommend this inspiring piece more strongly. Be prepared to invest a lot in this deliberately filmed journey. The patient and unpretentious viewer will be completely rewarded in the ways most other films could dream of.
