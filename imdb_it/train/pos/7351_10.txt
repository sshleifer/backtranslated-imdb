This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and the best film of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job of directing this film, makes it fun and adds a family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and offers great performances. Karishma Kapoor is an actress who I hate, this film is a little less annoying, but still annoys in some scenes. Kader Khan is a master of acting and offers exceptional performance. Aroona Irani is exceptional as a mother and offers exceptional performance. Shakti Kapoor is as brilliant as Nandu the adjutant. This film has comedy, action, family drama and romance a full entertainer.
