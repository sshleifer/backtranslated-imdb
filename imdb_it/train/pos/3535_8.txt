** ATTENTION - CONTAINS SPOILER! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I'd like to say that I really liked this game. I took it for Christmas after two months of abandoning the suggestions to my parents. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you're at a party in London, and some villains ruin it by kidnapping the Prime Minister's daughter. Sure, you have to save her, and it's a nice level, but you should probably get at least five minutes. The best part, and I think the fun part too, is when you're in the jet-pack, and people are abseiling on Big Ben. Equip the most reliable jet-pack rocket launcher and detonate the faces of the clock and the enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but rather short. There are four mini-levels you can unlock, and this is one of the disappointed, because only the first two are really fun, and the last two to unlock are just "kill 25 enemies" targets, I mean, there is mon! We have lots of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> Multiplayer, me and some of my friends agree, it's very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. Halo had no bots, but there are still some nice multiplayer games! You can be a bunch of bad guys, and you put yourself against each other, and you can even set traps, which is the best way to kill people without seeing their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd graphic, but not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no need for comments, just great, you can drive in jet packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 (the only levels I return to are the Loondon and Istanbul Part 1 levels). <br /> <br /> I dedicate this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <Br /> It might have some improvement, but it's still good.
