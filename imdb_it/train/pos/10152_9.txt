I couldn't wait to see him since I saw him for the first time in his work. Finally found yesterday 02/13/02 on the Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments on his "sweet funny story of 2 crossings" were dead. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, all the other SROs for making the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie MUST SEE IT. <br /> <br /> The presence of Natasha's screen is so hot and her smile is so electrifying, to say nothing of her beauty, that everything she finds gets into my favorite list. His television and press interviews I've seen are just as refreshing and worthy of searching. <br /> <br /> God Bless her, her family and her future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't seem to be available on DVD or video, but I'd be the first to buy it and I think the others would do it too.
