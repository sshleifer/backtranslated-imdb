This film moves without being sentimental - meaningful without being pretentious. It tells a simple story of a family that risks falling apart when technology intrusions and a growing society make the family business increasingly untenable. <br /> <br /> Acting is wonderful, although none of us in the West are likely to have heard of these actors, we should have been doing it for a long time - they play their characters with honesty and reverence - these are imperfect characters , each with great weaknesses, but with a humanity and a kindness so profound that it is impossible not to engage in history. <br /> <br /> We need more films like this - we need more Western directors to make films like this.
