I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'll spill my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series in the beginning. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis, it seemed, was the fifth most important person in the cast. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of season seven, and the character of Anderson (Colonel O'Neill) moved from camp to office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I don't know if it's because Hammond was more important than what I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series became ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, however, were fantastic. The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out to be, even if it wasn't the original intention, a brilliant installation for the series. I suggest you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you will get a new appreciation for the second time, believe me), and then watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but that does not mean that they are not good. It just means I'm disappointed if you've been ruined by the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After finishing this series, be sure to watch the spin-off series, Stargate: Atlantis. He is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT of 7-18-08: I just heard that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
