This is a great Canadian comic series. The film tells of how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the chief screenwriter of the show and his friends Rickie and Bubbles exaggerate him in what is the true satirical aspect of life in caravan parks and in the inhabitants of said trash hoods . The film will explain to you why Rickie and Julian start making their most advanced forays into the world of crime. BECAUSE and the reasons behind all this would be a spoiler, so I won't give the real reasons behind their brightest escapades. Their friend and often partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and the lack of the film won't affect the way you see the sitcom a bit. It is a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire on camper life and little scammers of the time with small temporal ideas but big dreams over time. If you've ever had the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this program take it. You'll be glad you did. And for my American friends --- it will break you too. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. TV as TV should be.
