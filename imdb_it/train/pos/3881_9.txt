This film caught me with the incredible opening sequence that deceived me into a complete reversal of perspective, so I was fascinated by the moment the title arrived. The theme of this film is that they all act, try to re-invent themselves, but not in a complicated way like Identity or Usual Suspects, but in the way we all try to make any life trivial we find ourselves in a little more interesting. The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular. At one point Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) participates in a seminar laughing, where he is the worst student. His discomfort in this allows us to see the depth of his desire to change himself. The film made me think about the hidden mysteries that hide behind the surface of the most common people I see every day. There isn't much plot here. Guessing the old man's secret is easy enough, but the charm is trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they find out. This film fascinated me in the same way as Sideways, although the characters couldn't be more different.
