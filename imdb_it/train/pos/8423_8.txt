What My Bush is first and foremost a very entertaining Parker and Stone show, I thought. It is often very very funny, and it is rather subversive and crazy. South Park fans would definitely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the value of production here. A lot of money must have been put into this, and show. Lots of expensive little details. It's not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but they put a lot on this show, of course. In a way, I realized that the death of the show was too expensive. Surely it could have been made cheaper and the will went there. <br /> <br /> The critics liked and had their little fans, but failed to get a large audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which I think is almost a season. <br /> <br /> As I loved it the show has its flaws. The problem with the show is that it doesn't know what it really wants to be. It's like trying to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time. Actors do a good job, and some of them are well cast, but in my opinion they don't always get the bizarre humor they should present. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the show needed some characters that were more on the ground for the show to work. In South Park you have Kyle and Stan, who are kind of a realistic touch in the most looney universe. I think this is how South Park works. You need some sensible characters that you can relate to in a realistic way, and this makes things crazy a lot more interesting because it forces you to take them seriously at a certain level. If all that is archetype and stereotype is difficult to emotionally include on the show, which is really the biggest problem of Thats My Bush. Kyle and Stan are South Park characters who make sense of madness on the show. We have nothing of the kind here, and this show suffers. <br /> <br /> Another anchor point is Parker and Stones flirting with Republicans. It's the only thing about them that I don't really get what they're trying to do. Don't portray Bush as anything but a stupid lovable character from Homer Simpson. It's kind of a subversive in a world where many people can't stand it and thinks it's the worst president from Nixon, and a world of Letterman's parallel comedies and so he only satirizes his every move ... but it's hard to tell if Parker and Stone actually mean something from this. It's as if the joke was on us, but somehow it didn't hit the mark. It sounds awkward, because the real Bush does not remind you at all. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I really thought the show was very funny. Some of the jokes here are hilarious. The pro-life advocate who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes in every show. And the show is full of great stuff, and sometimes it's insanely fun if you use your head a little while watching it.
