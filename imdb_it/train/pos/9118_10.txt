I saw this film with a special screening of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It's so interesting where this guy comes from. Now he is probably the world's leading independent African director. And I'm not talking about black directors, I'm talking about directors rooted in culture. The idea if something testifies to the diversity and range of African themes, with his film 500 years later is an African issue. But the idea does not correspond to that mold. Showing artistic diversity. The film is an all-African cast, but the subject is a human topic that many of us could refer to. I love the delicate comedy in it. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is simply fantastic, it really is a gem of art.
