The moment I started watching it I realized I was watching a quality production so it didn't surprise me to find out that the script was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle. Both brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So my only complaint is that Emma hasn't performed 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was superb, I think Prunella is as good as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong so much. Language is a pleasure to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right to go to someone without actually saying a bad word? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith, in fact the cast was very similar to that of Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! So once again thanks BBC for another piece of quality television. I saw the version of Paltrow and that's fine, but I think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD !!!
