I've always said that Batman's animated movies were much better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated films, but outside the group, this is the poorest, and it's rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> "Mask of the Phantasm" would be the best, then "World's Finest", then "Sub Zero", then "Return of the Joker", and finally this last file. <br /> <br /> In this brand new animated film, there's a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman is intent on finding out if she's a friend or an enemy as she launches out for revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce gets involved with three young women, he starts studying them and discovers who the new batgirl is. <br /> <br /> The tone of this film is unusually light considering that most of the films are dark and gloomy, which was rather disappointing. Bruce acts strangely outside the character most of the time, the bad guys are reused from the latest movies, and while the action scenes are exciting, they really aren't anything new. The dramatic impact of the other films is also missing, especially that of "Sub-Zero" which was heavy in the drama and development of the character. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film seems rather recycled and the supporting characters are fascinating but no one is really worth cheering for. <br /> <br /> All the time, I really enjoyed it, I had a lot of fun, and the identity of the new batgirl is amazing, but it wasn't as exciting as I had hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half off ****)
