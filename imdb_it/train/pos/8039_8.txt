Sniper gives new meaning to war movies. I remember the films on Vietnam or the Second World War, a lot of shooting, everyone dies, bam bam. "Cecchino" brings war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly conveys all the emotions it aims for: the helplessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. A seemingly low-cost film compensates for every flaw with action, suspense and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just a blow, a kill.
