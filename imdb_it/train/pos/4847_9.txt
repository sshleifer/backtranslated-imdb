This film is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never REALLY expect that someone else "understands" it but I like it when I recommend it and someone appreciates it. My late father hated Arthur Askey, but this film was one he was really appreciated and his constant enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Olmes "was transferred to me as a child. Years later, the I look at it every now and then, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it won't be exactly the same thing, but I'm never disappointed. There is a lot to enjoy. arrogant. So the whole section in the station is amazing, with so many things to do. Yes, it's dated and full of British during the war in accents and plot (based on Arnold Ridley's original work of Dad's Army fame!) But full of wonderful interpretations of characters - including Kathleen Harrison as a magical spinster. The atmosphere is almost as sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle - this is available as cheap UK chip on DVD so allow yourself n treatment. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any lazy day light piece of light entertainment. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD FILMS!
