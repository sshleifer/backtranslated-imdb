There is an old saying that refers to the new film by Joe Johnston, which gives an example like this: "The man who thinks he can do it and the man who thinks he can't be right are both right". This is a very presumptuous statement that refers to the self-determination and conviction of an individual, which, in this film, is true even after roadblocks and family problems stand in the way. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself by the name of Homer Hickam, who grew up in a strict and traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small mining town where almost every man grows up to be a miner. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer didn't come out for that future. <br /> <br /> One night, as everyone stares at the sky, a Russian spaceship called Sputnik passes over his head. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, tell everyone that you want to work in the area of ​​the rocket scientist for an occupation. Stunned by what he says, his family passes the idea over their heads and continues with life as usual. His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very intelligent individual when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start testing model rockets and blowing up a white fence, then what appears to be a forest fire is frightened of them, they are forced to finish their progress. <br /> <br /> The shows in this film are absolutely compelling from beginning to end. All actors give shows as if this were the real jumbo mumbo here. It stands out in all the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This could be an Academy awarding material if the judges can remember until the beginning of the year in which this film was released. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are extremely well developed. Not only do the filmmakers give a clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the public how they are doing in their missile research. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, in particular the father, who is bent on the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film loses some of its momentum halfway through due to a fool, a romantic and recycled sub-plot that involves Homer's love interest and how his brother has it stolen from him. This type of this is becoming so terribly common in high school films, not that this film is intended for high school students. The actors stare at each other without thinking, as if they were in a trance. I endured it without complaining in 1997 "Inventing the Abbots", but I've had enough. <br /> <br /> But this is only a small complaint. With a period of authentic looking, the cinematography deserves an Oscar and the clips of real life Homer and friends at the end, which struck everyone with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great movie of 1999. < br /> br />
