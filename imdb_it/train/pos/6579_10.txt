Does it seem like the best Quo Vadis screen version? never done. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes snaking and losing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties. But the film is truly and wonderfully "strange", has an enigma and a style, which the other versions - with R. Taylor and the new one from Poland - certainly lack. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of the decline of paganism and infantile Christianity. At least I think it is). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did a great job portraying their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the biggest hit of the cast (not to mention Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's all. That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
