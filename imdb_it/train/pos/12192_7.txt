This 1947 film was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also starred in the beautiful Rita Hayworth with less eye-catching short blond hair. So, I went out with Orson first in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the third man etc. But this was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well, she does a great job playing the scared / cautious Elsa, married to a paralyzed millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall in love. He wants to run away with her, he doesn't know if he can live without the things money can buy. Elsa, her husband and her partner argue and bite, just like the sharks that Mike describes by sticking to each other and his preaching simply turns out to be too true. Several twists follow this mystery of murder as we arrive at the climax in the entertainment house. (Think of the final shooting in The Man with the Golden Gun, which he borrowed a lot from this scene). I wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish is concentrated on the sea, it is thin, harsh and pungent, all with great effect. These may not be the best, fresh shrimp, but Costco's good quality frozen shrimp. The savory sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink prawns as they are filled on a healthy alternative, but with a more mundane filling, common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
