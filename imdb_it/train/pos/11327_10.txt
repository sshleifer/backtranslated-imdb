this film probably has a budget of $ 750 and still manages to overtake Titanic. I rented it the day I crashed my mother's car, and it was the only thing that made me so happy! must be linked to "The Assult of the Killer Bimbos". The things to look for are: 1. The drive in blow job scene of the Chinese girl 2. The blonde bleach in the sassoon shirt that never changes 3. The screech similar to Flinstone guide 4. The resounding set worn by the redhead just before she killed (don't worry, I'm not ruining any surprise, because it's so predictable) 5. The boy who finds it necessary to howl. 6. The mental patient who does a convincing job of being crazy by smashing a person's eyes. 7. The pursuit of an hour at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. the womman who writes graffiti on the bathroom wall. 9. last, but not least, the wonderful special effects - especially the breast stab that made ... a paradise help me ... popping noise. <br /> <br /> have fun! <br /> <br />
