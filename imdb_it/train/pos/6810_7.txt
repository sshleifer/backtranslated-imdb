After reading the book, I came across this DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and thought, of course, what the hell ... I took the DVD and saw it last night. When I started watching it, I checked the execution time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, OK, beautiful ... It seemed to run rather slowly, knowing the story and how much there was. The moment I arrived at the murders, I thought "how much time is left?" Controlled. "A minute?! What the hell ?!" I felt incredibly cheated, thinking that the film had progressed only a third of the overall story. <br /> <br /> But then, I noticed with pleasure that the DVD scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2. I still had another hour and a half to go! I then sat very happily and enjoyed the second part of the film, even more than the first. I admit I didn't see the original 1967 film (despite my most sincere desire to), I still read the novel and feel that this is a fairly downward film, for a two-part television miniseries, that is. I think the choice of Perry's role was completely wrong and some minor inconsistencies blew me away, but they were still very well done. The first half drags on a bit, while the second half is much more compelling. I think they should have proportioned the film more like Capote did in his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 later, and 1/3 after the killers were arrested. Instead, the film makes 1/2 more before the murders, 1/4 later, and 1/4 after the killers have been arrested. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time less engaging as you take the first time to drag back and forth ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize I just did the same error in making things go back and forth, so I'll close the devil. Go watch the movie and make your damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
