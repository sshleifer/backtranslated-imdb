This is a film I decided to see because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I often understand that when a film does not develop around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or a style, it allows the film to be seen as a work of art rather than a demonstration of the actors' ability to differentiate between his styles. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely more about style than about history. While I found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows history and atmosphere from movies like Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was a bit difficult to follow at times, and it didn't seem like everything was come together as it could have. He certainly had a mixture of French animation and Japanese souls who joined. Whether this is a good thing or not depends on the viewer. Visually this film is a pleasure for the eyes, and in this sense a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like animation for adults, or you would like to see a different movie than most movies at the moment. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I liked the movie experience, but I got a little disappointed because it could have been better
