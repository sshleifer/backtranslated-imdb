Yesterday my Spanish and Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is again heading in the direction of political confrontation. This is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish high schools. It's a huge lesson on the hidden crime of fascism. The American pilot involved in the Spanish civil war chooses the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most imaginative scenes that Uribe has ever made. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (could anyone tell me the difference between a war and a civil war?) It is used as a scenario of hope when two children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards who begin their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again. A film like "El viaje de Carol" / "Carol's Journey" tells one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. It is a better history lesson than any book could contain. Great job again from the Iberian Peninsula!
