This film is a true masterpiece, it really is. It is rare to come across such a moving film, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak and a little drama to keep you on tiptoe. <br /> <br /> A true family film, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave domestic animals, who have decided to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they go through and the obstacles that they meet along the road. One of the truly wonderful things about this film is its ability to give animals human personalities - vocal acting is so beautiful. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him while trying to save Sassy in the river was a very emotional moment. Chance - who wouldn't love a dog like Chance? It must be the most fluffy and lovable puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very funny for a cat - he cut me to pieces when he was mocking the keeper; 'Here kitten kitten ... not on your life, chubby.' <br /> <br /> There were also many well done exciting scenes, such as Sassy who climbed over the waterfall (I was really scared for her), Shadow that fell into the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all three pets come home ... including the good old shadow! <br /> <br /> An all-time favorite - all those who do not like this film should not like animals. Rent it or buy it now and it will leave you with happy memories that will last a lifetime.
