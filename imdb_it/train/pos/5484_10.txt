This film is basically a documentary of the series of chronologically ordered events that took place from April 10th 2002 to April 14th 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, in Caracas, Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The pathos of the film is real and one feels the pain, the sadness and the joy of the people who experienced this failed coup by President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> One moves away from watching this movie that Hugo Chavez really is a great historical figure. The character of Hugo Chavez alone led the Venezuelan people to overthrow the old 3-day military junta and restore the democratically installed government of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> It is obvious from the movie that George W Bush helped and favored the Venezuelan coup. That the traditional media have helped George W Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is the limited number of people who have seen this film and how few people realize the total corruption of the American media. <br /> <br /> It took only 20 years for Ronald Reagan's elimination of the Doctrine Fairness in 1986 to turn America into a blind and rudderless state. <br /> <br /> May Hugo Chavez opens the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of true American vision.
