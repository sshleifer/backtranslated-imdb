Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of 3 floors, but hey, then?! I thought it was nice enough to be honest. Actually I liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad. <br /> <br /> I also liked Cinderella's voice in this. I have nothing against his voice in the original, but I think it sounds better here, more beautiful. Even in this I liked his personality, he had more than one spine, yet he was still kind. <br /> <br /> So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True at 7/10.
