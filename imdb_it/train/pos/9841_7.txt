I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with "real" actors and sets can't - even if the effects of computers are changing more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), show ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples in "Ice Age", such as when we see a diverse group of extinct mammals migrating through the countryside, chatting like old friends. These scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we have the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Although the ice age is not as good as the best animated films of all time, it's a really fun movie. Sit down, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, lovely backgrounds and belly laughs. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred, the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, taking a human child back to his tribe - for very different reasons. Along the way, of course, they have a lot of problems. Also on this journey there is Scrat, the most unfortunate rodent in history, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on dead trees, in ice caves. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a central part that's just a series of fun episodes with some moments of character building, but some scenes, like diapers or dodos, are hilarious, the animals are nice and looks nice. There is also a very touching moment, when the mammoth cave paintings come to life before Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> It's not a must see, but it's good for an hour of fun or so. <br /> 7/10
