CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Part of the cartoons of New York's political life and a part of moralizing story. Al Pacino, a Dukakis boss with presidential dreams, often offers dark or subdued performances. There are a couple of times that he chews the landscape, and in the case of CITY HALL, that's where it shines. John Cusack gives a soft and unexceptionable performance, without going into the caricature of a dialect of New Orleans, or slipping into melodrama during the climax of the film. Even Danny Aiello, as Burrough's political leader, is very good. I also love showt. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL, and it's a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of lack of momentum. It's more like a documentary than a film. We see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective and, of course, the viewer is not involved. When the spectator doesn't get involved up to a certain point, he becomes apathetic towards the characters and, finally, in the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to alienate, and what should have been a compelling, revealing final came out as an "Hmm ... uh ... okay." They say "You can't fight the town hall", as the tread-worn clich√© says. However, it can't stop you from thinking about what could have been, if they had simply reinforced the script and the rhythm of this movie.
