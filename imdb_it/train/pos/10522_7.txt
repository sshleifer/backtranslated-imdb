This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border with the gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this aspect a boring TV soap in costume, since the whole story is driven by dialogue. <br /> <br /> The acting is competent. Mrs Paltrow is detached, as her character requires, but the distance required by the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she doesn't seem to care enough about the results of her matching efforts. Some of the supporting casts are guilty of over-acting - much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in the movies. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - not his fault, except for having left such an impression as a gay cart in "The High Life" that it is now difficult to accept it by playing a serious part. The acting honors go to Toni Collette who manages to radiate heat and Jeremy Northam who launches his character to the right level.
