To all the reviewers on this page, I should say that this film deserves to be seen. So it was done in 1972, so what? The fashion of the film was exactly the same fashion as his time. People who don't study the culture of the decades would think that this film is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left Behind," (which is made for our time right now), it looks like cheezy. However, the only brazen part of the film is fashion, which has been over 30 years back in the past. BUT. The message sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved. There is so much to say, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of ruining it) Then go out and watch this movie! If you don't like the message it sends, then you have problems, which require some attention!
