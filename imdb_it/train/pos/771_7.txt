I saw the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her friend. So I had opinions from all kinds of directions. Above all, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension wasn't really there and the only appreciable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think he played his role well, even though the script wasn't appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. I congratulate Puya who is entering the world of cinema. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor. <br /> <br /> The wife loved the movie though, and I think there might have been chords played and to which I had no ear. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in today's Romania, it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the story itself becomes just a boring and uninteresting storyline. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why he got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, he should have received the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
