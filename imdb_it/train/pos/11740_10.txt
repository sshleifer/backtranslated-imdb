I do not doubt that the critics have broken this film, especially the artistic fartsys that need a laxative. This is a great vehicle film in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or, more recently, of Don Knotts. It won't shake the world or change movies forever. What he will do is entertain. When all is said and done, it is still the most important thing. Watch this movie and forget your problems. It also has a simple and kind moral message at no additional cost. I've always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. He didn't really steal his schecco from Vampira any more than Vampira did from the original, Theda Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to whoever does it best; And Cassandra Peterson does it better. Long live Elvira; we need more than this kind of film. There are never enough. Even the villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was excellent. Exudes a wonderful and refined malice. I found no technical defects. The execution is as faithful as possible to the art form. My deep compliments to the director, James Signorelli, and all his crew.
