I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4: 00 in my local store and thought it was good enough for a low budget movie, so I bought it and I was right it was good. For beginners this movie is about a killer snowman, so it's something to laugh about and its look is fun compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The acting went well and the jokes of Jack Frost made me laugh "I only cut you for a smoke" and "The most beautiful worlds of the snow cone" what fun and camp is it? The story at the beginning was rather funny and silly "Jack is agile, Jack is fast, Jack has his eyes peeled with candle sticks". If you're looking for a horror B-Movie Comedy full of word games, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
