This film must be put on DVD. It was so fun and I loved it. Really, really cute and fun. Not realistic, but don't suppose we are. The only thing I didn't like was that the girl relied too much on the boy. However, it represents the way of thinking of the period of time. I have been trying to get this film for so long and it has not been available for US format only in the UK and will not be played on US DVD players. Sadly it's a classic movie overwhelmed! Believe it or not, but this movie could easily become a favorite cult, for all ages. Too bad, we don't legalize certain things that could really save small countries or ours. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character who makes lemonade from lemons. She is fun and fascinating. He stole the show!
