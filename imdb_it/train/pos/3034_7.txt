An undervalued addition to Graham Greene's film canon: his perceived flaws can now be seen as virtues. The director Shumlin, theater director, frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the apparently inept compositions suggest irresistibly anxiety. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 1940s thriller!), The film has an honest hero who becomes mad and murderous (and perhaps paedophiliac), brilliantly carries the distant ideologies of civil war Spanish in the shocking dangerous reality, has a horrible murder, a surprising intuition of class and capitalism, intelligent theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of the God of Greene and an end that is happy only if you know nothing of history.
