When I first went to see The Shining I was expecting a decent movie from what I had heard and I liked a lot of other Stanley Kubrick works but when I started watching it it was much better than I thought. Sometimes I felt incredibly uncomfortable and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining because they don't completely follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion both Kubrick's version and the miniseries and the book are fantastic. Jack Nicholson offers exceptional performance. I'm looking for a good original film that will make you think even after the movies, then watch The Shining.
