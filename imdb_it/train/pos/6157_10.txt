This is a film I never thought I'd see until my 3-year-old spotted him at the video store and grabbed him after he liked the animal cover photo on Nabooboo Island. We've taken it and we've seen it repeatedly since then; in fact we have rented it several times since then. There are very few non-animated films that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The acting is great, the songs are exciting, they go deep into your head and you can't help but sing. The plot, while in particular on the Second World War is timeless in its own way and there is something new to see every time you look. I heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that kids will want to see over and over again and parents won't mind sticking to. There are days when we look at him before going to sleep and going to bed and I don't feel that that moan comes when he wants to repeat any other movie.
