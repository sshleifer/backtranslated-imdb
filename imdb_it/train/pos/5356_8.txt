Running Man is not a great film, rather it is rather silly. But it offers what you want in an Arnie movie and that's action and entertainment. I don't see how anyone can enjoy this image, it's so stupid and exaggerated, that it almost makes fun of itself. By the way, this is probably one of Arnie's most popular films.
