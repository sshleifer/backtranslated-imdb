Imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a man spends 8 years of his life, and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case practically alone! The murder technique is clear, but a government reluctant to admit the truth lets a monster destroy dozens of lives. When I think my job is stressful, I simply remember the true story of this film of wonder. The protagonist's devotion to duty was masterfully interpreted by Rea. The comic (and sometimes tragic) relationship between Rea and the character of Sutherland has made this one of my favorite films of the last 5 years. The capture of one of the worst mass murderers in history made me end up in my place. Although not as advertised and talked about "Silence of the Lamb's", the plot was equally suspicious.
