Astounding. Absolutely amazing. This is a film about two children that the father suddenly has a vision. He says that an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill "demons". He gets instructions later, and they begin to gather the demons, who are, with the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head and tear them to pieces, burying them in the rose garden. Their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. The film continues, with a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> The thing I love about this film is that it perfectly captures the fragility of human perception. Is their father completely crazy? Or is he telling the truth? The public is left to decide. Go judge yourself, and watch the movie. Now.
