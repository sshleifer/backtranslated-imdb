I always wondered what happened with that kind of magical feeling that the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... Well, over time I wondered if that feeling was just nostalgia. Or did that "feeling" decide to pack up and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our film story, and then never came back? Or did it? Because for me it was the first time I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it was the old self again. <br /> <br /> There are three qualities of this film that make it as unique and fun as it is to look at: the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of the colors and, what I appreciated most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something that many other (not only) Slovenian scriptwriters should at least consider). There is no use for words when you can understand each other as well (yes, or better) with other means in use. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, with just so many words, that is why I would recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to all of you, as a Slovenian film not to be missed, regardless of what can be heard of Slovenian films if you've ever heard something, that is ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and that scene, where Bakovic is dancing Vivaldi's music ... A treat. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a gift.
