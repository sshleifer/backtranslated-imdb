"Thieves and liars" presents a very naturalistic representation of the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and force them to make difficult, if not impossible, choices about their lives and their loved ones. The cast is excellent, considering that some are non-professional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the film. Photography pushes history without intrusion, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the "Boricuas" in a very profound way. Sometimes it feels like watching a documentary! Watching this movie you feel like you have secretly entered the real Puerto Rican society and remained invisible watching it implode. I loved it!
