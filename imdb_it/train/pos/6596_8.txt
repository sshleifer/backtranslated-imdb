Brazilian films often receive more positive ratings than they really deserve. Rather incredibly, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title, which the producers rejected: God Against Everybody) got a very low GPA (average of the votes) on this site. It seems to be decidedly rejected by female viewers in general. Actually, it's not so brutal. I mean with regard to graphic violence. Its brutality is intrinsic in that it portrays the aspiring lumpens, I mean the losing citizens who actually own high-tech equipment, which coldly executes murder orders in exchange for "grana graúda". Is this postmodern man? Is his only concern a rapid, almost impersonal, ultra-lax lay, amid full meals? The image is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004, so far. His brilliant editing style, à la Godard, his curious soundtrack counterpoints, his general cast more than efficient and, above all, his original narrative, with subtle non-chronological hidden points that come to light only in the epilogue, deserve at least an 8 brand.
