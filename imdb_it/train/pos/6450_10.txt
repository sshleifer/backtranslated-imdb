This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes me on a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and cry and feel disgusted, happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are all brilliant! I must mention the main actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. Does an extraordinary job !! I also admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this young man with mental problems so convincingly! It reminded me of Leonardo's scroll of Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there's the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone to see and have fun!
