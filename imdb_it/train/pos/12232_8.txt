As a collector of movie memorabilia, I had to buy the movie poster for this film which, now that I've finally seen it, must be the best thing. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. However, in your VCR there is nothing more horrible than an hour and a half image of the melting man. At first I thought this film was pure junk but then I realized that it had some qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson must be the most lenient character ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so trivial that it's incredible! ("It's unbelievable! It looks like it's getting stronger as it melts!) <br /> <br /> And could anyone please tell me how the hell they know exactly how long Steve has been before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to "help" him? If this film was meant to scare his audience, I think he missed his vocation.
