Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to have flaws - Rear Window looks a bit like a stage sometimes, Chris Elliot's character on Groundhog Day doesn't work, the Best Years of Our Lives soundtrack is too poor, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow, but this film is perfectly executed from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, the acting is superb (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are fantastic, the whole cast shines), the direction and photography are inspired, and the soundtrack is moving without be intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is truly moving, every moment of light makes me smile. This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen and I wish there were more movies like this. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon became a celebrity after this movie, but I'm sorry to see that his recent films are much more evasive and foolish than this serious film about real people, real feelings and problems real. Brilliant! A must see.
