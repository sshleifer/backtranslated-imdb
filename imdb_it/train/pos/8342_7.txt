Pretty good romantic comedy in which I don't think I've ever seen Meg look prettier. All the players have done a good job of maintaining this lively pace. Of course, in the real world no brilliant mathematician could even take a look at a fat monkey, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... you can simply forget about reality and have fun. Nice film. Damn, Meg is a child, eh?
