I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever stopped doing it, but seeing him again will remind you that all the hustle and bustle of Mrs. Paltrow was in the first place! I had long since abandoned the woman and I still feel rather boring in her Oscar-winning performance "Shakespeare In Love", but she has all the beats here - she is almost as perfect as Emma Woodhouse. He could have won his Oscar for Shakespeare but should be remembered for it. <br /> <br /> Obviously, she is surrounded by a supportive cast including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and others ... Jeremy Northam is as enticing as the love interest, even if the script is bent a little in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all the tension to be emptied of their relationship); many years later, Ewan's hair is a little easier to pick up than it was in '96 and, personally, I find Puckish Alan Cumming a grated presence in anything nowadays. But the main character is, without doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene in which Emma is reconciled with Miss Bates, since she is the character we are drawn to. The film deserves to be watched (once again) only for its interpretation. <br /> <br /> All in all, it has aged wonderfully with charm to sell and more than enough subtlety to solve the British class system. It is worth a rent (because it is unlikely that Paltrow will ever be so good again - but we will always have Emma).
