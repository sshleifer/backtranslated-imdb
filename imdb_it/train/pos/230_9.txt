When I first saw this cable movie, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints an accurate picture of the South and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses prisoners for work. Soll is what makes the move, his amusing ramblings give us an idea of ​​how the South was then. I suppose if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. However, his attitude towards a child who comes to work for him and the prisoners is complex. While he has racist views, he has grown to trust some of the inmates who are all black. The two prisoners he trusts most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the film, they have a real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler, both with great performances and Hass. <br /> <br /> This film should have been more famous. However it is on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
