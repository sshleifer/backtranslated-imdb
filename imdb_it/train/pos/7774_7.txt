"Written on the Wind" was a hugely successful Universal film. It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a great oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a slight touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk laid the groundwork for what would later follow in the soap opera genre, mainly "Dallas" and "Dynasty", to name just two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this film was shot entirely in a studio. Most of the furniture is fake. Like many of those photos from the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in a study batch. Just look at the scenes that should take place in Manhattan, or Miami, or even the lake, you can see how the landscape is a painted background. Mr. Sirk couldn't care less about realism, as long as he could tell the story in his own way. <br /> <br /> We recently took a screening, part of a shot of Mr. Sirk's work, in which people laughed at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes in which Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later his daughter, the evil Marylee, caress the drilling tower that adorns the old man's desk, a sort of object phallic art. <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to yield the best performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a certain extent, Robert Stack, who takes over as Kyle, tormented heir of history. It would probably be the easy explanation of what appears on the screen. The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who has not been asked to make her Lucy Moore character look anything other than a downed person mocked with the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> Along with the other Hollywood movie, "Written on the Wind" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the audience what they wanted to see: larger stories of life that could only be seen on the big screen
