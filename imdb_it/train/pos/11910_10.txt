A delightful little thriller opens with Trevor Howard in his Jag convertible and ends on a dock in Liverpool. It's all excitement and scattering as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as he is getting some R & R series cataloging butterflies (how is it English?). <br /> <br /> Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons joke from London to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in Liverpool (via Ullswater) - he was just kicked out of MI5 or something, and she, you guessed it, is on the run , unjustly accused of murder. There are rude docks, rolling hills in the Lake District, sheep, country pubs, lost copper coins, waterfalls, a group of amateur cyclists, rooftop chases and lots of chinamen (don't ask), and it's all very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque ... <br /> <br /> ..and an incredible example of British Noir ...
