"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli." such was Ned's courage. <br /> <br /> In Australia and particularly in Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and recognized immediately. A Greta is still a hero, the Blood life of the city of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they have not yet forgotten that the three policemen who "murdered" were from there. <br /> <br /> Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the old Melbourne prison, where he had been hanged, he showed up at the post office in Jerilderie. A cell that once housed Greta is exposed to Benella and the site of Ann Jones' Hotel, the station and even the records where it was captured at Glenrowan can be visited. <br /> <br /> Evidence of all the events in the film (except for his love interest) can be found all over Victoria, in police records and even in the Sash that Ned was awarded for saving Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what is left out would further justify Neds' actions. The horse that Ned "stole" was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man with whom Ned enters jail after being released from prison). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen, so he couldn't have stolen it. <br /> <br /> The letter of Jerilderie is more than what was stated before. It is not self-justification, it is the biography of Ned, a description of what he represented and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then decide what was Ned for.
