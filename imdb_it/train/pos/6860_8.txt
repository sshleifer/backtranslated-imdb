The transsexual psychotic Bobbi kills the patient (Angie Dickinson) of a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then chases the expensive prostitute (Nancy Allen) who saw Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is suspected of the crime and is paired with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to capture the murderer. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in two words: it is very sexy (Dickinson and Allen looks good), it is very bloody - with the kind of blood usually reserved for splatter films, and the boy is well done . The screenplay by screenwriter / director De Palma is OK, but it really is a step back from the man's film production capabilities. He has great success on a visceral level and actually I get involved / interested in these characters. I can see the standard De Palma tributes to / ripoff by Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master's images. <br /> <br /> And to complete it all, it has a professional and credible cast. <br /> <br /> This was De Palma's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies".) <br /> <br /> By the way, the actress dancer Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants. There's a little trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't think that a thriller could be elegant and bloody at the same time, but this image pushes it. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is a typical musical score by Pino Donaggio. <br /> <br /> 8/10
