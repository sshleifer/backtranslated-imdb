First love is a desperately difficult subject to convince convincingly at the cinema: the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and offers a moving, sexy, compelling tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching some of the deepest themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The main plot is Mathieu, 18, a loner, an introverted boy who meets Cédric, a brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on vacation with his family. As summer heats up, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, they decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in a catastrophe: Cédric betrays Mathieu who, upset, tries to take his own life. He survives and, to have a perspective on his life, returns to the seaside town where they met for the first time, this time cloaked in the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> If the story were told this way it would never have the impact it makes: much is implicit, everything happens in a non-sequential way. <br /> <br /> The intricate narrative is essential to obtain a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and time perspective. Fortunately, the three timelines (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are color-coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly cold blue for the scenes of the hospital and the heating of browns and blues for the winter sea. <br /> <br /> Both leading actors have nonetheless exhibited excellent performances, while it is a pleasure to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used to all his ability (I'm more used to seeing him under -stretched in Gael Morel's rather limping dramas) , Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) must be mentioned for special mention: one can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character collapse behind a wall of aphasia. The splendidly elaborate gestures go far beyond the possible dialogue. <br /> <br /> The themes touched on are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in truly understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the quicksand of meaning ?? The title of the film "Presque rien" (Almost nothing) indicates all these and, indeed, one of the key scenes of the film: in an attempt to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he has ever deceived about him ?? "Not ?? enfin, oui ?? une fois, corn ce n'était rien" (No ?? huh, yes ?? once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu ?? did you take him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and try desperately to contact him again once he leaves? but he cannot understand that he lost it forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is all for Mathieu. <br /> <br /> While the film is more obscure than Pierre and Gilles' unfortunate poster would suggest is not hopeless: we see Cédric's slow and painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat that adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre, which could be his next love. But the story ends here: an adolescent passion, within a year, another perhaps begins. So what was it? Almost nothing? Certainly not when you're experiencing it ??
