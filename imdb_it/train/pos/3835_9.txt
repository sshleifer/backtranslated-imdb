This movie is fantastic - it's just like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark decorations, the swarms of insects everywhere, the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. It looks a bit like David Lynch's films: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. It is rather a succession of surrealistic events, nightmares and encounters. This is an inconvenience. If the movie had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a catchy ending, I would give a 10 out of 10. But this is missing, which is why I gave the film an 8. Nuit Noire is a movie worth watching. Look for that DVD and you will be rewarded!
