For films like "Anchors Aweigh", few were awarded the highest Academy Award awards in a happy hour warm up. Either 1945 was a besieged year for a good movie or they were still undergoing a sudden shock from Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" who wrote anything starting with A on the ballot for the best photo to please the loyal audience. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in "Singin 'in the Rain", then there had to be something wrong with MGM's behind-the-scenes rigging systems. Obviously, the studio has its best behavior during this highly regarded tour of the big studios and of Hollywood itself, useful for those stuck on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Yet a musical sailor dress with the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra are certainly a fun farce, despite the need for more people to yawn for the musical previews, so today's audiences don't would be slapped with an unnecessary runtime. There were many more pieces before and after, but in this case all of Kathryn Grayson's fascinating scenes may have been eliminated. Until the vision of "Kiss Me Kate" it may have been necessary for non-opera fans to watch his films with the remote control in hand. <br /> <br /> If there was a need to practice picking up women for "On the Town" in 1949, then perhaps the coast would leave the lucky sailors not have to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and attack the piano for a 'hears' Susie' from the whole heart. Few are fortunate to have a screen test at the MGM gold studios. So few are even more fortunate to attend. There are no regrets for the successful tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but it makes the continuous non-operative enthusiast hope that the eventual pink slip can be delivered to both. <br /> <br /> But for everyone, the talents of the stars have a good shape and an above-average score with a light, but amusing, great history of the navy intertwined with ambitious young navy boys, good for the latest bursts moral of the war, makes `Almors, at least, does not question the choice of the wrong MGM film. The director holds while the cast takes the story in a beautiful color cinematography. Whenever someone explodes in music or song, the film represents a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the adventures of Gene Kelly in a fantasy world, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse. This is a well-deserved masterpiece of Kelly's career, and it's nice to know he thought of it before Fred Astaire started dancing on walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It is not exactly a triple flavor, sprinkled rainbow, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a solid square piece of sugar that somehow eventually melts in the mouth and despite guilt is still a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 7/10
