This was one of the highlights of the ST: the semi-forgettable second season of TNG, before they were "grown" or raised in their third season and beyond. This was not only a showcase for animators like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but it was also the continuation of Data's research for his "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> On the sidelines, I am still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with the Okona character who was about to try (after the character of Teri Hatcher) before being abruptly interrupted by Lt Worf . I remember seeing this "first-run" episode in my friends comic book shop throughout the day and we all thought it would be a perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful lady really is ...
