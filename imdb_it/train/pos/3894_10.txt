I wish I could laugh again as much as when I saw this show for the first time. I've never done that since. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I find myself laughing almost harder after watching the show again, and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, it is moving, he is a man of the world. He is skilled in talking about politics and yet does not feel the need to "engage" in political discussion. He is above that. I'd compare it to George Carlin, who uses his play to try to convince people of his ideas, and doesn't seem to like the fact that he's trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> Funny boy on Earth
