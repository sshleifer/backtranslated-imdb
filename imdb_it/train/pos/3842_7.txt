A sometimes surreal thriller that will push the buttons of most people. The fourth man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for politically correct. The protagonist of the story is a bisexual Catholic alcoholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously distorted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. She is impassive, delirious, unable to control her impulses, fear of engaging in meaningful relationships and completely apathetic towards life in general. As the character himself states at some point, he is a professional liar, unable to remember the truth. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Gerard dreaming about spiders consuming Christ, and then he wakes up to start the long march towards his own destruction. He chases a man (presumably a boy), then chases another into a train station. Later, at a conference, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or maybe he has some nefarious plans. Quickly capture Gerard in his network, attracting him with sex and money, having a lot of both. He also has secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she alone and genuinely seeks someone to raise - or is she a deadly black widow, luring Gerard to his death <br />? Will Garard be the 4th man who kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does his best to make you guess what he's up to. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film, with lots of sex and intrigue. It is similar to <em> Basic instinct </em> by Verhoeven, but has much more depth and is certainly more shocking. There is a lot of very strong gay content, which can make some viewers waver. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent psychological thrillers, or anyone looking for something completely new.
