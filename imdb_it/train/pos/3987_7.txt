The Mother is one of those movies that you know to be good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math homework is for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to be invested in. <br /> <br /> History is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character within the first half hour, the romance of December-May, the idea of ​​a man who betrays his wife and then he betrays his lover with his mother, the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-year-olds, the apparent indifference of adults towards children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but it is a return to a collection of British films (usually made for TV) since the late 1980s - it has a moral severity that never subsides, which produces a throbbing enveloping anguish. . <br /> <br /> The mother is impeccable, but this is partly the problem; if a film that deals with so many delicate problems has some flaws - inconsistencies in the script, some minor actors - takes the edge, but if a movie is so perfect, the experience of watching it is raw and painful. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - make viewers ache; London in this film is bright and open, full of hard and sharp light. <br /> <br /> If you're as tough as nails, or you're one of those super-sensitive people who like to torture themselves with twisting their belly films or sad novels, then you'll like The Mother. Whoever is in the middle, give him a lack or be ready to squirm. And be warned: as far as the film is from beginning to end, the worst must come. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to wear make-up for this (for sleeping with her boyfriend), and the daughter calmly says that she thought about it and would like to hit her . The mother agrees, both get up, and - instead of a slap well done - the daughter clenches her fist and makes a boxing blow. Argh !!!
