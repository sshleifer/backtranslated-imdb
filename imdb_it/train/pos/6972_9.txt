The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. In fact, this episode is exactly the same content as the pilot version of the DVD. That said, episode 01 provides a very substantial background to the hugely popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). Significantly applies the majority to the 2007 series. As has happened in recent years science fiction plots, this series explores life or the "virtual" environment. Furthermore, we are given a lot of space on the Adama family line and on their relationship with the unrevealed creator (in the Battlestar Galactica series) of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular theme of "virtual" life and (as expected) at the beginning of colonial life and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed this episode. Although it was not a new material for me or anyone who has seen the Caprica pilot's release on DVD, the series looks very promising. As in the case of many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger in order to guarantee an audience following (science fiction community). I will certainly continue to look for resolution and development. <br /> <br /> I gave this series 8 stars.
