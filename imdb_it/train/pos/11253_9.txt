This is a very long film, which means that you could get very bored before it gets interesting, but its duration gives its characters the opportunity to find a permanent attachment in your likes. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by the guilt of the hateful you will find it particularly heartbreaking, because it is a story that finds its heroes between evil and weak. If you can love a monster, you cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - especially his country, his friends and his family - a man who has been manipulated and molded since childhood by those same people. <br /> <br /> There is not a really nice character in the whole story, not a loyal, "moral" personality to sympathize with. But to observe everything without the help of a handkerchief would be truly remarkable. In the end I loved it. It is worth it for the people who like the inspiring films on the basic human character.
