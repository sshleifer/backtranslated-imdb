This is the film for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment activity. Lars von Trier creates an extremely charming, noir atmosphere of post-war Germany. Get absorbed in the dream and let yourself go only to the end credits. The plot is necessarily second, but it is still an electrifying story with problems that are difficult to raise. Just wonderful.
