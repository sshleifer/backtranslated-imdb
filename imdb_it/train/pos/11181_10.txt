This is one of the scariest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movies EVER! <br /> <br /> Dr Creed (Louise) and his family move into a new home with his wife (Rachel), Daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). Everything seems normal until Dr. Creed does not lose one of his patients that a terrible head injury, then he is haunted by the ghost to know that Victor takes him to the Pet Sematarty and shows him the one where the dead come to life. <br /> <br /> Louis not knowing if it was all a dream and talking to Ellie who worries about her cat that could be killed by a truck and then later Rachel tells Louis that it's really hard to talk about death because of her sister Zelda who was really sick (As we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most disturbing scenes ever!) The next day Louis receives a call from Jed who says the cat is was killed by a truck and Jed took him to where Victor the Ghost was not going to go! And burying the cat, his wife and children went to see their grandparents and Louise is home alone shocked to see the cat come back and is now evil in the eye so she goes to see Jed then Jed tells him that he also buried the his dog there too (as we have seen other flashbacks). <br /> <br /> Later in the film Family with Picnic, Gage is playing with the kite and Gage says I drop it ", The wind blows the rod near the road where a truck arrives at the fast past , Gage is approaching the road, Louis is rushing to catch him, The most HEARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will start with the Jaw on the floor or Shivers will come down your back when you hear Louis scream, Soon misses so much, Louis then buries Gage in the same place where the Cat is buried. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from real life. <br /> <br /> This film is simply fantastic and everyone's acting was fantastic! 10 out of 10
