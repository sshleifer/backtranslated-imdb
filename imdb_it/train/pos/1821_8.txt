When I was a child (and my father owned a video store), this was one of my favorite movies. Since then I had never heard of it, nor did I really remember anything, having been forgotten in the wake of other films, probably better than Don Bluth. I was able to trace it a few weeks ago, however, and I was pleasantly surprised again. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the entertainment is delicious and the songs are memorable. There are some problems in continuity if you look pretty good, but generally they don't detract from the plot, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even a bit of a bad mood if you're an animal lover). The characters are credible (maybe even a little too big for younger observers). Two legs raised, and for those of you who haven't seen him for a while, it's definitely worth seeing him again.
