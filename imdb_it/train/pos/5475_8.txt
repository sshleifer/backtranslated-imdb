Finally, the full version of "Baby Face" surfaces and from which source? The Library of Congress. The four minutes restored, fragments here and there, represent a much better film. We now know that Baby Face has been exploited by her old man since he was at least fourteen. Another reason for his behavior and cold, external calculation. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is truly incredible in the role of Lily Powers (note the moniker), a part that required only the right dose of sexuality clad in power, cunning and revenge, still tinged with virginal fiction when requested , a very difficult portrait to convince. Barbara Stanwyck transmits the nuances necessary to show that although she sleeps to the top (literally), she still has good in her heart - she notices the way she treats the few who were kind to her like Chico (the wonderful actress Theresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And even if he uses his sexuality to create mash of rich and powerful men, those same men are trying to exploit it for their carnal desires without intention of permanent bonds until they fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers fails to understand, at the beginning, that emotions are difficult to drive, that it is easy to lose control. One possible result is death. Approaching a cart to a star, of course, materialism can take it to a destination where there is nothing but the ephemeral, and it is a cold solitude. <br /> <br /> A word should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche of which The Will of Power is emphasized in "Baby Face" by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when he is still turning tricks for his old man. "Baby Face" was published the same year that Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is highly unlikely that the semi-literate Hitler would understand much of Nietzsche, he considered himself a Nietzschean to the nth degree and propagated him alongside his other speeches. "Baby Face" serves as a charge for the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's desire to reinforce the concept, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the prettiest little baby face". it is themed as "Baby Face", an even more eloquent and applicable melody is "St. Louis Blues" by WC Handy reproduced throughout the film, especially at times when the camera has to move away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes. "St. Louis Blues" is also used wisely towards the end as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico is singing a rough and salacious version of "St. Louis Blues" when Lily, now in disagreement with the lyrics, orders her to stop. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude towards sex as power than many new versions of Hollywood. By all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy.
