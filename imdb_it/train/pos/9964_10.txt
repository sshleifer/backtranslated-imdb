Take it. The DVD is cheap and easy to find, the length is now standard and you have spent enough time without it. (When the home video started, there were at least 3 versions with missing parts ...) Everything you read is true. There is no defending it, and not living without it. The color is lush and wonderful to look at, and production values ​​are pretty good for an epic Saturday afternoon kiddie. But no question ... the whole of Santa Vs. Satan's corner is so amazing that it made the movie a success at the time and a cult fan once home video started. How good / bad / strange / true is it? I saw the TRAILER as a child and I remembered it for almost 30 years ... including Murray's voice above the highest voice ... I told my older sister and she called me a liar and I couldn't believe that it was POSSIBLE for ANYONE to make a film in which Santa vsSatan .. Add to it stuff similar to Santa asking for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before leaving on Christmas Eve, the children who want to capture it and make them their SLAVE..and a kiddie kiddie international shop ... and probably comes close to a lot of nightmares that children have had in the 60s. Like the others here, I look at it in every holiday season. (My favorite version is The Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But whatever your old way of choosing, the film is a demented masterpiece and an absolute must (along with Brianiac, by the way ...). He can never make me laugh. Better, I think, then THE SANTA CLAUS CONTAINS THE MARTIANS. Some parts of it can still make you shudder or just insinuate yourself. (How many parents do you know, go out for a cocktail on Christmas Eve? "If you get bored, go downstairs and play the piano." I want ...) Freaky, boring, scary, funny, childish, weird ... what more could you want?
