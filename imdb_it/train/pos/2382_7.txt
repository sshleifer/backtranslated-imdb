For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite episode of "Star Trek", although in recent years it has been eclipsed by "City on the Edge of Forever". What I preferred about "Menagerie" was that it was the most intransigent Star Trek with this fascinating background story to the current Trek plot. I still think the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode is ingenious enough. Although the "new" part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and some others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea that Spock is being court-martial is smart. If you want, you can dig holes in the plot. For example, given the Talosian mind control skills and Captain Pike's condition, why is it necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... better not to think too much about the details and enjoy the only two parts of ST.
