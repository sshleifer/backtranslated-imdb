I'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever. Absolutely destroyed, stunned and stunned by the whole picture, wonderful show of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, incredible plot ... Just look inside yourself and show off your courage to admit it ... touched yours soul, because it is strange, but there are all the answers you've always been looking for ... The best, Mr. Ritchie! THE BEST EVER. Those looking for simple stories and skirmishes continue to scream that they are disappointed. But nowadays there are a lot of superficial Hollywood movies, you can't remember what it was the day after you saw it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I never expected it to be possible to portray an image so clear and ingenious of myself, of all those who had to look at it. Absolutely unsurpassed, stunning, dazzling ... You can get insight by looking at this, I have no doubt about it. In fact, no word can express my admiration ... I'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a film after years of dizzying Hollywood trash we were watching. Thank you very much, it is simply the best.
