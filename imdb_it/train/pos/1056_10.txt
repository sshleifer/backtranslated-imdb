How anyone can say that this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. History intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the negative comments and please watch the entire first season before deciding it is bad because I know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go buy season 1 and season 2 on DVD and then join the campaign to get the third season! <br /> <br /> I Hate Fox and I'm sure many "Dark Angel" fans hate them too. They have a thing for Canning Good Shows! Don't you all agree?
