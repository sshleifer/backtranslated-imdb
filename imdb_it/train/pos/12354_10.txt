A wonderful film to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors, like Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of vision, your eyes get stuck on the screen and you do nothing but breathe the atmosphere of the film waiting for what fate will bring to the characters. This film leaves you your standard public position, involves you, makes you part of the story ... The costumes and settings are fantastic; in particular the okiya district is skillfully built. It is certainly not very Akira Kurosawa, however it receives a lot from the master, in particular the stylistic narrative tells us that we are in a distinct land of cinema that is quite far from being Hollywood.
