I was lucky enough to see him in pre-screening last night (October 20th) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and the sincere action of the heart. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story takes place in a way that feels fresh, unique and distinctly "indy" in style. It's not something that can be easily compared to films of the past, it's a unique version of a classic depressed middle-aged love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the casting of the film. Until the last extra in the family, he was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a marvelous job, the talent was uniformly dispersed among them and none of them "shone" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a delightful movie, suitable for all ages and laughs out loud while actually touching and warming the heart. It was a wonderful break from the jokes about sex and the nakedness of recent films.
