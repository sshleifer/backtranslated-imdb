I took the evening to the cinema with a lady friend. The evening is a chick without excuses for being such, but I can say with some relief that it is not so infused with estrogen that it is painful to see a male with red blood. Except for a single example at the end of the film, I watched with interest and didn't have to turn around or roll my eyes at a self-indulgent melodrama. Women, for their part, will absolutely love this movie. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is old, spent in bed and spends her last days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two daughters raised to her side. Baffled by memories of his past, Ann suddenly calls the name of a man his daughters never heard before: Harris. While both her daughters silently contemplate the significance of the mother's strong urge to remember and remedy her unfortunate relationship with this mysterious man all these times, Ann comes back in her head on the fateful day she met Harris - and doing so , lost youthful optimism for the future with which we all inevitably separate. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - one married with children, a serial "commissioner" - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps more importantly, if true love can stand the test of time. Are we all one day destined to realize that love never lasts forever? We all realize that the adjustment for the imperfect is the only realistic result? The subtle fact that the old Ann is still fighting with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost for her two daughters. <br /> <br /> Cinematography for Evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in Ann's mind as she remembers the past, which is why I think the film was shot as if it were all deliberately overexposed, for give everyone an ethereal glow (and therefore make it very obvious that this is not real, but has occurred in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (she seems to be really, really tall, even if only 5'5 "in reality), and she is absolutely captivating in a climatic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test. <br /> <br / > You can't really talk about the cast junk, which leads to Claire Danes and doesn't let go of it: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close complete the other main and minor roles of the film. /> I can not say anything negative about this film, even though Hugh Dancy's struggle to bring out his absolute uniformity character is ultimately a total loss - the richly rich man who puts on a front of great bravado but is secretly afraid of never admitting anything that probably doesn't offer much in the way of exploring the character - he got his orders and attacked them. <br /> <br /> In the end, gentlemen, your friend will surely cry , and while prob skillfully you won't make him feel almost hit, the evening will certainly not be a waste for the time spent watching the evening. Take it in the theaters or take it as a rental to exchange points for when you want to be accompanied to the vision of Die Hard 4 or the next Rambo Flick. It will be your little secret that this vision has not really cost you much.
