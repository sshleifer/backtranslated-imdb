Unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for IMDb amount to a low budget with not good ones. Whatever else this film might need, more budgets really aren't part of it. Big sets and many special effects would have turned it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden is as captivating as the enigmatic Modesty, and this is essential to make this film work. Her wise little smiles and wise looks are formidable, and you find yourself wishing that the camera does not leave her face. It makes it feasible that the naughty Nikolai, also played recently (at least in the United States) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau may have an unusually cerebral interest for her, something Modesty can exploit. He is able to hijack her by raping her and spitting "stop wasting time!" then he rushes among his heavily armed and suddenly wary henchmen. Making such a scene plausible does not happen by chance. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with the Staden fence that Modesty plays is that it's not very credible for her to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscular guy like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. It is simply not a Peta Wilson or a pumped-up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau letting Staden get overwhelmed seems to be just a bad joke with his little sister. <br /> <br /> As this is not really an action movie, this is not a big flaw. I just hope they do better if and when they make sequels.
