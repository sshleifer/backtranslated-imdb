This is not Masterpiece Theater. You shouldn't go in there waiting for you. This is pure FUN girl with the most fantastic cast of female leads. As someone else said, this is the film Baby Mama should have been. And the only downside I see in this movie is that Tina Fey was not a part of it, besides the fact that it is home to the most intelligent and brilliant girls on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, but if you really look at it, you will know that it has many messages and a profound meaning for each of us who would like to be able to go back and do it all over again, knowing what we now know. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
