I first saw this mini-series a few years ago on British television and was immediately fascinated by the story. This rather surprised me because I'm not a big fan of "Jane Eyre" or "Wuthering Heights"; I consider the heroine of the first to be a self-critical boredom, and the last piece of work as an exaggerated touch. <br /> <br /> "The tenant of Wildfell Hall", like the aforementioned works, is also a bit depressing in parts. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the enthusiasm of Helen's escape, the breathtaking wilderness of Yorkshire and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny, represented by the treatment of women in the Markham family. At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate Elena who is married to a wealthy man of high estate, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect. He runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but, as a woman of mystery who lives alone in a rural community, inevitably becomes the object of gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is as excellent as the long-challenging Helen Markham. Not only is he incredibly beautiful (despite that terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most incredible cheekbones, he is also more than capable of interpreting the central role in the film. Tara is dignified and detached while at the same time allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves Arthur Huntingdon is the depraved, yet curiously attractive - after seeing him, I could never have imagined another actor playing that part. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as well as the actress who plays her sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is the unconditional vicar with a taste for the finer things in life. Finally, I could only watch this movie for Toby Stephens; he is so beautiful, robust, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way). I'm not even sure he's a good actor since my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the film it is the use of flashbacks that I have heard both interfered with the movie stream of the story and made it slightly confused. Other people, who saw this movie with me, also had problems with this, and I discovered that I had to explain to them that some scenes were actually retrospective. I am extremely grateful to the people responsible for making this film. Not only did I make the video (a rare event), but it led me to purchase the superb Anne Bronte novel. Of course, this was better than the film, but only with a narrow margin. I recommend anyone interested to watch the film and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
