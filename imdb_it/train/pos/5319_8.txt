Forget that this is a "B" movie. Forget that it is in many ways obsolete. Instead, the writer-director Ida Lupino deserved a lot of credit for addressing a topic that at the time (1950) was a taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, this was the first film to address the issue of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has on its victims. <br /> <br /> Although most of the cast acting is at its best, Mala Powers, who was then eighteen or nineteen, gave an excellent performance for all the traumatized young woman, Ann, who is looking for run away from his "shame". Based on his work in this film, I'm surprised he didn't have a more successful acting career. Even Tod Andrews has some good moments like the minister approaching to help her. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, was nevertheless able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit of the streets and alleys that lead to rape and the line of police that follows him. And it created a bittersweet ending that left me wondering if Ann could really have a normal life again.
