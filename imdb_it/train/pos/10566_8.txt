I never saw this movie and I enjoyed singing and dancing Cagney and the other cast members: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually enters production of Prologues which are shown among the feature films shown in the 1930s of cinema. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. This is a very funny movie with lots of comedy and lots of laughs. Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role that was also very young and pretty. Dick Powell was exceptional as a singer and dancer and has just begun his long and successful career in the screen world. To enjoy.
