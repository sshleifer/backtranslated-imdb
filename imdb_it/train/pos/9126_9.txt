This film is exceptional and wonderfully marked. The Prince's Oscar for music has been widely deserved (many people do not know they have won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A big surprise: Prince does a great acting job, and he's pretty good at conveying pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at their secondary roles. Very cool reference film.
