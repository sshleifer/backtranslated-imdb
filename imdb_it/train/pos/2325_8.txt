Reese Witherspoon plays Dani, a young country girl who falls madly in love with the new 17-year-old Court, played by Jason London. The Court does its best to make Dani understand that the difference in their age would make a love relationship unlikely. Soon the maiden charm of Dani begins to conquer the will of Court. Then comes the meeting of Dani's older sister, played by Emily Warfield, and the beginning of a brief love / jealousy problem. <br /> <br /> Tess Harper and Sam Waterston complete the cast. This is a new, lively spirit; but heartbreaking drama that touches deeply. Feel free to cry.
