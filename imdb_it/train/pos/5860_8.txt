A fun game that offers fun and easy play and good reproduction skills. Staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something you don't see in most action cartridges today. Furthermore, the narration and the animated scenes used (although the long animations are replaced by the presentations of the Nintendo 64 version) take full advantage of the platform's capabilities.
