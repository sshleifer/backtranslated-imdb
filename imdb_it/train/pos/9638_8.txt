This film was more a transition to adulthood for a gay man, and how he should behave with everyone. His mother is depressed, her younger sister is a pain, her older sister somehow accepts. The relationship looks good with her boyfriend / exhooker and leaves her family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy fucks on him and says that it really doesn't mean anything. Our young homosexual goes crazy and ends up in the looney bin and eventually goes away, letting his new lover out and starting over. We stayed with him to start over and see, not participate, in happiness. So maybe things will be better for him in the future. The ending was a bit downer but the whole movie was completely realistic and so I'll let this real ending be a hello with a high rating.
