Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl named Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.? <br /> <br /> What happens: four dinosaurs (see above) are fed with some "brain grain cereal" and now they are cuddly and friendly dinosaurs that will be kind to children. They go to New York with big projects ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this is a cute animated film. The animation of the dinosaurs when they become cuddly and friendly is a bit flabby and not very good, but in any case they are equally pleasing in the same way. I like dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters present, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I also like the others. Overall, I really like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: People who like children's animated films, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses are not always what they seem ?? To enjoy! :-)
