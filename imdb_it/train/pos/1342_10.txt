A compelling and wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easy to relate to his works, especially the previous ones, the era of silence. Very funny despite being a bit long, I found this one of the best documentaries on cinema. Forced vision if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
