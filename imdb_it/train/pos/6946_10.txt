24 was the best espionage / adventure series that TV has ever broadcast. The whole idea of ​​telling a story in a real 24-hour period is dazzling. The style of shooting and rhythm is what keeps us looking at it. And Jack Bauer has been one of the greatest protagonists of a TV series for a long time. I consider this, along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three favorite TV series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate American Senator David Palmer, who is also a presidential candidate. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind all this and, at the same time, to understand his daughter's path to the unaware after escaping from her bedroom. Thus begins an adventure on the best political style and, what is better, is that it always takes place in real time, which makes this TV series a real work of originality at a time when it seems that every program on TV you show us the same things again and again and again and again.
