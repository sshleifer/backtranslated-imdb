I saw this film before returning home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. I think the film itself is a true masterpiece. It's the kind of film that people should do. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and a businessman who has lost his taste for life until he meets a man with Down syndrome who lives in an institution with other patients with Down syndrome. Actors including the actor who actually has Down syndrome create a credible friendship and a relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours change forever with the man of Down syndrome. He realizes that life is not just work and not gaming, but for living and love and this is what life should be. The ending is pretty stupid, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. Just bring a tear to the eyes.
