MGM wasn't sure how to market Garbo when it arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had great faith in her and his appearance in "Torrent" justified him. He didn't speak a word of English so he must have found it difficult to work, even Ricardo Cortez didn't make it very easy for her. <br /> <br /> The stream of the title is the Juscar river that winds a small sleepy village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes one day that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot convince her to consent to his marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) evicted Leonora's parents from their home and sent Leonora to Paris, hoping to give her the chance to continue her singing career. Leonora sends a note to Rafael, urging him to remember his promise and accompany her. His mother is furious and forbids him to go, so obviously he gives in to his request. <br /> <br /> The years pass. Leonora has a new identity: she became La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael turned out just as his mother wanted: he is looking for an office and is courting a "safe" girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead) who is a "pig" heiress. Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old house, and I agree: because she didn't help her mother out. His mother still lives in the family home, works as a skivvy and is washing. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so lovely, it's hard to believe he can be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam is bursting and the stream is flooding the city. Leonora's house is on the way to the river, but when Rafael tries to save her, she finds she is safe. Then they rekindle their love story. There is a "horizontal" love scene in this film, very similar to that of "Flesh and the Devil". Dona Brull spreads gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora's mother believes her and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora just before going on tour in America. Again he plans to go with her, but again he will disappoint her. He spends so much time listening to other people who destroy his reputation - "what he will do for you but he will drag you down". The irony is that she has just secured a high-ranking position in the government for him if he comes with her. They meet again, years later - she is fresh and vibrant as ever - she looks older than her years, bent by mediocrity. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a good movie with a positive message to follow your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupid, the barber and Leonora's old and faithful friend. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
