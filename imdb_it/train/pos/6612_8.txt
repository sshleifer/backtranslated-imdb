Just as Final Fantasy has taken CG to a whole new level, this is a resurgence for motion capture. Neither films nor cartoons, this film looks like a tribute to the film Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. See Paris as it could be, the characters look as real as you and me. They blink, travel, shiver like real actors in a way never before achieved. <br /> <br /> Don't go see it hoping to find a mental tornado. You'll probably understand it before you're halfway through the film. The scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to the famous thrillers, but this is certainly a pleasure for the eyes.
