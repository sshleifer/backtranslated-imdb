I'm not a fan of the latest films, but this was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! My aunt liked it too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and his family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping his resolution in mind to find his friend, Marie. Highly recommended.
