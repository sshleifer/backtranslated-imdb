Almost 5 years have passed since the release of this elegant action movie. I saw this movie almost 10 times and this was a great Gautham effort. From my point of view, I feel that this film is practically perfect. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt..classy.Jyothika played her role as Maya very well. The character looks very good on her. The character that caught the attention of the films was Pandia. Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well. Brutal and scary. Jeevan deservedly received the Best Villain award in ITFA 2004. The supporting cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> Racy's script, perfect dialogues and Gautham's brilliant narrative. The Harris Jeyaraj soundtrack is all paper-based, while the BGM fits the film very well. The director of RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the stunts well. Anthony's editing is accurate. Furthermore, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop full of right amounts of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can't compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
