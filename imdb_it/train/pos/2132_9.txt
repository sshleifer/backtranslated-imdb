The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal love-type-woman-quarrel-all-time-but-wind-in-love-type of Hollywood romance / romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> I don't usually go for that kind of movie and that tiring storyline, but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play every other good and make a very nice pair. The supporting cast is exceptional - from the very nice Felix Bressart to the evil Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in his career. He takes the film and turns it into a completely different mood for a while when something dramatic happens to him. That "twist" is another reason why this film is above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of this. In this film, it's love story, comedy and drama and it's well done. I will take this check on the repetition of "You got Got Mail" every day. No comparison.
