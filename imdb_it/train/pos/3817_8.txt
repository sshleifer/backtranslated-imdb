If you've had a drama in your life, or yours or someone close to you, this woman's pain phases (but, in my opinion, could easily be a man too) go through a very real reality. It's a film about not being able to deal with your pain, about not knowing what to do to help you overcome it. Obviously, therefore, it is also a film about not knowing how to help someone close to overcoming pain. It is a film that makes you understand that everyone is alone in their suffering. It is a film that could push someone beyond the limit ... which hardly seems like a recommendation. I'm not sure I'd recommend someone to go and see this movie, especially someone close by, but for me ... it's a film that puts things in perspective, shows real pain, and it's therefore very important to be alive. It makes you understand that hey, you or the person close to you have experienced pain, that hey, all the things you worry about now are so unimportant
