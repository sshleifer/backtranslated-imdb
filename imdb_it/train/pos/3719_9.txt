I just got it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a beautiful story, told convincingly. The camcorder approaches action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes (in a documentary style, not Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a large budget to produce a compelling film. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor who focused the events in the film, Boz.
