It's been a long time since I saw this mini series and I'm happy to say that his remembered merits have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of 'A Perfect Spy', the adaptation of the best novel by LeCarré, in my opinion, are the best. Exceptional aspects are the musical score and the masterly script, the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also, I believe, the screenwriter of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' with Alec Guinness a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly very good, some superb, like Jack Brotherhood by Alan Howard and Ricky Pym by Ray McAnally. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle. The passing of time and the effects on the physical appearances of the characters are made in a very credible way. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of shooting. The only shock comes after the character of Magnus Pym was transferred from the skilled hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a powerful and too old Peter Egan, just out of Oxford. But this is a minor and insignificant strand in the complex. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulty convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and needs to be emotionally "upset", that is, to cry. None of the actors has a very easy time with these moments, apart from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all that is worth and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is as annoying as Mary Pym. She has a part of the character under her skin, but she often shows an amateur petulanza that belittles her as a diplomatic housewife with hard biscuits, which is Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is as splendid as Axel, funny, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's turn as a baroness. <br /> <br /> The British vision of Americans is vividly rendered in some dry and hilarious scenes. When the Yankees came abroad to confabulate with Bo Brammell (head of MI6) the American contingent is portrayed as an empty-headed buffoon who seems to have memorized a lot of long words from the Dictionary and seasoned them liberally with jargon American and psychological chatter, with great contempt by the British. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are subtly mixed. LeCarré has a talent for mixing disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy and melancholic atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> It is not a perfect production (what is it?) Yet the best of LeCarré's adaptations to reach movies or television to date. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all espionage enthusiasts and especially for LeCarré fans. DVD available from Acorn.
