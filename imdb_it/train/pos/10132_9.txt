In this first episode of Friends, we are presented with the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We find out that Rachel, a rich girl who has been a friend of Monica's since high school, has left her boyfriend, Barry, at the altar since he discovered he didn't love him. He also decides to live with Monica and become independent of his father, finding a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, found out that his wife is a lesbian and lost her to his partner Susan. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, seeks (and eventually sleeps) with Paul "the wine boy", who gave her the excuse of be impotent since he divorced his wife. But in reality, he was only deceiving her. <br /> <br /> Ps: I love the cuts of Joey and Chandler in this first season! =)
