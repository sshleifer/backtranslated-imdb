This film has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this movie far outweigh the bad guys ... <br /> <br /> What's not so good about the movie is sometimes the dialogue, the sounds, lighting (I'm the only one who noticed the way the sets were turned on was amateur, and the acting .... <br /> <br /> What is very good are the highly original plot, the very intense atmosphere, the cold blood factor that is very high, and the effects that are made in a supreme way. <br /> <br /> So, it's definitely worth looking at, or maybe even a must-see for everyone you fans of horror and smoke ....
