"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about pets. It deserves a place among the great films of its kind and also the world of cinema in general, along with other animal films like "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". This means that it is more than a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Can this be just a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know him by heart, since the early teenage years (when I was 12). <br /> <br /> It is a film for families to cherish. It's exciting, electrifying, adventurous, exciting, fun, fun, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, moving and sometimes dramatic. It is one of those films that makes the faces of those who appreciate this type of film smile. <br /> <br /> This film is not lacking in quality. It has a well thought history, fun characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling landscapes and landscapes of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). About the landscapes, they are not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... in conclusion, all the wonders of pure nature - truly a complete panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are nice, well developed and well represented by their respective actors. Robert Hays is as fantastic as the kind-hearted dad, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is as good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is as conventional as his younger and nicer brother Jamie (his appearance reminds me a lot of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is as fantastic as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our four-legged friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the old faithful Golden Retriever, wise, mature, handsome, caring and loving (brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche). The case, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). The probability cannot stand still. Sassy is the epitome of the image of cats: elegant, independent, very confident and proud, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Himalayan Seal Point cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are, by themselves, great "actors" by nature: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It is an undervalued film, but it is a classic in its own right. His sequel is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
