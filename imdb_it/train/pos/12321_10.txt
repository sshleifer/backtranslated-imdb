I saw this movie in my childhood. And after 10 years I don't remember anything about this film, but I discovered that I don't even know how I managed to discover this film. It's my life. My favorite movie of all time. My words do not respond to the true meaning of what I have inside for this film. I follow this movie. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, eroticism, fear and martial arts. The history of the power of love is rather touching and warm. It is a masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman, is without doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made in the cinema. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is an unfortunate young man who goes in search of a monastery for lodging, deep in the woods, a place where the villagers seem to be very afraid to approach. The trek alone is dangerous with wolves, and a mad Taoist monk lives at the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious girl who also lives nearby in a desert temple. She is forced to seduce men for her evil lover, but when she meets the innocent Ling Choi Sin she falls in love with them. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of crazy idiot but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods. There are great martial arts, even a monk who explodes into a drunken song while performing in Taoist sword ritual forms. The film makes a lot of traditional old martial arts acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film really flows, and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing must be married to a bad tree monster, which can't be good, and we feel his situation in his home where we meet his sisters and stepmother who is not really beautiful. <br /> end they must fight a witch with a deadly tongue, and go with Yin to the heart of hell to fight a millennial evil to save their souls and bring back the ashes of Ling to her home for a proper burial so that he can have a chance for reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to details. One is touched in many ways by this film, laugh, cry and have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And even if at the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride in the morning sun under an enchanting rainbow, we never know if Tsing has been granted a reincarnation, but we know it.
