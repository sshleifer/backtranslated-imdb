Once again Jet Li brings her charismatic presence to the screen of the movie Black Mask. In this film, Li plays Tsui, a fugitive from a super-soldier program that tries to recover the humanity that the program has taken from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate asks that he clean up the problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super-soldier program had fled the same time as Tsui, but want to keep up with the world rather than find inner peace. So Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from releasing information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This movie screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. Martial arts are incredible, but because they use threads, they may not be appreciated as much as the American public deserves. If you like action movies that have an interesting history and require good acting performances because they face both physical and psychological conflicts, Black Mask is for you. I am pleased to see that some of the Jet Li films are finally coming out in the United States and I can't wait to see how the changes that this publication will require (things like dubbing and the soundtrack) will affect the film. This is one of Li's best films, going out and seeing it on May 14th when it comes out in America.
