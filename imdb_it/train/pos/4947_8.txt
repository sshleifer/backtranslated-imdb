One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It all depends on loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I didn't like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what's wrong? That smile can melt diamonds. It is so fantastic that I can watch whatever it is. The same goes for Freeman. it's simply magical on the screen. <br /> <br /> The two gave us a fun movie from beginning to end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine and Bobby to Packy. He was tender, charming and simply funny. <br /> <br /> You need to take a look at this.
