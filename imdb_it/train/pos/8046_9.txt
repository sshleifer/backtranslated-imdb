Who knew they could be so funny ?? Christopher Meloni and Janel Moloney are known for their outstanding work in some of the hottest television dramas. ("Law & Order: SVU" and "The West Wing") Put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> Actors develop the ongoing story relationship with impressive abilities, leaving the public forced to fall in love with Barry Singer (Meloni), despite being a stand-up comedian who is also a sexist, mean asshole. <br /> <br /> I will cheer for him even if he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases Thea (Moloney) halfway into the country hoping to win his heart. They have so little in common ... but when Barry finally opens his heart, you'll wonder why Thea continues to run away. <br /> <br /> The Souler Opposite is a wonderful film with an incredible cast and a talented writer. It's worth your time. <br /> <br />
