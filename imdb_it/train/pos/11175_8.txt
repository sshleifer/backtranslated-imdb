So often with Stephen King's adaptations, you only have a collection of characters who recite the dialogue from books. This really captures the heart of the book. Perhaps because they DO NOT use large pieces of text directly from the book, but it is a bit more than an improvisation of events in history. Much of his success is Miko Hughes as baby gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really behave like her parents. There's a scene where Louis is cuddling Gage, and they're very natural together. Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL. It perfectly covers the Maine accent without falling into parody, and is wise and warm just like Jud should be. (8 of 10)
