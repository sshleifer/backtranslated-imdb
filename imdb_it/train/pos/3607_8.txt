So I turned on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I'd spend half an hour watching "Girlfight" while I waited for "Hart's War" to begin. With a title like that I thought it was a 'B' flic exploitation of gangs of girls from the inner city. <br /> <br /> To my surprise it was not like that at all. Instead it is a well-acted and well-written story about a young woman who almost accidentally enters women's boxing. He is responsible for bringing his younger brother to his practice sessions and is interested while observing his periods. Since he doesn't really want to be a boxer (just following his father's wishes), he convinces his coach to take her to his place. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as it passes through various tests in its research. To begin with, his brother's trainer doesn't want to hire a woman boxer. Having reluctantly done, there is the problem of lining up the games for her. Then the confrontation with his father when he finds out what's going on. Yes, a love interest develops, but it serves to improve the plot, discovering more than an interesting inter-human reaction with its own consequences linked to the struggle. <br /> <br /> All in all it is a small sleeping film that few seem to have heard of. Some time later, when I saw the much publicized and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby", I thought "wait a minute, this seems familiar". Needless to say, I didn't watch "Hart's War" that evening.
