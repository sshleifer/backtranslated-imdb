Honestly, I find this movie too depressing for my sake. It is VERY depressing until almost the end. I can in no way justify the judgment on a character who did things I didn't like (well, apart from the disgusting character played by Fredrick Forrest). But it's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way, putting walls around themselves just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing. <br /> <br /> A horrible tragedy hits a Montana family. They believe they have lost a child, but it turns out they have lost 2. The key is, if they only communicate and face their pain together, they will not end up losing their second child permanently. <br /> <br /> But they can't. Something is preventing this family from sharing their pain. Some families retire in silence and resentment while other people point their finger at (and then go ahead and betray their poor pregnant wife by seducing the beautiful girlfriend of the deceased ... that Andy's character is really a snake!) the only member of the family that is not threatening Arnold in any way is his grandfather (Wilford Brimley). Grandpa seems to be able to talk to the boy without judgments or even children's gloves. He seems to know what the child is thinking even though Arnold isn't saying much these days. It is indeed a blessing for the poor boy to have that one person to turn to. No one else seems to grasp the fact that Arnold could be shocked, denied or that his way of crying is not the same style, or at the same speed, as one would expect. It is so easy to judge and get angry and hear someone being "made of stone" just because they don't grieve in a way that we believe they should. <br /> <br /> The plot is very quiet and naturalistic. You will certainly not get a spoiled narration or some good Hollywood resolution. I was very worried that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt the need to hitchhike for several hundred miles to apologize to the wife of that Andy pig for something he shouldn't blame. Arnold may have accidentally killed his brother, but no one is responsible for the end of that marriage, which apparently was bad, except for the two people in the marriage. It's just a stupid fortune that Arnold didn't get in the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are as frustrating and effective as parents who somehow cannot find the communication with their child by themselves, to find out what Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, whom I haven't seen anywhere else except for his childhood favorite called EXPLORERS and a gruesome ghost story called THE LADY IN WHITE, did an incredible job as Arnold, a great performance by a child actor. <br /> <br /> Besides being a little slow at times, THE STONE BOY is an excellent and very depressing film.
