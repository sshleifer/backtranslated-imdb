Originally it was to be a movie in which Gene Kelly would have acted, but when the creators failed to get it they got "the greatest actor in the world", and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is having trouble doing what he does best, creating a crap game because he needs $ 1000 to get the job. So to get the money he needs, he has a $ 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) who can't get Sergeant Sarah Brown (winner of Great Expectations Golden Globe and Jean Simmons BAFTA candidate) to go with him to Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants her to ask for her hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley like Big Jule. An interesting romantic musical comedy, with Brando singing all his songs, and Sinatra is fluid and fashionable. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Set, Best Photography, Best Stage Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, was named BAFTA for Best Film from Any Source and Won the Golden Globe for Best film - Musical / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 in The 100 greatest pop culture icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 in The 100 greatest movie stars, was number 11 on I 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, was number 4 in 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was number 1 in The greatest actor in the world, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for, the film was number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals, and was number 36 on The 100 greatest musicals. Very good!
