With a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a plot that twists the strings of the heart more than a rock guitarist, "Seven Pounds" surpasses the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a film I also loved. Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of his films could go unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is not as high profile. <br /> <br /> Too bad I understood Will Smith's scheme at the beginning, I made two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and in the scene where Rosario Dawson's character is introduced like an incurable heart -disease. <br /> <br /> However, I still think that the writer / director has made the right choice by putting the bookends (the books are the first and the last scene) in that way, it is the source of urgency and tension in the film, gradually discovering how exactly a man can be guided to that extreme sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of his mind what was in store for these two unfortunates. <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the film thought that the character of Smith could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when he is in the presence of his chosen seven, yet at other times it may be hard and frightening, and when it is only t the whole weight of his situation has cost him too much and he breaks completely. It's a pretty versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can't forget to mention the re-enactment of the crash scene, which was really amazingly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. Put this on your list.
