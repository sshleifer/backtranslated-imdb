I liked The Lonely Lady. Take a break at Pia. He looks good and has really nice eyes. What's wrong? The scene in which she was raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was a gross and cruel thing. In reality, MANY things that happen in this film are crude and cruel. But it's a trash movie. A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad. I liked Much better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not only boring but also boring. At least this was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia undresses a lot and looks uncomfortable as a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a boy who is three times his age is absolutely incredible. I'm sure Pia is a good person in real life, but she doesn't project the atmosphere of the writer. She seemed a lot happier when she worked as a hostess for that Saturday Night Fever guy and wore a shiny disco dress. <br /> <br /> A couple of scenes are fun. The one in which he tells the actress with two times to be pregnant and he looks up and snaps at her "stop wandering!", All the while he's practically courting every kid who jumps nearby. <br /> <br /> Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. Probably it was a mistake to go up like this over the supernova (the vortex of floating faces and frozen cry - whoa!) And its subsequent catatonic astonishment is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The acceptance speech is a cry, though. I want to see someone give that speech in an acting class. <br /> <br /> But again, this is rubbish we are talking about. You could find worse in every movie of the week in the 1980s.
