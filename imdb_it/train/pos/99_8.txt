A Christmas together came before my time, but I grew up with John Denver and the songs on this special have always been my family's Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I finally managed to track down a video on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for about 21 years, I could see John and the Muppets in action for myself. If you get the chance, it's a lot of fun - great music, warmth of heart and cheese. It is also interesting to see the versions of the Muppets of the 1970s and compare them with their most recent versions today. I think Denver actually took a bit of warmth to do a show like this - I guess normally artists don't compromise their images by making them sing with the Muppets, but I'm glad they did. Even if you can't find the video, the soundtrack is also worthwhile. It has some traditional Muppified favorites, but also some original Denver songs.
