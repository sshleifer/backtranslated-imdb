updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or musical dramas, to be more precise, (Meistersinger is the other.) although it's hard to imagine it as the "top of anyone" pops ". The libretto, as usual of the composer, is a mixture of religion, paganism, eroticism and perhaps also homoeroticism, and its length could make the public seem to feel the dried paint. <br /> <br /> Wagner , being a famous anti-Semite, (Klingsor could be one of his bad Jewish surrogates.) of course he entrusted the former to an unconverted (not for lack of RW is rehearsing!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Go to understand!) Kundry, a very mixed policeman and another Jewish surrogate, is both wicked and benevolent, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Considering that many video versions of Parsifal seem seriously on the side, this film of the opera is, by comparison, a breath of fresh air Hans-Jürge n Syberberg, the director, brought a lot of imagination, but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices. For example: the infamous double Parsifal (of any kind!), The marionettes, the mask of Wagner's death and various dolls and symbols like the Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (If I recall, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the actual music to adjust the scene changes.) Even though Wagner himself died too early to be a true Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife Cosima ). they were at least fellow travelers, including their nephew Wolfgang Wagner who still runs the Bayreuth Festival in old age. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, in complete opposition to his father, tried to deal honestly with his great-grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically ambiguous from what I've read. In 1977 he made a famous film about Hitler, "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes called in English "Our Hitler"). Since it lasts all 8 hours and has not been widely distributed, many people have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the host of the audio CD on which this film is based, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play the double Parsifal ( both sung by Reiner Goldberg!) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the work takes place over a long period of time and everyone (except Kundry?) has been described as remarkably aged in Acts 2 and 3, no one seems older than a day by the end of lyric music. (The magic of the Grail? In this work the Grail is the chalice from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and not to Mary Magdalene as in more recent times, an idea that I find absurd!). <br /> <br /> conducting and singing are all quite useful and the DVD seems to have improved the sound, if not the image, to a large extent. (Yes, I agree that the "Kna" approach is superior, even in the second stereo version, but it is probably superior to all the versions recorded as a whole.) <br /> <br /> It is not a Parsifal for all Wagners, but I think it works quite well as an opera.
