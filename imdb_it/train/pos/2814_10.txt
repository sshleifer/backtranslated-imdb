This is the best film ever made to address the topic of AIDS. It is a documentary about two men who live and die of this disease. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and incredibly moving. Above all, it is an extraordinary real love story. Make sure you have some kegs ready before watching this movie --- you'll need them. Extraordinary.
