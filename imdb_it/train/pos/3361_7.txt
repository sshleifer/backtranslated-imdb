I intended to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of Marcello Mastroianni with several of his unclaimed films that I own on VHS; however, given my continuous Christmas marathon, I had to settle for this! As it happened, it is characterized by one of his best interpretations - and he was rightly nominated for an Oscar for this (with the film itself being also honored). This was also one of the 14 collaborations with the most widely recognized star to emerge from Italy, Sophia Loren; both, incidentally, are playing against the guy here - she's like a glorious housewife and he's a homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the protagonists are gathered on the historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself is shown in long archive sequences) , but more specifically it refers to the "brief encounter" of the stars in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, briefly, passion - even if everyone knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to the film's sharp bittersweet ending . This is practically a two-hander (with all the other characters - except for the nosy condominium porter where the story takes place in its entirety - which includes the gruff husband and fervently patriotic husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, appear only to the start and end sequences); still, the cramped environment does not discourage the director Scola (for the record, this is the seventh film of which I saw and the owner of another 3 on VHS) and the director of photography Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result - also if essentially low - key - it is anything but random: the camera is allowed to wander between the various sections of the large building, observing the procedure as intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires, but always acutely. <br /> <br /> The narration obviously depends entirely on the performance of the two stars to be convincing, and both versions (their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable); it is interesting, however, that while Loren has moved away with the prizes in her own land, she is the moving but not sentimental outsider of Mastroianni (the film, somewhat doubtful, seems to equate her sexual deviance with anti-fascism!) generally hit the international audience!
