Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathroom in China. There are no fancy sets, explosions or fascinating people - only excellent writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, take note!). <br /> <br /> An estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised to find that Dad looks good and is handling family business as usual. In fact, he notes that his father and his late brother have forged an intimate and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son comes from the big city and he doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse. How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and credible. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see that not all Chinese films are action scenes (like those with Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), since I don't particularly care about these hectic movies. The Shower and Springtime In A Small Town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE!
