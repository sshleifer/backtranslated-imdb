I gave this film a 10 because it had to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors AND my god the engineering! The fact is that I don't want to tell anyone about acting or history because it would ruin the film. But I will advise you to go directly to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it! (Don't forget popcorn!)
