The short film that begins this film is the real movie of a boy named Gary, apparently he was taken at random in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the city of Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; he is an imitator and leads an old Chevy called Farrah (after Fawcett). And here the filmmaker receives a letter from Gary some time later inviting him to return to Beaver to get some footage of the local talent competition he put together, including Gary's amazing performance as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The two short films that follow are the story of Gary, the same one you just saw the first is played by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover entitled "The Orkly Kid". If you're in the mood to make fun of someone, this is definitely the movie to watch. I was panicked for most of it, especially for the Crispins performance that could stand alone. When it was over, I had to rewind the film to look again at the real Gary and all his brilliant idiocy. Although Olivia was the center of attention, I would have liked to have seen one of the "fictitious" shorts make a shot of the impersonation of Gary's Barry Manilow, which was equally ridiculous.
