I only saw him once. This happened in 1952, I was seven, the film 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I kept in mind, forever, the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I understood that moment when a people can hardly be presented and used by a foreign nation. In these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, that raised among people who share daily life, who see themselves, who know each other, but who belong to different worlds, can just appear. Then, in the most critical moments a problematic question emerges: "Who are we, first and foremost, should we be loyal?", Which people, family, motherland, the person you know near you. You don't have the time to give a perfect answer, the urgency is there, and it's for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with the sacrifice of himself. Somewhere, confusedly, a problem remains unresolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to many other fictions or realities that we can see today, because this death, this I lived the only life to disappear, I shared an unconditional friendship with my child. It was experienced by the viewer that I was. That day I lost Gunga-Din forever. When I left behind, later, my beautiful childhood, as I left from so many worlds in which I lived. I left everything forever and these lines are now a brief visit that I did not expect to do this morning when I got up.
