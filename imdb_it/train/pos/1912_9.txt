I'll keep it short and short, the people who wrote the stories for this show are brilliant, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (the character of CJ is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on the screen that makes it what it is , a highly successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the new episodes that are likely to go back a little over 6/7 months, I wondered what had happened to Paul. I was gutted to find out he was dead when I flipped through Google. He was so funny and played his character perfectly, an overprotective father who likes to keep his daughters away from the limelight and away from the boys. <br /> <br /> The play, I think, went from strength to strength, even without Paul in it. <br /> <br /> Also, I think most people would enjoy watching it.
