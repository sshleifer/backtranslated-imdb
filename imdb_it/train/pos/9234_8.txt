Reportage based on real historical events, this epic disturbing violent, bloody and shocking episode supports the interest of the spectators creating a verisimilitude that is missing in most films set in a remote era. The portrait of Madame Bolkan's rebellious nun is a tour de force. His gradual transformation into character from an obedient accomplice if not included in the social injustices of his time is skillfully demonstrated by telling sequences: his testimony of the ambitious raping activity of the local Duke, his forbidden love relationship with a Jew, his criminal defection against the Muslim invasion the forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) In this film there are some painfully realistic gory sequences (human flaying) that are not for the fussy, but spectators with a strong stomach and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest. It deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to the Hollywood representations of the medieval world.
