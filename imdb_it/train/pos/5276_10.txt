I joined IMDb so people know what a great movie is! It is not often that you come across a moving and visually cinematic but humble film. You read the plot so all I want to say is don't look at it because you want to see a clash of religious cultural identity babble, because this is the typical misunderstanding that people read, instead of appreciating and realizing that it's a father and son in a journey that grows to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it before film4 gets there. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for an independent and foreign BAFTA. The beauty is that it manages to please anyone, even if you never look at anything with subtitles or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you busy. The only thing I want is for it to be longer and see what happens
