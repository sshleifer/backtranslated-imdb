The unlikely pair of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte unite to give us some interesting interpretations and subjects in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting twist on the themes of It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly poor Jews in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis had prevented him from working. Kaminsky is largely bedridden. It is reduced to applying for wellness. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he asks God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, perhaps, if he had someone like Henry Travers, things might have worked differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had a thing for him, he was over 100 years from this deadly spiral and all his ties to earthly things were gone. God sent Mostel something completely different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte who should have at least received basic training for angels before receiving an assignment. <br /> <br /> Belafonte has not accepted to be out of life, it still has a lot of problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know that he passed by, hit by a car at the very beginning of the film. You have posed his problems and the issues of Mostel and you have had a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel cannot believe a black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance for Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who won a Best Actress nomination in the Main Street shop some years ago. The other important role here is that of the Irish actor Milo O'Shea who plays a good Jewish doctor. Recalling O'Shea's brogue of The Verdict, I was really surprised to see him and hear him take the doctor's part. <br /> <br /> The Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It was created by a stellar cast and, of course, created by acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure to take it during the transmission.
