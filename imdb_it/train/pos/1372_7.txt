"Party Girl" takes advantage of the incredible charm of Parker Posey. In fact, at times, the film seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey is allowed to interpret herself, as is usually the case in real life. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a pleasure for Mrs Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild journey through Lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the different clubs that she constantly attends. This was an era that was even more naive than that area and the adjacent neighborhoods of the Meat Market. At least, there are no claims in the movies and we see people on earth taking their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes a wonderful Mary. It is because of Parker Posey that we enjoy the movie more than if another actress played Mary. She is the whole image. The rest of the cast is good.
