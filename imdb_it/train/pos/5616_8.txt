What can be said, actually ... "The Tenant" is a first-class thriller beaten with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. It is an intricate film - every detail seems to be included for a reason - even if the plot rarely makes sense, and in large part it is not even addressed objectively. So we stayed with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - a mild Polish who got an apartment due to the suicide of the previous tenant - to guide us through a world of growing fear and uncertainty. After a holiday warmed up by the apartments launched by a group of hideous colleagues, Trelkovskij is subjected to an apparently inexplicable examination of the other occupants in his palace; the rest of the film tells of his mental deterioration and gives us a complete mind * on a par with David Lynch's subsequent efforts. "The Tenant", however, is darker and more sinister, imbued with an unexpected comic effect, excellent performances and a truly haunting soundtrack. It's a film that has a better experience than the one described, so skip it.
