After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as beautiful as this show. Well, I'm wrong! Lost is fascinating! I love this show and I can't turn it off. The richness of the characters, the complexity of the plot, the splendid setting are all incredible. I am totally and completely hooked. I don't know how creators do it, but every character touches me deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right deep inside !!! I don't have the cable, so I rented the series on Netflix. When I turn it on, I watch all the episodes simultaneously and feel sad when it's over. I can't wait for the next record to arrive at my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
