It's time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent death, but this film is not the only one. His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his best works. <br /> <br /> This film made attempts in 1973 to prophesy a future land, in 2022, which is so overpopulated that the human race was manipulated by the authorities to eat a universal food product called "Soylent Green" which it is manufactured with human flesh. This bizarre and improbable film was ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and supposes that the population of India which would be around 2 billion from that stage would then be meat eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character who overcomes the secret international conspiracy that world powers have devised to meet the nutritional needs of overpopulation using cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they convey is not the Green Party of today's ethos Thank God. Cannibalism has been practiced by indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until just 40 years before this film was made, but it has long been abandoned by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another silly prediction in the film is that women become sex slaves turning back to radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made. <br /> <br /> The film was stupid then and it is so silly now but it contains a film not very memorable performance of the late Edward G. Robinson, but it is still not a valid reason to revisit the film except for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a real disaster for a movie and I wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film I read all look the same to a dystopian society where the centralized theme seems to involve only the United States where an ecological disaster has occurred. <br /> <br /> only the merit in the film is that the earth faces overpopulation.
