From time to time, I stated that if people don't want to redo or sequel facts, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent cinema. That said, though, the last time I saw an independent film I must have been with ease six months ago. So here's a review for an indie on which I caught my attention on Youtube; the Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately, we can say that the film stands for an avant-garde cinematic approach that is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups, scopophilia and fast editing. He is proud of how it looks - and he has the right to be. For the most part it is a small piece very well done, except for an unforgivable contempt for the 180 degree rule and a comical bad shooting effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self-financed projects. <br /> However, despite these amateur mistakes, most of the shots are actually a pleasure to watch. We are presented with a good use of props and settings, good visual acting and a bit of fluid and very atmospheric editing, made more commendable because it is definitely something that you won't see very often from a Youtube presentation. The plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is quite simple, some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing here is the narration of avant-gardes at work; you can't really expect a simple three-act structure and if you do you may not be ready for this type of film. <br /> <br /> Where the film is unfortunately disappointed, however, is the sound. What you will hear is a distorted voice that often sounds insincere and worse is continuous background music, which goes through minimal changes and does not add much to anything. So much attention is given to the images that the audio frankly neglects, and this becomes really evident when you realize that you have just lost about four sentences of the narration and you have to go back to collect what has escaped your attention. <Br /> <br /> So, give him a watch, but do it with the sound turned off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Did anyone remember the cover of Doug Naylor's "Red Human" Red Dwarf novel at the beginning of the film? If you have the book, you know what I mean.
