I only saw him because he played Josie Lawrence, whom I knew from Whose Line is it Anyway ?, the extravagant British improv comedy <br /> <br />. I was pleasantly surprised by this moving and magical gem. It is uplifting, touching, and <br /> romantic without being mushy or sentimental. The characters are <br /> <br /> all real people, with real pains, fears and needs. Watch it.!
