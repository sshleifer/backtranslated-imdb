Going to see Seven Pounds I wasn't sure what to think, because the previews left a lot open to understand what it really was. So within the first 20 minutes or so you're completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All this ends when the "twist", so to speak, is revealed at the last minute of the film. Basically Tim (smith) was upset and persecuted by a serious accident that killed seven people. With this he decides to identify seven new people who need help badly from those who in turn give their lives. <br /> <br /> The acting of this film is great, as I feel it will be smith, no matter what part seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of his best films, apart from the eagle eye that I think is up there. He's got a little ugly, but in this movie he does it. Other actors, like Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a role big enough to understand the character. Although the casting of the film was still good. <br /> <br /> This film was definitely not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace in which I was hoping. The film, however, was still quite good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the film and everything settles down. Until then it seems a useless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
