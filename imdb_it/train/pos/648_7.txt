I decided to look at this because of the recommendations of this site. I should say that it was worth it. However, you should be careful that this film will go on for 210 minutes. If you don't have the power to stay, take it on tape and watch it for a couple of nights. <br /> <br /> Now at the movie, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't, take a look, here: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promiscuous tramp, a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an elderly woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and she supplies Alex. Alex spends his days in bars and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously imbued Gilberte with whom he used to live. Gilberte dumped it for a less attractive man who didn't like it because Alex had mistreated and beaten her. At this point, Alex was willing to find a job and help raise their child before he discovered that Gilberte had miscarried and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they have a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and have had a ménage à trois. Finally, it is revealed that Veronika is pregnant with Alex's son and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as mentioned in Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will also get a job and be the supplier of his new love and his family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title of "La Maman et la putain", I deduce that Jean Eustache was related to the character of Veronika by Françoise Lebrun. She was a whore and then became the mother. So are the mother and the whore the same person? Anyway, what I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, without political purpose, preachers, theatrical, insipid, plaintive and full of quotations. Lebrun and Léaud played their stubborn characters well and held the film together, as part of the script became a bit lost and messed up. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad effort. 7/10.
