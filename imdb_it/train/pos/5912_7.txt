by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is film, by the one and only Ralph Bakshi, is referred to as a satirical accusation of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at black life in the Modern America (modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just caught fire. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi film, controversial, electrifying and absolutely not to be missed almost by definition. Not just another random "shock-jock" of a film that tries to shock for the sake of the shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a film, he has something big to say ... <br /> <br /> Although his roots are based on cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another Campy knock-offs off the mainstream white film or any other type of disposable film. "Coonskin" wants to be more. Aims to aim and fry much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't just entertain the genre. Nor has he only charged blacks, but in reality he seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story about some prisoners waiting for a prison. The fact that it is even possible to get out of a prison in the world of "Coonskin" makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black Harlem brothers called Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who wants respect and a piece of the action and they are willing to get it by any means necessary. The Italian mob is doing all the real action. <br /> <br /> Star of musicians of great name: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to bring home the Pulitzer. Obviously something big is happening here. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a descent into this world, this side of racial division. From an angry black, hip, deep, full of soul with a hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublime". This seems to have never even heard of the word. But perhaps an argument like this needs extremism. True satire like a bat. Some topics cannot be dealt with delicately. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is merciless in the goddess. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene appears unscathed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real" all according to mood and situation. Animated and human characters all share the same reality and are meant to be taken literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never shows ugly caricatures just for its shock value. He always has something to say. Nor is the black face free. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he seems to be using it to really try to say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi's films, this incorporates animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just a gimmick here. All this technique is all intertwined, they merge while something is said. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this inevitably feels dated. Many of these types of films (including those by Bakshi) are very current, very inspiring. They reflect the certain tendency for the day, but looking back on them years later, there is only an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truths). <br /> <br /> Even if the music, clothes, jargon and the city clearly looks like a photo that belongs to a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same, whatever their ear . Anyone who has seen the movies, the state of things and been in the company of people knows what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Also some of the black characters are a rabbit (junglebunny), a big bear and a fox. One of the most rancid and disgusting racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who is on the trail of these "dirty n ----" s after the death of a policeman. But for him, it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers wearing the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure to hurt blacks. <br /> <br /> The sequence involving the Godfather and his woman is one of the most moving pieces of the entire film, of which there are many. Performs as an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> The promotional line: ATTENTION: "This film offends everyone!" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have been advised ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
