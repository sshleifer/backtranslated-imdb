I watched this movie early in the morning when I was supposed to sleep. This, in itself, was the testimony that Deliverance was a spell movie. I think Boorman did a great job directing this film. With how much skill the first scene with the people of the hills and the banjo of the duels was made. He showed so well and quickly how the people of the area were intrinsically reserved and simple. Case in point - near the end of the "duel", the boy who played the banjo was smiling (he loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the boy was too reserved to answer . The river trip has never left you bored, for sure. The rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show exactly what the group was facing in this wooded area of ​​Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock was well done. Some said they were not influenced by the ordeal. I disagree - if you really paid attention, he did not respond during the entire action immediately following, in which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and chased the toothless boy away. He was confused when Ed killed the other boy later on the cliff top. It almost seemed that the arrow had been fired while Ed was curled up and expected to die, but then you realize that the arrow he had fired earlier had finally taken effect. <br /> <br /> However, a great movie, and I was swinging between 8 and 9 to my vote, but after reading a message from an unhappy voter who gave him a "1", I gave him a "10". The reasoning of this individual seemed to be based on personal prejudices rather than an objective point of view, and his vote was obviously an unrelated attempt to lower the rating.
