The return to the lost world was shot together with the 1992 version of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five people, led by Challenger, return to the plateau where a group has begun drilling for oil that is threatening to destroy the earth. Gomez has something to do with this. They manage to defeat the perforators and the plateau is saved, to the delight of the natives. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, the few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner resume their Challenger and Summerlee roles and three of the other actors are back as well. <br /> <br /> Despite having read several negative reviews of this and those cheap-looking rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed going back to the lost world. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
