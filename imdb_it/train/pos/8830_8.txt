This is a masterpiece film in B / W 35mm film. The movie shows you a strange way to start the day at 7:35 am in a bar and how many things can happen in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The short incredibly, takes you into a complex story using very few elements, and step by step makes you understand that something is not completely right. It expresses a lot, makes your adrenaline high with subtle details and is incredibly understandable by anyone, not just film critics. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: short European, black and white and low budget. Don't let it scare you. It is really worth seeing by anyone, not just experts of the genre. <br /> <br /> It's not much else to say, since the film only lasts 8 minutes (exactly), and I don't want to mess it up. But I saw it online and I couldn't understand why nobody spent a few minutes posting a comment about it. <br /> <br /> It is really worth watching. 10/10.
