Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives by his past glories, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low-key performance like Jack Dundee. He dropped the Big Pass in more than one way. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into a movie, like Jack hisses at a mouse, Reno poses, and the call of the caribou goes off. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be played (known to the NFL).
