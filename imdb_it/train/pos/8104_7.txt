This is a fantastic 1936 film. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern spectator), the elegant vision of the year 2036 that comes later, compensates. However, don't plan to be able to understand all the dialogue - sound quality and accents (it's American - but "1930" American) make it difficult. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is an overwhelming experience for a hundred years in an imaginary American city called "Everytown". It stretches from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, to 2036, when technology comes forward and creates its problems. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit slow - although it is difficult to say what audience would have thought then. Events, suspense and graphics are rather lacking in today's terms. However, when it comes to the future, it's simply fun to watch. The large sets and the retro science fiction look of everything is hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have great listening skills, this movie is hard to hear. I think I only understood 80% of the dialogue. Could use subtitles. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan, this is one of the classics of the genre and is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until a version of subtitles is available and watch it if you're comfortable with movies from this period.
