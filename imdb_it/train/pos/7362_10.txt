What a movie full of fun and sexy! They certainly don't make them that way anymore. 4 sexy au pairs come to London and have all sorts of sexual mishaps. The tone is strangely innocent, since the remarkable nakedness evolves in farcical situations, rather than any explicit sexual desire on the part of the characters. It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film certainly reveals the origins of the softcore film as the nudie cuties and the old-school naturism films. My special interest in "Au Pair Girls" is that I'm a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress has ever looked better (she is skinny but wonderfully shapely), or dressed, come to that (I loved her from the original UFO tour - who else could take away a purple wig!), I'll eat my hat.
