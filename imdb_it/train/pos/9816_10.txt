Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good at the film and it was perfect for the part! It is hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I saw this I thought why they have to do all these things. It's not fair, but they learned their lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anyway if you see this movie on TV watch it because it's beautiful!
