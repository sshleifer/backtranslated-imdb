Gunga Din (1939) is based on the poetry of Rudyard Kipling. The film is directed by George Stevens. It is set in India in the 19th century, where three British soldiers must stop an evil guru and his murderous cult. Gunga Din is a wonderful comedy adventure war with lots of exciting moments. The three main men are brilliant. Cary Grant is Sergeant. Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sergeant MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the son of the legendary you know) is Sergeant Tommy Ballantine. Let's not forget the other good players who include Sam Jaffe who plays Gunga Din brilliantly. The beautiful and talented Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It is incredibly fun to watch the difficulties of Tommy and Emmy's wedding plans. very funny. It can be fun, it can be electrifying. It can be anything that requires a good movie.
