Pleasant story of the Pimlico community in London that, after the explosion of an unexploded bomb of World War II, finds a royal map that states that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This film works because it appeals to the imagination that many of us have in creating our own rules and not having to listen to THEM. A solid cast of British supporters, particularly Stanley Holloway, makes this more credible. <br /> <br /> There are some very good moments in the film, such as when people have run out of stock and other Londoners on the other side of the fence start throwing food and other things at them. <br /> <br /> Even if you always knew that Pimlico would return to being part of the United Kingdom, the people of PImlico and therefore the viewer does not care when that happens, it leaves a nice feeling of happiness. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to think that these low-cost movies from a small London studio are still so popular over fifty years later. The producers must have something right.
