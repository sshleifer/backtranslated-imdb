I'm really outraged by the comment I read stating that this film was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was ruined by the black and white film. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely amazing for the moment! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people had to go through is absolutely remarkable. It took a week just to cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their shoulders, climbing a solid slab of rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I'd like to see Someone do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with some really amazing shots and an incredible story.
