A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So it is, perhaps, not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera works, recites, directs and everything else is unique, original, superb in every way - and very different from the garbage that unfortunately we are used to get. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this film, his acting is unique - it's completely his - neither "British" nor "American" nor anything else I've ever seen. There is something fascinating about this. <br /> <br /> Long, uninterrupted and natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few limited ways of shooting and editing.
