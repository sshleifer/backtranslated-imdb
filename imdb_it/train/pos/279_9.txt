I love the way this game can literally make you jump out of your seat while you're playing it. The way the screen jumps and flashes when you're hit, it's very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that it's just a game and your not right there. The sound effects and the sound are fantastic. There are lots of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or less. Get this stone that can repel enemies while you recover mana to destroy your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that for as long as you're playing, you're really nervous and afraid of what might be hiding around the corner or what might jump behind you. If you want to have the full experience, try playing with mobile phones on.
