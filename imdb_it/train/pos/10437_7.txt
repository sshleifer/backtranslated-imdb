This is a slow story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprise. If you can't bear to see a movie about two people talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly to the end and about a romantic love story, don't waste time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you like dialogue, masterful narration, ideas that stimulate thought and find true love in the fabric of life, then this is your film. I advise you to watch this film when you are more careful, because the rhythm, the music and the general tone of the film can put you in a woolly mood. It's really great. I really mean. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are boring at times with their mannerisms but, fortunately, the harmony between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They behave and feel from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In their conversations there are excellent comments on many topics that will stimulate thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too varied for such young people, but I could underestimate their intelligence. It still hasn't ruined the film. <br /> <br /> The general story is very simple and I think it gives the film its charm and in the end it is power. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The flow of the film is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. The story develops in a gentle, systematic and substantial way. The build up to the end is satisfying and ultimately rewarding.
