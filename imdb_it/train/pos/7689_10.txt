This was what black society was before the epidemics, the gangsta rap and AIDS that plagued the ghettos in the 1980s. Decent and hard-working families who struggled to survive and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and high on the civil rights movements of the sixties, the times were hard but for which it was worth fighting. Keeping their heads above water, making a wave when you can, this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families, before they started to predict each other and everyone else to survive to the horrors of the ghettos. It is heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos were like and what they have become now.
