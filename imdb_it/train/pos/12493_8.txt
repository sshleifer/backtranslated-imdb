After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indies) have baked, we finally get a movie that offers some moments of fear. There are a few clich√© moments, but I'm not sure it is possible today to make an entirely original film. There isn't much here again ... it was done well. <br /> <br /> Make sure you pay attention, as the "thin" scares arrive quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very well written false track in this film and, unfortunately, a very little cast role. Cheri Christian does not make an effective Julie (his wife / mother). First of all, it's totally unpleasant. I know, I know ... he just had a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows her as "normally" and the relationship between her and her husband is rather annoying (unintentionally). I think the director wanted us to have some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumbs up for the finale, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily have been resized with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is a good old fashioned scary movie ... something that is nowadays quite rare.
