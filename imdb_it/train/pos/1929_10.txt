Recently I had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim at the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that it is the best film I have ever seen throughout the year and the only film in which I have ever felt inspired to write a comment / review. This film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogues, excellent acting and an inspirational message. Ordinary lives come together in a swimming lesson for adults and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. This is acutely illustrated by the first minute images of this captivating film in which we see only the legs and torso of individuals of various shapes and sizes entering a pool of water. This film is brilliantly directed when the actors are positioned and positioned in captivating scenes, which attract your attention and your imagination.
