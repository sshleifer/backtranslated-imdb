This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He has great acting of Hanks, Newman and all the others. Definitely the best interpretation of Jude Law. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is just as good and includes an original soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood of the film. Production design is also a factor in what makes this film special. For me, it takes a lot to beat Padrino, but the fantastic cinematography shown wins this contest. Definitely a best film nominated in my book.
