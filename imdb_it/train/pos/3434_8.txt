If the Australian post office has ever needed a promotional film for recruitment, that's it. This is one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can watch it again and again. Miranda's performance is moving because it shows an aspect of Australia unimaginable for many Europeans, as it can be cold, wet and gloomy, just like anywhere else and just like elsewhere, what's important is the people around you. The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and transform the perspective of a career into a "dead letter office", a thought to consider. Miranda has continued to make bigger films, but I hope she always keeps a thought in it for this?
