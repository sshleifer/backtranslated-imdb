It is a pleasure to see this creativity on TV again. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters relate well and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve when they take their legs). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> The girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is as adorable as Olive is. The two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope they write them in larger parts since they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, this is all the news for the press. Go get yourself a big bowl of popcorn and have fun with something old-fashioned. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
