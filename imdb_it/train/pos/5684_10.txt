Wonderland is the fascinating film that tells of the participation of the x-rated movie star John C. Holmes in the brutal murders of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the film deceives us into thinking that this is a romantic portrait of the porn industry in the wake of Boogie Nights and this is not the case. In fact, with the exception of some references made by the newscasts that John Holmes is a porn star and a short montage of John Holmes' real life movie, this film is strictly dramatic about the involvement of a celebrity fallen with murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite being misleading, the film is truly engaging. The acting of the whole cast is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is incredible in his ability to go down all the ways of John Holmes. I was completely convinced that I was looking at what John C. Holmes probably looked and acted like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or Hollywood stories then I think you will like to look at Wonderland.
