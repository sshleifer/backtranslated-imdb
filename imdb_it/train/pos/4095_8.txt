Now my friends, films like "La BÃªte" (aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be made in the old continent :), in this film we see everything: dirty horses, nymphomaniacs outside gorillas, no sensible dialogues etc. etc. etc ... In serious terms now, it is an allegory, that men could sometimes be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's a surprising, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of the shocking European exploit, I recommend this movie. If you like this, I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
