First of all, this is an excellent series, even if we have some sort of James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, the first adventure of 007 is chronologically, Dr. No (1962) is the second, while at Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is reported as the new substitute for male "M", so how could he be in his place at the beginning, before Bond became a double-0, apart from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? This is more or less a thrilling "poetic" license. We have to put our heads aside for a while if we want to be entertained. No, the new Star Trek movie has no primitive electronics of the original series from almost half a century ago. In the 1960s the communicators were fantastic. (now we call them mobiles) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think that in 400 years, they would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So please let the producers have room for maneuver. <br /> <br /> But to try to make things a little coherent, let's reflect on the creation of Cylons only 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where do all the Cylons who populated the original land come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous leaps in space. Well, what happened if one of the Cyclon ships at war with Caprica's fleet was fired or there was a sunspot or anything else and a ship loaded with human-looking Cylons ended up not just jumping into the space, but over time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a ship crippled near Earth One. They colonized it, discovered that they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they sent a "ragtag" fleet to look for the legendary Caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become humans, which he eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Obviously. Which came first, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It's chilly fun!
