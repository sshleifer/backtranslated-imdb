I really enjoyed this movie. He managed to do something that few films do now; he provided family values ​​while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a model for girls to watch. The girls with whom I really enjoyed the film and kept talking about Nancy as we were leaving the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I don't think parents will get bored at the theater. No, he will not win an Oscar and he did not stage magnificent special effects or even provided a horrible ghostly mystery, but he entertained me and remained faithful to the spirit of the books. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a girlfriend (she'll love it!) Or any book fan. You will not be disappointed.
