The last time I saw the movie I was about seven years old, so my opinions could be worn out over time. At the time I liked the footage that went through cartoons and live action. At the time I felt sad for the blue camel and for its sad life. I also felt happy when, after Captain Contagious kidnapped the heroine (a princess or a shepherdess toy) the tables that had been turned to him. Unfortunately the producers have never decided to transfer this film to VHS, so all I have is memories of twenty years. I am sure that if I saw the film again I would consider it trivial and mushy, but I really liked the film at the time.
