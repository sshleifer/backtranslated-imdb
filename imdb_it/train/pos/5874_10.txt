this move was hilarious hilarious !!! The funniest I've seen in a while, akshay and john kicking ass like always, and even the pullets are hot. the story is fantastic, there are lots of jokes and anyone who has reviewed this before me is an idiot. I say to him that you are not of Indian origin, so you would not understand humor. don't evaluate the films you don't understand. what did you look at, the version of the subtitles in which most jokes get lost in the translation? this is what I thought. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor ever and once again demonstrates his versatility, he can do not only the action but also the comedy, and it is excellent. John proved himself too, this is his first role in the comedy and he too was excellent.
