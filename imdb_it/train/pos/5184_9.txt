Deeply humorous but honest comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to spend a week in Tomawka, a camp in (Ontario) Canada from their former consuelor (Alan Arkin). The writer / director Mike Binder has drawn on his experience in the same field as the main source of creation of a delicate and comprehensive yarn that makes sense. Moreover, the film has many funny moments, some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite, the one that involves the use of duct tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") gives the film some impressive shots of Canadian nature. Among the protagonists, Sam Raimi, director of "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as Arkin's right hand man. Another thing, this film reassured me that a field should not be a place of bloody murders.
