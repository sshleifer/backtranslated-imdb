Since I saw this film as a child over 30 years ago, I never tire of watching it. From the opening scenes in the horn factory, to the car engine coming down from the back seat of the car, to Ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out of the window by Stan, I think this was perhaps their best film of last days. Later they moved to 20th Century Fox, and while those films weren't terrible, the comedic timing of this film was missing. Jimmy Finnlayson, their foil for a long time, in his last appearance with the boys, showing how the Doctor is super! quote: "I said goat milk" his reply to Stan asking him how to milk a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin introduce themselves! I would say all in all one of my favorite L & H comedies.
