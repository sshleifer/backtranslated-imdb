Look, this is probably one of the best films that America has to offer to the rest of the world. Hating this film means hating freedom itself. I remember that the early 1980s were a period of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. From that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in this film showed that he would never again be a type as a one-dimensional victim in the wild. His triumph is a source of inspiration for everyone. The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws clear comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!
