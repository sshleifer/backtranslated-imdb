When it comes to movies, I can be pretty picky and complain about anything and everything that's wrong. While each film has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was difficult, since half of it was written in capital letters and did not contain real information about the film), it may have been led to believe that this film was not too much well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you discovered the reason for disdaining the poster: he doesn't like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production group smokes crack ... apparently). br /> <br /> So, although I have never written a review before, I thought this film deserved one based on its merits, not its director's sexual orientation. Let's first examine a short checklist: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I won't give it a shred, but the plot is very compelling and certainly not what one would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and should be approached as such. The story will really amaze you, even more because it's true (and the plot has remained true to real events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful acting? Oh yes. Robin Williams freed himself a long time ago from comedian cast chains, and has since grown into serious roles that many people would have written about just ten years ago. Once again he reaches a high level in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly restless and entangled in a cause of ... well, I'll let you see for myself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent management? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I was referring to, I actually know something about the direction. I'm studying the art of directing at school now for 3 years. Of course I don't think it makes a small difference (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction), but I thought I should simply establish once again that I'm basing my opinions here on something substantial and relevant ... for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> The direction of Patrick Stettner was moody and dark, and allowed angles and lighting to help create those much sought after "tension and release" feelings rather than the messy and fast work of the camera and the rapid cuts we are so often subjected to today. Some people can really show you a story through their camera, while others feel like they have to make history with the camera. I really appreciate the fact that someone these days has the courage to use the camera as it should be used, which is like an eyeball through which we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. I've already written so much, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I'll just finish. <br /> <br /> In short, go see this movie. Don't listen to people who have secondary reasons for throwing it away, especially if they're stupid enough to unknowingly reveal that motive to 1/4 of their post. Enjoy the show! -Well
