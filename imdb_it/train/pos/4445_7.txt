This first Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a minor film, but shows the German director's inspiration in improving tiring lines in something like art. Set in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned abandoning her husband and provincial family for the charm of the Chicago stage. She has never fulfilled her ambitions and is attracted to the city that she left with an impatient letter from her daughter who informed her that she too took a taste for the theater (a high school production, that is). Back in her old town, once again she clashes with pettiness and has to do with her hostile first-born daughter, the disoriented (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and the ex-lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk stands out by creating meaningful compositions, with each shot framed carefully, and he is helped immeasurably by having made Stanwyck his protagonist. It works with a crisp 76 minutes, and that's okay, because the material doesn't really have the legs to go over.
