I saw it as a child at the end of the eighties and I must say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that remain etched in your imagination for a long time. If you have never understood the charm of souls, discovering this film could be your golden ticket to the city of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Cellular animation, although somewhat traditional, has a vivid style that explosively describes Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is one of those unique children's movies like Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz that completely transcends the status of 'family entertainment' and stands as a cinema classic in its own way . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
