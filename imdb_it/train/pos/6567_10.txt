Most people (36) gave this film a 10, and those who don't are too critical or perhaps expect something else. This is one of my favorite movies of the 80s, it grows on you and has everything. I've just seen it on DVD and 20 years later it still doesn't disappoint, having a lot of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that great car chases, automatic weapon shootings and lots of exploding things and you'll have fun with the edge of your driving experience! You will cradle or whistle the main song for days after seeing this. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you'll love it. The premise is that of a pocket book hero, like Wild Doc, really existing and helping people fight evil so they can write the story is almost true for life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and screenwriter of many films. In this film Jake Speed ​​(the character) is an adventurer type of Indiana Jones, he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations, but sometimes he uses brute firepower (yes, and pure luck too! ). Keep an eye on his unique hi-tech "James Bond" equipment, the ultimate road warrior SUV that falls from the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is the beautiful young love interest of the first vampire Jim Carey film "Once Bitten" and here she is a little bigger and still knockout than her teenage blond sister. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are "real bad" men and they are the worst evil scum of short stature I love to hate. The ending is simply perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately never made - but you can only imagine what would happen next! <br /> <br /> You must see this film only because it will entertain and amuse you and it is worth the price of a ticket.
