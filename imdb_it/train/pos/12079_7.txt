For those who think of Dame May Witty as the very kind, slightly mad, old lady of The Lady Vanishes by Hitchcock, this film requires an adjustment. Here, she is anything but kind or crazy. Instead, his son, George Macready is the madman. Just don't give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and no cushion of furniture in the house is safe. Now we know what she has in mind for Nina Foch trapped if she manages to get out from under her mother's overbearing hand. <br /> <br /> Really a little woman-in-danger movie that keeps the suspense high. The script never strays from Foch's dilemma. She is held prisoner in a large old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. They will kill her, but why. His situation makes no sense. Tension rises as she seeks one escape stratagem after another, but even strangers seem against her. We begin to feel his powerlessness and growing paranoia as the world moves away from her. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis has taken a big step towards the state of worship with this film and understandably. Also, watch Foch run thinly through a range of emotions without once going to the top. Even Witty shines like a truly intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can keep her wacko son in line. My only reservation is the climax that seems too elaborate considering the timing of the events. Nevertheless, it is a good, unnerving way to spend a little over an hour, courtesy of Columbia studies.
