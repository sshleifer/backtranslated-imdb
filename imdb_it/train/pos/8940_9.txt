The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most heartbreaking books I have ever read. It tells the surprising stories of two sisters, both of whom gained devotion and respect by working in their 70s as a teacher and dentist, then they lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance of the rebellious "rebel" Bessie, the dentist. He not only expresses his anger, his anguish and his wisdom; she lets you know exactly where they come from using a word economy. Diahnn Carroll has the feeling of an older sister, the teacher, perfectly down, but I'm afraid she never lets me believe she's over 100 years old. It doesn't matter - the stories deserve to be told. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in unruly and insecure acting in the first part of the film as the New York Times journalist. This is also just a small distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction and even if two or three are slightly damaged in the translation, most of them do well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as an essential reading to all the people I recommend any book a. I can't do without this TV movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be very useful.
