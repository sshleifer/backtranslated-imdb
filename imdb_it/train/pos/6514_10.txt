I thought the show kids did a great job. I particularly liked the performance of Emma's character. Very well! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to watch my watch every 5 minutes. I liked the scenes with the tooth fairy and her burn. Even the ghostly appearances of the souls of the children who were released were good. Another positive aspect of the film is that it has continued to move. There were not many slow scenes. Even adult leads were believable and therefore helped keep the show entertaining. All in all a pleasant night of watching the film.
