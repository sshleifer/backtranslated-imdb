Since the title is in English and in the IMDb list the main language of this show as English, I will focus on the revision of the English version of Gundam Wing (2000), as presented in the DVD set published by Bandai. My actual review for the entire series is under the voice of IMDb "" Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W (1995). <br /> <br /> Very little has changed compared to the plot, script and characterization of his English adaptation and it really depends on your taste to choose which language to watch this show in. Purists can stick everything they want to Japanese, but for a more "realistic" experience I recommend the English track since all the characters, except by Heero Yuy, they are not Japanese (most of them are actually Caucasians with a couple of non-Japanese Asians.) First, the characters' personalities meet more "directly" than in the Japanese version. The contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some-or-take shows but a group of very well expressed actors. <br /> <br /> The Wing Gundam pilot Heero Yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but learns lentamen you the value of his humanity. the impassive delivery can be criticized as a "bad deed" but it matches very well with Heero's personality. <br /> <br /> Deathscythe The Maxwell Duo of Gundam, always cheerful in the face of death, receives an intensive course in cultivating the value of life and friends. He is perhaps the best actor played in the entire show, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. He may seem a little too old for his age, but Duo's English voice easily outshines his irritatingly nasal Japanese voice. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lonely and lost soul, whose only purpose so far has been combat; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not make friends. Kirby Morrow gives a dark but realistic performance like Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> The winner of Quatre Rebarba is voiced by Brad Swaile who has no problem pointing out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences the horrors of war and death firsthand. A huge advantage is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes, it is voiced by an actress in the Japanese version), but a typical 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang voiced by Ted Cole may seem a bit exaggerated, but plays in sharp contrast to the more subdued roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not be suitable for his young personification at the beginning of the series, but as his character matures later in history, his voice follows suit and ends up adapting very well to the character's development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise would be one of the most drastically changed items compared to the Japanese version. Both voices carry different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect, keeping in line with his high status and charismatic status. His English voice of Brian Drummond is more subdued, seems more subtle and "snake", emphasizing Zech's secret nature regarding his hidden orders and beliefs convinced in his ideals. <br /> <br /> The members of OZ are a mixed bag indeed. Treize Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye has a more realistic and concrete performance than his way of speaking Japanese larger than life. However, Lady Une does not convey her contrasting double personality as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin plays ......... almost always bored. Cannon fodder pilots and military leaders have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> I would have appreciated if they had had time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic origins. The voices of the Maganac Corp were generally uninspired, but could have been more interesting had they received Middle Eastern accents. Members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have performed better with a classy European accent that reflects their noble status. <br /> <br /> Despite the overwhelming acting of the secondary characters, the main cast manages to bring the show and results in a less exaggerated and more realistic overall version of the Gundam Wing script. Very faithful to the original Japanese script, keeping all the basic thought that drives ideas and themes on politics, war and human nature. Sadly, it also preserves the flaws of the original Japanese script.
