This is a really interesting movie. It's an action movie with a mixed comedy. Foxx joins the comic Epps in this film to give him a comic twist. He will continue to ask you what will happen to Foxx later. It was a well-made film, the director used the right colors in this film (dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feeling. Kimberly Elise also starred in this film and it's always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Jamie Kennedy is also in this film. It's worth seeing, you haven't seen it. It's definitely worth it if you are a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than what is actually given.
