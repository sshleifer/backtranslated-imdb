Noll's comfortable way of posting blunt comments, often with curses, to describe things he is more knowledgeable of than most is rather refreshing. There is another character in the film who constantly tries to verbalize complex problems, using more language than necessary. This guy should never have had a dictionary of synonyms. Cut to Noll and you know you're ready for a party! <br /> <br /> The way the surf wave pioneers are depicted is very evocative of a "lost era". Nevertheless, the fact that no one knows how these guys made their living, much less took care of problems like medical care. The use of old movies has been masterfully performed.
