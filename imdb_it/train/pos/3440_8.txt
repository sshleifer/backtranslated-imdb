She loves Rosario Dawson, she thinks she is one of the most beautiful actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> The descent seems to be more self-empowering than anything else. It is the coherent undertone throughout the film. Dialogue is flat, the characters apparently intentionally bland and unilateral. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario's journey from self-empowerment to the loss of empowerment and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Pitching as a classic of rape is not appropriate, and is probably why so many people don't enjoy the movie. The standard public of "rape" would not particularly like this film, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers and confronts the relevant public, whether they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film does not slap the audience through the face with paternal boldness, it involves the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> The descent is a good film that IMHO is strongly undervalued.
