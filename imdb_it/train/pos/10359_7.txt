Meryl Streep is a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she was mocked for playing many accented roles, but each time she has a particular accent. His interpretation of Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as a portrait here, was not particularly nice, nor so intelligent. But that makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think it's worth all 10 or more of his Oscar nominations. Regarding the movie, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the topic of religious bigotry among the general public has played an important role in history. I had missed most of it when I first saw the film a few years ago, but yesterday it came out loud and clear. And it seems that the Australian press is just as used to chasing misery and exaggerating like its American colleagues. A nice movie. A bit different. Degree: B
