"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film from his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And although it's not as good as "Cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy plays the role of seeker of missing children who have been assigned an unusual case. His assignment: finding the title character, a child with mystic powers. This film could have been titled "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom" as some parts of this film are like a Spielbergian adventure, rather like an Indiana Jones comedy. He has a comedy with laughter and adventures with special effects. Very funny. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
