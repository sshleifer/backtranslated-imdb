Los Angeles-based television journalist Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (the catchy brawler Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the pretty Lois Young, who is not only killed first but also fucks her tasty body in a tasty free nude bath scene) go to Solvang, California to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels have been booked, the three adorable ladies are forced to look for accommodation in an exquisite, remote but presumptuous villa owned by the madman Ernest Keller (delightfully played to perfection for the brilliant Sydney Lassick) and his tame sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a dark and deadly dark family secret that resides in his damp basement: a sparrow, pathetic, creamy, incested, son of a Mongolian man named Junior (a moving and terrifying portrait of Stephen Furst; Flounder in " Animal House ""), which naturally loosens and causes a murderous disaster. Practically directed by Danny Steinmann, with a uniform acting from a sturdy cast, an irresistibly perverted plot, an excellent trick by Craig Reardon, a pleasantly disturbing atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, a slow but steady rhythm, nice and well-designed characters and a surprisingly fiery freezer frame (the subplot of the incest contains an unexpectedly strong and touching punch), this psycho sleepy of the 80s unjustly neglected is worth a try .
