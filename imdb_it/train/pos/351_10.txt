It is a colored film with slasher. That's all. <br /> <br /> It has the mysterious element that SCREAM has made so popular in slasher movies, but I never care about these things. Understanding who the bad guy is is not that interesting considering that the clues are all misleading. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death were inventive and gorey, bringing to mind the horror films of the 1980s such as Friday 13. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it is difficult to identify the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie. So simple. I really liked it and I'm going to look at it again while I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> - MB
