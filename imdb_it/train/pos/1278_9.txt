"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically lashes the pop culture to the point of a humorous self-description. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh / sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters that I liked the most ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man between 30 and 40 years old who creates a publishing magazine led by pop culture called "The Next Big Thing "". The fact is that this magazine does not really exist, and it is just an excuse for Simon to get closer to the actors by interviewing them, just to scoff at them silly, insulting their way of buying pop culture. , she is also writing a magazine (which is true), which has mainly to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father.Darla is a genuinely amiable (or helpful) character, depending on how you see her neurotic behavior Magda is a prostitute, the character liked me the best Brent is a flat character with little for him, as is Tedra, the queen of music videos for a group of rock bands classified as B. However, these characters intertwine a very interesting network ins And this film calls into question all the reasons people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie / art house crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
