From the opening scene aboard a crowded train in which a ruthless pickpocket is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) steals from a woman's bag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SUD STREET is inexorably fascinating to watch. In part it is because the acting is uniformly strong from all the cast, the black and white photography is sharp and adds the crudeness of the story and the characters, and because the direction of Samuel Fuller places it in the same league with the biggies as John ( ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as Huston's film on a robbery that goes wrong - but the payoff is not as strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard-line girl Widmark describes as "banged a lot". He gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to his role as the not-too-bright woman who brings a micro-film to her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows. I'm in his wake when the theft occurs. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to his portrait of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life. He is particularly touching in his final scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This is guaranteed to keep your attention through its hour and twenty minutes of running time. Good Fox noir and notable for Widmark, Peters and Ritter performances.
