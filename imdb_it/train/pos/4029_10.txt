I have no words to describe how beautiful this film is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a real description of the days of the partition. The film haunted me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila has played the role of his life in this film. He put his life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in his role as Rashid. It is difficult to imagine anyone other than these two who play the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes seemed so natural to Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri while Ramchand did a fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes you can't get out of your head. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to your eyes. The climax is just a killer. I expected a tragic ending but, fortunately, the ending was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc. Not to be missed.
