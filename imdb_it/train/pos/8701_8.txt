For all those who expect a traditional superhero film, it could be an unpleasant surprise. It's definitely more of a drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character, it somehow always goes wrong. <br /> <br /> This is because Sasha, like any superhero, takes the law in his own hands and the company does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. While on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, so things get even more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the film lacks dynamics. It reminds me slightly of the narrative in the recent films by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an action scene it becomes so immensely dynamic that it is all over before we realize what is happening. But the director doesn't want to impress us with flashy and flashy actions. What is more important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very poor, which makes it even more difficult to concentrate on the film. So in practice, you have to be very patient to watch it. <br /> <br /> Is the film worth it? This is a really difficult question to answer. I don't think this experience has enriched me so much, but somehow I keep thinking about this movie and I feel like watching it again. Mainly because of the atmosphere, which is very dense, but not stuffy because Sasha and Katya always have hope. After all they are young, who have all their lives to live. So no matter how difficult it is, there is always a slight melody when they are together.
