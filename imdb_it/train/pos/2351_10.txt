First of all, I want to make it clear that the inability of the average user to appreciate the imagination is frightening. What makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates. You don't need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute. Where is the wonder of the extravagant tales of childhood, very similar to A Wrinkle in Time. <br /> <br /> I say that it is pleasantly original because it is the opposite of the masses of secular television that leaves no room for imagination or amazement. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add a bit of escape to the TV experience. <br /> <br /> Hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show. The setting of the Fifties, the innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and the physical setting that do not want to be considered pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. While entertaining, other television programs have taken a shelf for this series. He really returned to television a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder. <br /> <br /> Pushing the daisies quickly arrived at the top of my list.
