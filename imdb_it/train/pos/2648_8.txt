Truly the story of two presumptuous brothers and their respective falls of grace (through drug addiction) and later redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is the typical intelligent, sensitive but intelligent child. The other brother is a future doctor who works hard and becomes less judicious while he himself is a victim of addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children. Not too heavy, like drug fairy tales, and all in all a rather realistic outline of the family dynamics that drug problems entail. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and to praise James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love.
