This film has it all. It is a classic representation of the events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino), is just one of thousands who has the opportunity to choose his destiny in America. This cinematic but extremely accurate representation of Miamis' drug empire is surprising. Brian DePalma does an extraordinary job directing this image, so much so that the viewer becomes involved both in the plot and in each character of the cast. With the pressures of Tony's characters that are so believable and strong, Brian DePalma defines the raw talent exhibited by Steven Bauer (Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and I still watch it on a weekly basis. In this year, the twentieth anniversary of this classic detective film, I for one am a true supporter that in another 20 years people will still refer to this film in surprising numbers. With other drama films so dramatic, this film is a shock to the system.
