The best Cheech & Chong film so far !! Of all the Cheechs and Chongs this is definitely the best so far. I think I saw them all at least twelve times, and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. Compared to others, this covers many themes and gives you many beautiful laughs. Part of the texts is still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope that one day they can make another one, because they are still great comedians. I heard they are writing a new script, so who knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft has ever seen one of them ...
