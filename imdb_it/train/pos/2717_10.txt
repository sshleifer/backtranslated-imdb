I can't remember many details about the show, but I remember how passionate I was and how determined I was not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately we didn't have a video recorder at the moment, so I never saw the series again. However I can strongly remember how I felt while watching him and how excited I was every time he came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I'm almost in love with him) and he remains one of my favorite actors a day, mainly due to his appearance in the series. I would be happy to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would do anything to see it again and revisit a distant childhood ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a site dedicated to the series or has the episodes on tape since their first airing?
