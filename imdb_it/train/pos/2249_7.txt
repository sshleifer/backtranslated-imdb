I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found out that he was a positive and largely true portrayal of the Latter-day Saint faith. I think a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be useful, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. It's an incredible story of strong and devoted people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the church, the most disturbing aspect of the film (most historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one who had "knowingly deceived" the members of the church making him believe he was called to be the successor of Joseph as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot, it creates the impression that his doubts about it are historical facts, when in reality both Brigham and most church members understood and firmly believed that he had been called to lead the group. Church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. The point is important to Mormons because an important aspect of our faith depends on it: that God really speaks to the prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. <br /> <br / > Whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately describe what Brigham himself believed.
