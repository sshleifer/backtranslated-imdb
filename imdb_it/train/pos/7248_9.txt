When I first saw the exterminators of the year 3000, I had no expectations for that movie. Although, it wasn't as bad as I thought. It is a kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the plot is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the history of zombie meat eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror films: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see that boy in Fear in the city of the living dead like John Robbins and in the apocalypse of Cannibal. as the role of Mary's brother. Very funny movie, with some boring parts.
