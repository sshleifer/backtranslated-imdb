I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I love watching Brosnan in every movie, he's always good, but this was totally different. It is a disaster and plays very well. In fact, he reminded me a few times in ones :) So yes, there's not a lot of violence, there's not a lot of action, but the dialogue is fucked, the acting is superb and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny too :) that you will leave the cinema "Wow! I have been blown away", but you will come out smiling after having enjoyed a good movie. I can't ask for more. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some idiots will put the advertisement in the wrong position and you'll be reversed, upside down, inverted (with inverted audio) advertising !! Brilliant. There is nothing better than watching an announcement by Jack Daniels where the drink comes back into the bottle from the glass with an American comment "Twin Peaks".
