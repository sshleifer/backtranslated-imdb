The Teta i la Luna describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named Tete, obsessed by the breast growing in Catalonia. I love this film because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in the films of Bigas Luna (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. Being also from Catalunya (north-east of Spain) brought me many memories. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, beautiful people, beautiful life and especially many non-intimate people.
