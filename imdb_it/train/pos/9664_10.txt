Bette Midler showcases her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am thrilled that I recorded it and am able to view it whenever I want. You have what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. His voice is more beautiful than ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was his singing "Stay With Me" from his 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the excitement in the song and end up getting goose bumps. The show will leave you wanting to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of the Bette Midler albums.
