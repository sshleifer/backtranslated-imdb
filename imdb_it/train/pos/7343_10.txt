Because this film has almost disappeared in the dark is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only best Sword and Sorcery film. The brutal violence, the beautiful drawings of the characters and the good rhythm make this one of the best fantasies in circulation. It is certainly the biggest animated film aimed at a more adult audience I've ever seen. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual hectic style. It is rather a departure for Bakshi, and in my opinion his best work. I hope this film has the recognition it deserves.
