This is a heart-warming family film. He has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that) (just think of the dog in "How the Grinch stole Christmas" ... it was bad training). Paulie's story is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborate. There is nothing else to say except that this is a GREAT FILM! <br /> <br /> My ratings: history 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, photo 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - GREAT FAMILY FILM AND VERY VALUES TO WATCH!
