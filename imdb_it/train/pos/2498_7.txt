I took it in the "Danger After Dark" box set and watched it just for my interest in playing Hyde and Gackt. I was expecting a trivial horror film that was a great gore festival and with bad dialogues. Which is exactly what it would have been had it been done in America. Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good, considering that they are not professional actors, and the director did a wonderful job with all this, setting it in the future less the flying cars and holographic posters. <br /> <br /> In a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was truly amazing. The only other film in which I saw it is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film it seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is brilliant, exuberant and hyperactive, serving as a kind of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the great tough of the island he killed without thinking. So watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised by him. <br /> <br /> But don't let the summary on the back of the box escape you, because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. The character of Hyde is a vampire is almost a background with what is really happening in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. In some places it is a truly moving image, photography is really well done. It's definitely something to take back next time you're at Blockbuster.
