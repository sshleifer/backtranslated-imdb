a film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, as only the truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Some acting is extraordinary, for example Maria Hofstätter. The director tried to describe life in the most realistic way possible, succeeding. Consistently, the sex scenes are explicit and no more false than those of a hard-core film. Even though I hardly understood a sentence, I found the movie in the original language with subtitles much more gratifying, because with dubbing half the great work of the actors is lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to duplicate by a voice actor. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
