I was waiting to see this movie for a long time. The promos gave a good idea of ​​the content and when I finally saw it, I found it was pretty well done. Most conventional romantic films end with lovers who eventually marry or start a happy life after marriage, but there is indeed a great adaptation necessary for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and life. This is all about the time when a married couple Fardeen and Esha get married through an arranged marriage and start their life with their honeymoon. The acting is really a spell, although I think Esha remained a little silent and could have used some lines for herself. The story was well done and the dialogues were more or less appropriate. The editing and direction were good too, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To sum up, I'd say it's a good drama and romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer to a clean entertainer.
