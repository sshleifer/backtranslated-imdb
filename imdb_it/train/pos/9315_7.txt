The famous lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes a case for pro bono murder, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty, but was part of an extortion ring that reached the highest refuges in the city. Driven by his own complicity, he embarks on an investigation, stumbles over the identity of the "stranger" who runs the union, and kills him. <br /> <br /> The ironies commit themselves when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend it by indicating the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. Although a little short of urban grit and long rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less for style or structure than for his recognition of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the post-war years.
