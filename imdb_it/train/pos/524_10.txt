I saw this movie years ago on television late at night. Then he switched to the title of "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a boy, I remember being deeply moved by the plot and amazed by the visual effects of the judicial process (those who saw it know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film is right there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised that it was not among the 250 best films until I realized that few have seen / voted this film, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this film will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I can buy it and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
