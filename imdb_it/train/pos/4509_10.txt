The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter. <br /> <br /> W. S. Van Dyke, peripatetic director of MGM, was responsible for this fascinating insight into life in the Arctic among the Inuit. His production was shot on location from April 1932 until November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shots took place in the studio). Considered a documentary at the time, we would probably call it a "docudrama" as it is scripted with an intriguing plot and plot. <br /> <br /> The film shows the daily life of the Eskimos, both in winter and in summer and in fact begins in the hottest period of the year without snow or ice in sight. The constant search for food is depicted and the spectator can observe the exciting hunts for walruses, polar bears, whales and caribou. The mother tongue is used throughout, with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen and by the Mounties met by the Eskimos. In reality, it is the arrival of the White Men, both good and bad, and the change they make in Eskimo society, which is an important element in the narrative. <br /> <br /> This pre-codified film deals in a frankly casual way with the Eskimo moral code, in particular with the practice of sharing a wife, who was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the whole film can be appreciated as a precious look at a lifestyle that was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> None of the casts receive credit on the screen, which is a pity they are some noteworthy performances. The first of all is that of Ray Wise, who plays the main role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan native of Inuit origin and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he continued acting, using the name of Ray Mala, in a sporadic film career, often in small unfinished roles. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays the second faithful Mala wife; the names of the beautiful actresses who play her other two wives are now dark. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras like a strict Northwestern police inspector. The two dignified Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dearing, both longtime film actors. The Danish author Peter Freuchen, on whose books the film was made, has a brief and vivid role as an evil sea captain with wooden legs that recklessly defatts Mala's cold wrath.
