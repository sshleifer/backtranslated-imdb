This movie is so beautiful. His retirement probably in the 40s and the character of Meg Ryan struggles to be known as 'intelligent'. Besides, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And all this has a magical feeling for him. Every time I look at it I feel happy. It's definitely a movie for girls, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love music. The violin is fantastic. but besides that I think it's a pretty story and everyone should look at it.
