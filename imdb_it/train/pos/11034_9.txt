Eric Valette is obviously a talented director, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. So Mal√©fique is a great film, made with a few dollars but also tons of imagination. Well, I'm a little exaggerated, but I'm sincere anyway. So, if you like dark, bloody movies, go see this. It's really worth it.
