REIGN OVER ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Newsome. Sometimes moving and sometimes mediocre drama about a deeply depressed man who lost his family on September 11th (Sandler in his best role as "Punch-Drunk Love") which ends up reunited with his old roommate and friend of the college ( Cheadle continue to do an awesome job with every role to date), a wealthy dentist who seems to have it all ?? family, wealth, happiness ?? but he really sees an ally in freedom with the personal life offers of his troubled friend. Written and directed by Binder (who plays Sandler as an ex-best friend and accountant) with equal humor and sincere sincerity, the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into a movie almost the molasses week to clear up a solution to the problems in progress.
