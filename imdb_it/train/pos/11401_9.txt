An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mix of Hollywood art and musicals. Made at the height of the powers of the MGM as a musical power, the film presents a memorable music of the Gershwins, which have rightly been called the 20th century equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, although it could rightly be argued that this film was just warming up for his best work on Singin 'in the Rain (1952) . The two films are actually closely connected. Apart from the Arthur Freed connection, the Broadway segment Melody in "Rain" owes its existence to the incredible American Ballet sequence of Paris in this film. This may have been the only time a dance number is mentioned particularly in the opening credits of the film. And it deserved to be, as it shows the capacities of Gene Kelly as a dancer and choreographer to the highest degree. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, who made her film debut incredibly, shows a maturity that makes you think she's made films for years. His introductory dance sequence, and later his work on Ballet, offers some surprisingly sexy moments rivaled in MGM Musical only by Cyd Charisse's work on Singin 'in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as the stoic friend of Kelly, who gets two of the best moments in the film: during the end party sequence (which I won't give to anyone who hasn't seen the film), and one of the most memorable musical numbers in the film combines its incredible piano qualities with special effects at the state of the art (for the moment). <br /> <br /> Georges Guetary is less memorable as Kelly's romantic rival, although he gets some musical highlights, and Nina Foch is Leslie Caron's romantic rival. The relationship between May and December between the character of Kelly and Nina reminded me of the same "maintained" relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> There are some elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin 'in the Rain. The ballet, although sumptuous and well produced, does not fit perfectly with the rest of the film. Without giving away the plot, the ballet simply happens, without a real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway sequence Melody, it really has nothing to do with the plot - and in the best musicals, the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, it's the end of the film, which takes place immediately after the ballet. Although the ending shouldn't be a surprise (this is a MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for another bit of ... movie after the end of the ballet. It is as if the director Vincente Minnelli felt he could not follow the ballet with anything else. The film literally left me speechless. <br /> <br /> Apart from this negative, An American in Paris rightly places itself alongside the best Hollywood musicals. He doesn't quite reach the heights of Singin 'in the Rain, but he gets closer and remains a testament to Gene Kelly's abilities as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
