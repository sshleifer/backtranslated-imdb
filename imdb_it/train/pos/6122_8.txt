this movie is absolutely fun. after all, the plot revolves around a serial killer who somehow turns into a snowman through a B-movie chemical accident. then he heads for the city and begins to terrorize the locals. it's up to the local police chief and other characters to try to stop him. it's done on a small budget and certainly proves it, but the great thing about this movie is that it knows it's junk. the improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene that imitate the giant snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - it is one of the few films that has its budget as its main strength. alongside the comic aspect there are other amusing moments of the comedy - listen from the beginning for the voice of a father who scares his sons to death, and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film. fantastic gaudy fun
