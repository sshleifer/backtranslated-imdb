Well, this was one of those movies that I caught in the air, and it was good enough for me to record when it appeared next time ... If, like me, you like a lot of branch horror movies from the 80s a little from the norm (ie not just another excess of generic sequels), then I think you might like it. When in the end the villain appears in person, it was absolutely not what I expected to see! All in all, I wouldn't do anything for it, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, I guess. I would give 6.5 out of 10.
