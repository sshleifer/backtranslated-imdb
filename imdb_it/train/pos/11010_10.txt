When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, many films were expected to use it as a source of inspiration. This didn't really happen, surprisingly, and it took until 2002 to bring up a movie with a similar theme. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be to his disrepute. <br /> <br /> The story is by Morgan Sullivan, who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a rival company, while under a false identity. His family life is perfectly normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he is actually doing. However, things start taking conspiracy turns and before he knows what's going on, he starts wondering who he really is. This is not helped by a strange woman who introduces herself ... <br /> <br /> The turns and turns keep you absolutely fascinated, and at no time anything ever seems forced or unbelievable. <br /> <br /> It's a compelling journey through a not too distant future, and with good acting it will keep you at the edge of your place. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
