Stack should have received the Oscar for this performance, period. It's a crime he didn't do. Incredible how humanizes a rich and worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone got a well-deserved Oscar for her performance. In fact, all the acting in this film is excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot starts with a taxi ride, then a plane, so keep moving on an emotional ride that will keep your interest everywhere. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is just an obvious soap opera. One-dimensional absorption at 100 percent. You could call it the last tool, because acting triumphs so deeply over the material. Excellently played, well directed, but strictly in its genre of soap. I wouldn't even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). While not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director with more substantial arguments might have achieved.
