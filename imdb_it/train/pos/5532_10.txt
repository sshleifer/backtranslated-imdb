Maybe I'm biased towards foxes, fox stories and all but I thought it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I really liked that it was shown when Lily wasn't comfortable, like the fire and the room (trying not to mess up too much here). I think it is important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading some other comments I am a bit confused, one says that in the end -spoiler- the mother and her son appear, as she did to tell her son of her story. The movie I saw did NOT have the mother or son at the end, just a portrait of a girl with a fox. Can anyone enlighten me on this? Anyway, I really liked this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow, which could be difficult for high-energy kids. It is still worth it if they can stand still.
