The 30s. Elegant and classy Adele (played beautifully by Debbie Reynolds with dignified determination) and Helen (the magnificent Shelley Winters who walks around with her usual histrionic panache) are the mothers of two murderers. They leave their dull past in the Midwest behind and move to Hollywood to start their dance school for aspiring young girls. Adele starts dating the millionaire Lincoln Palmer (always beautiful Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, the religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness. <br /> <br /> Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington, works from a script written by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?" was based on the screenplay of "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte", he cleverly wrote a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression and religious fervor that runs dangerously Amok The super cast has a ball with his roles colorful: Michael MacLiammoir in the role of a pompous elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a severe fire and sulfur radio evangelist, Yvette Vickers as a sly and overbearing mother of a young Bolognese star, Logan Ramsey as a snoopy investigator, and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum An elaborate talented recital has recorded with Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy's voice in the TV specials "Peanuts") as an emcee and the original victim of "Friday the 13th" Robb i Morgan who makes an impression of Mae West damn obscene and perverse highlight. The spooky soundtrack by David Raskin, a fantastic scene with Reynolds performing in an incredible tango in an elegant restaurant, the atmosphere of the Depression era, the beautiful photography of Lucien Ballard, and in particular the astonishing macabre ending are equally excellent and effective. MGM presents this fantastic gem on a double copy of DVD with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?;" both images are presented in sharp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers.
