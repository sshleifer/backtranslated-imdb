I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this movie. Spiritual writing (some jokes "inside" that I got, others not - perhaps because of actors talking over each other), great acting (in particular John Cassini), great cameos, interesting and unique direction. I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was in such a short time, he blinks and you will miss him!) But he found the film extraordinarily funny. I'll watch it again before sending it back to Netflix. I think the eager actors and actors can fully enjoy this movie. The ending is somehow expected, but I wish they had done something different (and more positive). It is a pity that the film was not received better than in the "festival" market. I recommend it to all those who love the biz actor.
