Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have always been friends and after graduating decide to travel to Thailand. Due to an accident, they meet an attractive and mysterious young foreigner who invites them to go with him to Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroin and sent to prison. Now is the time for ultimate survival and true friendship. This was a pretty good movie, I saw it a couple of times and after a while you realize that there are few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you amused. Claire Danes did a great job as usual, she's a great actress. I'd give it to Brokedown Palace 8/10
