I have to be honest and say I haven't seen many independent films, but I thought this was very well done. Direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction. The angles, settings and lights used have successfully created the nightmare world in which the main character was trapped. Many haunting and memorable images of the film remain etched in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director).
