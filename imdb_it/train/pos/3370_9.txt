Having just finished writing Cronicles of the Heroic Knight a few minutes ago, I find myself extremely happy, but the questions still hang over me. While it would seem that the first 7 episodes are actually a review of the events of the first Lodoss War Record, the truth is that in reality they are not. It would seem that the creator of CotHK had a different view on how the original ended (and this could be the reason why the first 7 episodes occur) but I can't find it. CotHK says it starts 5 years after Heros's war of which Parn was a part. I think the director made the first 5 episodes look like a summary of the original just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their actions done because they appear much less after the series has entered the Spark story. Now, once the series has taken kick in the part of Spark, we find ourselves relieved for another 10 years (15 years after the Eros War). Spark and his crew, in some cases, resemble Parn and his crew once the journey gets under way, especially the love story between Spark and Neese. I also thought of CotHK several times to launch into the original series and if it wasn't for Spark's long blue hair I know I would have stopped more than once to make sure it was the right record. By no means Considering these great setbacks, however, the authors have done a great job in creating believable characters and a remarkable storyline. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... how ??? Don't misunderstand me both are great villains even though the only malevolent feature of the Ashram is that it supports Marble. Maybe I missed something during the first part of the series that explained that part. As for the sequels, I highly recommend CotHK. I place both the CotHK and, even more, the original Record of Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than any I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
