When I saw this film for the first time, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was fun and exciting. A few years ago I saw another film, titled: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * In this film there were parts of * Lost Magicians * used. They called this film "KOR the conqueror". I started looking for the "KOR" -Movie many years, because I wanted to see the complete movie, not just the parts that were used in the * Andy Colby * -Movie. No store had rented the Kor-Movie and no store knew this movie. Many years I saw my old VHS tapes that I had at home, and how wonderful ... I have had this film for many years at home, but the film had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had a lot more time watching * KOR the Conquerer again. The music is excellent during the film, but the best part of the shooting in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunk through the green forest. The music in the background had a kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the film. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
