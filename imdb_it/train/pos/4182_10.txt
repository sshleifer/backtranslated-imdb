I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and I never forgot it. The film shows the horror of war in a way in which Hollywood usually flies over. The relationship between the soldiers of the two countries at war is highlighted by the differences in culture and by the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are not really all different inside. If you can find any kind of copy of this - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just amazed.
