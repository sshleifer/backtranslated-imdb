I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, at the beginning when that woman (Sarah) was full of terror as she slipped, I thought it was a terrifying scene as I thought when you see what you see, your nerves in your body come to you because it makes you become full of fear and your heart beats faster. I loved watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known for playing Rambo and Rocky.
