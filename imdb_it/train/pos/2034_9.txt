I've never been great in IMAX movies. They're fantastic, but once you get past the "Whoa, it seems to fly!" the films themselves are usually rather mundane and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exceptions were the powerful "Everest", the hilarious "Wild California" and now "The Human Body" of the BBC, a super-sized look inside our body. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. This 50 minute movie could be 10 hours long, and it still wouldn't reach all the systems that work in tandem as I write this review and listen to my radio, and many of us take everything for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a beating heart (it looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs of the eardrum that process the sound, the development of a child at the inside of a mother's womb and, surprisingly, some of the ... um, less attractive features I thought they would have avoided (pimples, churning of acids in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has a style rather funky, which sets it apart from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've seen all the spermatozoa find their way to the egg, but have you ever seen it on the rhythm of "Let's Get It On" by Marvin Gaye? They are creative moments like the one that makes "The Human Body" not only a health lesson, but also a fun one.
