I went to this film during a cast and crew show, because my friend, who is a producer of the film, invited me. Forget what you saw in the ads, forget what you heard, go see this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised by this. In a world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, here comes a movie that deserves your hard money! Glorious scenes, wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast that you want to eat with your heart. I discovered that this is one of the most powerful and orchestrated films of this year and with reason. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar nod. If you could give an Oscar to all interested parties as a package, this would be the movie.
