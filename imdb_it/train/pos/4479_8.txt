Ever since I saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945 for the first time, seeing it on videotape gives me great nostalgia. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to get involved in the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps more interested in thinking about the future careers of the protagonists. Although Sinatra had made a couple of negligible films immediately after his appearance after his days as Dorsey, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another spectator has noticed, this seems to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it is easy to understand why he was a caricature like a bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academic award for acting, and he would play in many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dances dominated this film, his victorious performance did not suggest that he would become a great creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a dance style complementary to that by Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play an "electrifying" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder of the 1920s. An additional note: a reviewer praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. He later starred alongside her in "On the Town", but Pamela Britton starred in this film.
