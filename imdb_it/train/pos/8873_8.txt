This film came and went in theaters. Because of its nature, it is possible to understand why it was not well received. He was unjustly struck down by his subject more than the actual film. Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was a good film that tried to talk about a theme feared in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / History: Higher Learning is mostly focused on Malik (played by Omar Epps), an innate movie star who faces not being fast enough and a strict professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). Become a friend of Fudge (Ice Cube) and a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later they end up dealing with some skinheads on campus. Remy (played by Michael Rapaport) is a confused little boy who ends up making friends with some local skinheads on campus. Once they set their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Higher learning is not without flaws: character development is poor, Omar Epps perfect performances, Tyra Banks and skinheads leader (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes does not adapt to this film at all. Also, women who turn into gays after being abused by men have been clich√©s before this movie, so you know I didn't like that part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Apart from that, this film was not badly hurt. Laurence Fishburne was as good as Professor Phipps (although I could do without the accent), Fudge was Ice Cube's best performance and Michael Rapaport was as good as the confused Remy. All in all it was one of John Singleton's best films and is one of the reasons I disapprove of the garbage he published. The cinema needs more films like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and fewer films like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very useless remake of Shaft.
