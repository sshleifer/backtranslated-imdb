The first von Trier film I have ever seen was breaking the waves. Certainly a good film but it certainly lies in the shadow of Europe. Europa tells the story of a young German-American who wants to get to know Germany immediately after the Second World War. He takes a job his uncle arranged for him as a pursuer on a luxury train. Because of his work, he crosses a nearly totally destroyed Germany, meets the killing of traitors and hunts down former Nazi party members. Society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conscience by focusing on the job he also has as a tracker on the train. Coincidentally, the main character involved in the bombing and terrorism by a group called "werewolves" pressured him to help them place bombs on trains. The atmosphere is stunning. The spectator is taken on stage by a man who tries to put the observer under hypnosis and then counts on waking up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
