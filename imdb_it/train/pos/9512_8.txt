This is a movie that can make you want to see it again. In particular, I liked the way it ended. I didn't see the end coming, but when Laws was not wiped out the first time, it is suspected that he will come back again. <br /> <br /> The plot is compelling and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story was necessary to capture the viewer and action was necessary for that. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that Michael Jr. could be as apparently indifferent as the younger brother and mother who were left speechless. But I can appreciate that the theater scene could not really attract our attention because it had a bigger story to tell. Some complained about Hanks as a gangster. I don't think it's justified. If his character had been more difficult, he wouldn't have cared if his son had pulled a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
