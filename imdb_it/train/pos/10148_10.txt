I would have given this film some stars, simply because it was a "Lifetime" presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether they "settle" there, in the rural areas of Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, Los Angeles etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian venue. <br /> <br /> But if there were ever one that deserves the highest rating - 10 * on this site, it's this movie. Certainly not for originality, because this story has been made many times, in many variations, with many very similar to this specification. It was also done quite often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, by Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, and others - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many others. I can think of at least 10-12 more, equally prominent, presently present, on top of my head, which could be added now, and there are probably many others that could be brought to mind. <br /> <br /> Not for drone, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of its kind I've seen. I took it by chance on a Friday noon, at a time when I only had TV because I was taking a couple of hours after a particularly hectic week. I would never have met this film in the 8 years since it was made. And, while the two conductors did enough to be known for the most part, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother) whom I had seen in some of her youth, and Michael Rispoli (Charlie's best friend Henry) who was exceptional as "Gramma", the threatening loan of juice , tough, street boy from "Rounders". <br /> <br /> The chance encounter and the encounter between the best friends of both protagonists, like a story of love sub-history, with the correlation of their being such with Anna and Charlie who reveal themselves only later, it is often the plot weaving within the genre, but here it makes no difference to the fun (in fact it improves it). <br /> <br /> By checking some other comments, I completely agree with those that are the most positive. The main word that describes this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the artists; characters; the chemistry between and between all the characters, in any combination presented, and all secondary and even secondary roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with a "tougher edge:" "Rounders"; the escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone; "Goodfellows;" also the classics like "Casablanca", "Gone with the wind", "Citizen Kane". But for pure fun, not complicated, this was exceptional. With a fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle". And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the co-stars and support staff here were equivalent to those of these mega-films.
