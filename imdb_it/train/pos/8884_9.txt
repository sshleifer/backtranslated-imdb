I really liked the 60s. Not being of that generation (I'm waiting for "The 80's") it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that time. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems in the film, however, was how unbalanced the film was in the portrait of families. According to the promos I saw for the NBC movie, the story was basically of two families struggling with problems in 1960s America. Now, I may have lost something, but I think we learned more about the white family than about the African American family. <br /> <br /> I really think that The 60's uses music to better describe the scenes of any dialogue that could come out of the actors' mouths (all very talented). This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the miniseries. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
