This William Castle schlockmeister documentary makes some cheap shots in the naïve environment of the 50s and 60s where he did his most characteristic work - watch funny and silly people with ghost glasses - but he is also affectionate and lively, a particularly brilliant commentary by John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for these things at the time, and Castle's daughter, who adored her father and was also quite perceptive about how he dealt with his trade. (We never find out what became of Castle's other offspring.) The films weren't very good, it's clear, but his marketing was brilliant, and he seems to have been a sweet and hard-working family man. Funny people keep popping up, like Diane Baker of Straight Jacket, who is doing great, and Anne Helm, who replaced with the instigation of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman almost explodes into a happy laugh working with Castle in "The Tingler", and there are enough movies to give us an idea of ​​Castle's level of talent - not very high, but very energetic. A pleasant look at a time when the public was more easily satisfied and makes you nostalgic for the days when the film is easier.
