The group of people is traveling to Belgrade in a terrible bus driven by a drunk driver and his stupid son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events that, with much irony, describe the spirit of the fall of the nation in 1941 and are so funny that they are even used as jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a 4-foot tall farmer with his 4 children who are almost twice as big as him. In the end, the film takes a dramatic turn and the journey becomes nothing more than a swan song from a dying country.
