Being that I am a true product of hip-hop and electronic dance music generation, this is without doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as Wild Style, is a film that is guaranteed to jerk the strings of anyone who is proud of the DJ-based urban / music sample culture and electro-club culture. <br /> <br /> Although I will admit that sometimes the dialogue is a bit rough, you can't help feeling feelings for the characters, and in the end "I wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip culture -hop in New York City in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is equally essential for the archives of hip-hop fans like any classic album. Watch some of the slow-motion switch moves, if possible, to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic experience of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All the compliments to the Zulu Nation !!!
