It turned out to be a class production with what was supposed to be a low budget. The variety of characters is incredible, from ax-armed dwarfs to 7-foot ghouls! I liked the relationship between the contacts, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest alive. I also liked the mix of humor (which can be very easy to miss, too much / not enough) which meant that it didn't get too dark or too spoofy. It was a big step forward compared to the other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of plot and production. They have a great website that is worth checking out. I can't wait for Bane to arrive, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
