... in our house Like all the others who have commented on this film, my brothers (7 and 4 years old at the time) and I (10) would have watched this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always came back to it because of the great songs and the adventure. We all loved Camel and sang loudly with him during his song. There are some slow moments (the time spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we are generally bored after the song by The Knight ("The reason why {sound effect} is because you amooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo to save Babbette and the finale and they were all a little scared of the picture of King Koo-Koo floating there dominating the whole horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. I'm still singing "Hooray for me! Gay Paris babe!" I'm 33 years old looking at me as if I had lost my mind, but when I sing it, I'm 10 and I still remember the wonderful year of Star Wars.
