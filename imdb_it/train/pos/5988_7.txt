This 1939 film tried to take advantage of Michael Curtiz's "Angels with Dirty Faces". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how domesticated these guys were compared to what's happening today with young people in American neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be seen only for the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who have proven to be well coupled. The children of Dead End have larger parts as the plot focuses on them rather than on older people. <br /> <br /> In a sense it is curious how the fire was used in the same way that some scrupulous owners did in the following years right here in New York. It was the fastest way to turn a property around without ever considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The kids in history looked like simple pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!
