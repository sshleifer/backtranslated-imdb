This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo still plays Anna Christie, but all the other characters have actors other than the English version. Both were turned back in their hands because Garbo had a following in Germany. Garbo herself would have favored Anna Christie in this version compared to the English version. It's a good story and a must see for Garbo fans.
