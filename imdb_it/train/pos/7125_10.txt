Good night, Mr. Tom is so well shot and wonderfully made. It is not completely faithful to the book, but must it be? No not at all. John Thaw is as mesmerizing as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to thoughtful was so well done, making it more credible than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's best time. He was seriously approached by a young Nick Robinson, who provided a very convincing portrait of a displaced person traumatized by the violent relationship with her mother. The script and the music made it worthwhile, and you also see Thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene was that Willie discovered Zak's death, and then Tom told him about his deceased family who died of scarlet fever. Buy this, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
