Too bad that a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case. It is based on real events, a highly publicized disappearance and a murder case that takes place in the Wilmington region, DE / Philadelphia PA from '96 to 2000. I have to admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would have dramatized real history and events and was quite impressed by how close they were to what was constantly reported on local news and Philadelphia Inquirer news over the period of time. Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case) who played Fahey didn't look like her (Anne Marie was actually prettier). I must admit though that Mark Harmon has really nailed the kind of personality revealed as that of Capano and the behavior that Capano exhibited in this period. The details of the case were right about ... no deviation from the dramatic effect ... up to the carpet, the gun, the furniture and the refrigerator. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I met Tom Carper many times at various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so happy that he pulled the strings into the federal realm needed to solve this heinous crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was nice to see him finally put behind bars.
