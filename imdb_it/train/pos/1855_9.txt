Not having seen all the films released in 2002, I can't say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that it is the best film I have seen throughout the year. <br /> <br /> Most American films with people of color are obsessed with American concern over "racial relations", or fall into the clich√©s of the ghetto of the inner city, with every sterotype imaginable slang ebony. Antwone Fisher proudly stands alone in this regard: the race is irrelevant, except for a clash that may or may not have been caused by a racial insult. <br /> <br /> The story of Antwone Fisher is one that should resonate with any empathic individual. He is soberly and thoughtfully played by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his stellar power to make the film come true, remains mostly in the background and allows the film to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture in general want to keep the ghettoization of large numbers of Americans (and even Canadians, you know), this is a film that speaks to humanity in all of us. I only hope that the non-Black audience goes to see this movie for that humanity, rather than avoid it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie they can identify with. It would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America in and of itself. <br /> <br />
