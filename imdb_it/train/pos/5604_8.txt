If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", you should take a look at "The Tenant" as it is a similar concept, only with Polanski entering and playing schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favorites of his films - secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course - and it's a real journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim . The other residents of the building are all jagged and brawling in keeping the noise level low - even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big problem and Polanski, who is the protagonist, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his crazy hallucinations further and further as the film takes over. It gets to the point where it dresses and behaves like the former tenant and you realize that it's only a matter of time before he decides to reconstruct his fatal leap out the window ... The film is a bit slow and loitering for a while , but if you've ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know that it will end with a bang and this movie doesn't disappoint. It is also the best thing if you do not question the complications of the premise and take it simply as a descent into madness, because at times it is rather lively and surreal. Polanski is very good as the timid and unbalanced who, in some way, attracts the ever-illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We can also see him running around, which is disturbing and fun at the same time! Damn, it's for an ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who can really look beyond the thirty-year pedophile charges - should enjoy "The Tenant" as a fun head-on psychological journey ...
