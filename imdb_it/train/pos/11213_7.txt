This second film is as interesting as the previous one except there is no suspense. We know what it will do and what will happen before it is touched on the screen. So pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and from the succession of them. We know that there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose a wheel, that the car will have an accident, just to talk about the car. And this is what happens. Now the details and special features are for you to discover them in the film. The fact that he can be attracted to a stupid woman is obvious and must come, but we know that he has already seen her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. Now how are you going to get out of it? This is what you have to find out for yourself. And don't worry, he'll get the main trafficker, but how is another story. A fast boat is not up to our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he will be hurt. They didn't know what bulletproof jackets were in those days. It is true that recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on trafficking hunts and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that has no value what so can hinder this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these assets so that they can be properly observed and monitored? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is less fun to use them, to make them. It is forbidden or restricted that it is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
