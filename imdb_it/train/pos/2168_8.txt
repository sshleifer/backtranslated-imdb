I saw this movie on TV late one night ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has remained with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a little unoriginal - due to an earthquake, a subterranean deposit of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is violated, and a microscopic amount of the substance finds the his way into their food supply. The inhabitants of the city begin to lose their ability to exercise control over every basic whim and desire that floats through all our minds from time to time, and we normally know that we simply must not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but for me this has only helped to increase the discomfort as citizens' behavior slowly begins to unravel. There are many surreal and very disturbing scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our wildest instincts. I liked it? I'm not sure "enjoy" is the right word. It made me think? Definitely. I'm still thinking about it. Scary stuff.
