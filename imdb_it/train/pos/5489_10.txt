Very good the point: "only an elite of a few (the upper classes) would both have access to the Internet and would be able to communicate on an exclusively English-speaking site like the IMDb" Some might think that the Internet is not reality but this point of view You really put the media society and democracy on the line: you're probably right. Even if there is Internet cafe in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters will not even hire a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Fuck the liberal subversive capitalist upper class capitalist rich faschisti .. Probably this is the first time you use the Internet;) ..
