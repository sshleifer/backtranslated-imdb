Presented as the story of Steve Biko - played excellently by Denzel Washington, as one would expect - this was actually more of the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly Kline's starting point as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good at the role. Attenborough has given this kind of direction one expects, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the kind one can only cross. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was quite competent and did a good job, in what ends up being a sad story of a South Africa that is nowhere near the distant past.
