A great concept, a great cast, and what a pity there was no time left to enrich the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are real women! However, Dench and his character alone had enough substance to carry the script in some of his minor moments. I recorded it on tape and will continue to watch it, hoping that eventually there will be a clue suggesting that there will be a sequel. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - No question! - No argument! <br /> <br />
