This is a film that I can watch over and over again and never get tired, it has a lot of laughter, guns, action, crime, good jokes and a decent storyline, overtaking Donald Sutherland in a rather comical role like an Assasain. Tia Carerra looks warmer than ever and can act too, Thomas Ian Griffin is exceptional in this role as the protagonist "Max" an agent of the DEA Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow of Frazier on TV, he plays the villain, "Livingston". The plot focuses on Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston as they fight and discuss each other about who gets the money for their respective agencies, throw Assassain Sutherland, who has practically all the best liners, into the mix, that's the perfect crime , there is the usual love story, but he played very differently from what you would think Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, the Italian mafia and the Chinese mafia thrown in the mix here, the film is shot in Boston, where you have some great shots, and locals, excellent photography and music in this film, this film is just the epitome of a criminal comedy, it has everything you could want. Look at Sutherland's bathroom in a particular, very unusual scene. this movie is a riot and it will make you laugh really stronger than me.
