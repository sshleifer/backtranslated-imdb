A wonderful film version of the Broadway best-seller and the best-selling book on the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African American sisters who have both lived more than 100 years and told their story of a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform very well like Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also as good as Amy Hill Hearth, the New York Times white reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the current ones are very powerful, if not as inspiring as in the book. This is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that some aspects of the story are not clearly presented, such as the inter-racial background of the mother of the sisters and why their father was so strict. But apart from that, a very well made film, excellently interpreted and powerful.
