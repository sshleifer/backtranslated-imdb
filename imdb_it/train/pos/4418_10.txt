I saw him at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) did a Q & A later. I found it difficult to believe that he is a director at the first hour and all the compliments to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out for a script he liked. <br /> <br /> Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the turning point of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this to be a film about the revolution, its political position is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the obvious love of filmmakers in the history of cinema (a great tribute to "Bicycle Thief") and some extravagant scenes that work without pretensions. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
