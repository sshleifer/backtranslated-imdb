I saw this film when I was little - It was called "Glacier Fox". I was totally traumatized! A pretty family of foxes follows. The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the little foxes. I also remember my mother taking me out of the theater while I was in hysterics. I won't tell you what happened, but let's say it doesn't end for all the foxes. I was accustomed to Disney-type nature films in which the animals DID NOT REALLY. Oh God. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good film ... I think - I was very small and the truth was told - all I remember was being happy with foxes and then seeing one die. Rent it if you can, but don't show it to your children!
