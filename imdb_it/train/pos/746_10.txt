As I reach the "back" of 35 years, I find myself shaking my head more and more towards today's crazy and addicted teenagers. It was nice to remember that for me it was so crazy in my days as it is for today's teenagers. This film guides that point to the core. If you are a 70s fan, you will love the movie. From the KISS posters to an Angel concert, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> Watch for a young Laura Dern. Why haven't they had more Runaways songs than I will ever know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid who deflowered a 16-year-old girl. While she was away, she and her friends have a party that destroys the house of the dudes. The policemen arrive and everything, but does not mention all the minors who drink and how these guys got their hands on this stuff. <br /> <br /> The foxes belong right there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the all-time teenage movies. <br /> <br /> I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it.
