This film is a half-documentary ... and it's quite interesting .... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a group of Norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in Rukjan, Norway and delivery of the rest of the heavy water in Germany. <br /> <br /> This film is not perfect and could have been a little better ... the best part of the film is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of the Second World War and film this is a film that is worth a look !!
