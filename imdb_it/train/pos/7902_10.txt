The film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends it beyond aesthetics to music and cast. Throughout the film there is a childlike wonder seen through the eyes of the main character. His carefree vision of the world around us is comic and beautiful. In a sense it is a sloppy film for girls. Watch this like a relaxing midnight movie. Buy this if you like it differently take on the world of media and combined love (?).
