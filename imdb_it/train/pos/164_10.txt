Don't say I didn't warn you, but you'll laugh. Probably enough to hurt your stomach. Of course, there is blood splatter, all very funny. So, you have no budget, who needs a budget when you have a script like this. <br /> <br /> Take your time and watch this. It is worth a two-hour vision. If everyone laughed at what I did during this film, the world would be a much happier place to live. <br /> <br />
