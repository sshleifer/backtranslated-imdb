despite occasional acting and the story of "all-first-all", this is a pretty compelling film. <br /> <br /> He has suspense, the demon scenes are actually quite terrifying, some of the visuals are superb and, above all, there is no humorously misplaced humor to belittle the film, as too many hannabe) horror movies have in them now <br /> <br /> honestly, this is not the greatest film ever made, but in reality it attracts you and at least makes an attempt to develop the character <br /> <br /> I was happy to have seen it
