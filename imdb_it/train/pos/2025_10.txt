Anne Brontes' epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read in people's schools, libraries and salons. It's a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and marriages in ruins and a mother struggles to keep her son away from her brutal husband. It is so similar to today's stories that we see and hear and believe that people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on possible real experiences that the author had in 1840. <br /> <br /> Watch this film, it's a great version of the book and really moving. I'm sure Anne herself would have been happy with how it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and fantastic locations.
