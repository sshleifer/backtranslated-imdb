I bought this movie a few days ago and I thought it would be a pretty shitty movie. But when I inserted it into the DVD player, it surprised me very well. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But above all Timothy Dalton plays a great roll like the sheriff. The "end" scene in Bill's house is excellent, good camera work, pleasant dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie stole 12 million dollars from the mafia. Together with his wife he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the Mafia tracks him down and wants 12 million dollars. Bill can only trust the only person he knows inside, himself.
