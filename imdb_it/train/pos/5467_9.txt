In my opinion this must be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best interpretations. He was one of the few actors, then and now, who could say more with one look than an entire page of dialogue. And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored film, with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. Too bad the film is so short. Lily is a young woman who barely keeps him working for her father in her illegal underground. His only connection to anything is his good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African American (and having a white woman as a best friend to a black woman in the 1930s was controversial as the subject of this film), and Lily is not, they have a special connection. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women got stuck, or pushed, in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies and doesn't know what to do, she is told that she has the power to go out and get what she wants. Yes, it is immoral, but this is the central point of this film. Then "they" had to go and ruin the last few minutes. So, until the last few minutes of the film, it is a superb film and worth watching. The film's "lesson" is still as valid today as it was then, and I'm sure in 100 years. Women, what Lily does to get what she wants is horrible, but it works. Men, take note.
