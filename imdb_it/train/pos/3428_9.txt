I saw this movie tonight in New York at the Landmark Sunshine. I didn't know what to expect, I wouldn't read much because I knew I would see it at all costs. All in all, it's very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which for me has left politics out. The soldiers mainly talked about their awareness of toxicity in their training in training, and how difficult it was to return to civilian life. It was really nice to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia talking about the difficulty in surviving not only in the war, but in refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morality. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. Whoever says it has not seen it or lives with the scars of war on their souls.
