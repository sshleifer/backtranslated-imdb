As a child, I loved this game. I played it a million times during the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I was playing Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played we never got bored. Then came Streets of Rage 2. And we immediately forgot that this even existed. <br /> <br /> Play as the former cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have left the strength to face the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels in which to work in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr. X. Bare all the baddies and the end-of-level boss is a lot of fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my favorite because you could send the bad guys down the holes in the river. You also have the option of becoming Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad ending" in which you become the union leader. Exactly how much is possible this is a mystery since you destroy the union while you go to Mr. X, but it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro has done absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are extraordinary songs. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner I am proud to have it forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it makes the first one a bit obsolete. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> Medium graphics but pleasant backgrounds represented in a comic book as a progression of the panel that adapts to the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great tunes. <br /> <br /> Easy to insert and difficult to suppress. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2. <br /> <br /> Poor IA enemy. Bad guys often turn away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is particularly irritating for the level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> Lack of combo moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Bad guy models repeat far too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B-
