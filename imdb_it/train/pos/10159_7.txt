There are few films or films that I consider favorites over the years. The path of the Gospel was one of them. I saw this as a young teenager and I would like the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / the last dinner was a huge meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he enjoyed playing with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and for all times. <br /> <br /> The film may not have been theologically valid or played in high quality, but it touched my heart at the time. I'm also a fan of Johnny Cash and it was a brave undertaking. If it ever comes on DVD, I will buy it exclusively for sentimental reasons.
