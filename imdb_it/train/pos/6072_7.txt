Branagh and Fishburne offer excellent performances in this version of the Shakespeare classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the character played in a movie or on stage. Some might say that this film is excessively Iago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of cinema ironically, offers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the Moro di Venezia could be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. The character of Desdemona is much deeper than what he has in the drama. In this film, it may not even be added at all. One of the worst cuts Branagh made in this film was the removal of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she plays as in this movie. There were a number of subtractions that damage the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you haven't read the script or you've already seen a film version of Othello, I recommend this movie. The plot, cut or not, is still incredibly addictive. Acting, as previously stated, is very good. If some important scenes had been added and the Desdemona character had priority a little later, this would have been a great movie. As it is, it is still an admirable version of the original. I give him a marginal recommendation.
