Diagnosis Murder has been shown on most afternoons of the week on BBC1 since I watched him while I was at school a good 10 years ago - I know I shouldn't enjoy it, in the same way that I shouldn't enjoy 'Murder she Wrote' but I'm totally dependent on both and I even have DVD box-sets .... OK I know it's sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke brings the show while he is the protagonist of Dr. Mark Sloan Doctor at LA Community General Hospital, who is also the LAPD police advisor - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke, real son of Dick) is a police officer, who needs his father's help for many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> Along with the ride there is Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), a resident pathologist at the Community General, and for the first couple of seasons you had Scott Baio who plays Dr. Jack Stewart, who raised and left the series in 1995, hoping to get on with bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, he hasn't done anything important since then ... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Genius 2: Superbabies .... Oh Dear !!! <br /> <br /> however, Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by the younger Dr.Jesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter who stepped on Baio's shoes quite comfortably. <br /> <br /> The series is highly implausible, but which series of Whodunit is not? (Murder wrote - everywhere Jessica goes, someone ends up dead, or The underestimated father Dowling Mysteries about a priest who solves the murders with a nun aide) <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter until 1997, because was a supporting cast that included the uncompromising Hospital manager Norman Briggs played by Michael Tucci along with Nurse & Mark Dolores secretary, played by Delores Hall, after 1997 both of these characters were no longer included and the series became a business gray with a bigger budget, some episodes included much more action, one episode the entire hospital blew up. <br /> <br /> This was a family show for Van Dyke because, in addition to Dick's Son Barry, he also had Dick's Daughter and all his grandchildren an appearance in various episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series progressed it became a bit silly, an episode that I remember Dick van Dike playing all his family, which was a little out of the ordinary, but on the Whole 'Diagnosis Murder' it was a A really nice television program that has had numerous guest stars. <br /> <br /> Since this show ended in 2001, Dick & Barry appeared together again in the TV movie series "MURDER 101" produced by The Hallmark Channel, quite a lot following the same path, and anyway enjoyable. Dick, who is now around 80 years old, does not seem to change much, and it seems he will work to the end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUTSIDE *** **
