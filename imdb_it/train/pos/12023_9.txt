A shift in perspective is necessary to enjoy modern British films, one that somehow allows them to be seen in their right and for their qualities rather than according to the criteria that are judged by American films. The Britfilm must strive to be gritty and has difficulty doing so, but in the heat British films can dominate their otherwise overwhelming competitor. <br /> <br /> This film does not fail in its content, but only in attaching itself to its predecessor, thus allowing it to be easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their strings. It's a couple of decades later, Gregory taught and this time with two girls on the head. He teaches at his school rails against human rights violations. When students are fired they find abuses among themselves, they have to face if it's just a speech. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive film in that there is not the usual mundane character of any American film that you expect to do anything it does, but a naive guy who can still put everything in line for principles . Could be. Certainly it is not a protest by number, being too hot. In US films that may seem realistic because urban and gritty, this and other British films of recent years - those that do not try to match America with visceral chills - are real because British humor reveals truth.
