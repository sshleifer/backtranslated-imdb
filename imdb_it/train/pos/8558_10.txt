Always enjoy the great acting of Drew Barrymore and his great performance in this film, where he plays a very very complicated girl, (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts", 2000, who leaves New York and travels to California and shares an apartment with an emerging writer, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things start to happen to Holly and she tries to find her brother in a mental institution after killing her father. If you look close enough you will see Drew Barrymore's mother in real life look like her mother in this photo. If it wasn't for the good acting of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen on Halloween night! However, surely he has some surprises in the END !!!!
