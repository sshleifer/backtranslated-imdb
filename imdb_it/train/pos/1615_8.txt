Wonderful romantic comedy about an Italian widow (Cher) who is planning to marry a man she is well with (Danny Aiello) until he falls for his stubborn and angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is sharp and full of lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I was told) are literally perfect and the cinematography is beautiful. New York has never been so beautiful on the screen. A must-see in the first place for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - both the Oscars they have obtained are both fantastic and fully deserved. A beautiful and fun movie. A must see!
