I saw this movie Thursday night after a really boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were rather negative. Being that the only movie I've ever seen Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... don't ask why! But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with the character of Fallon. Because I can't meet a nice nerd like that. :) Movies like that are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Thursdays Sunday I'm not even a sports fan, but it's about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we don't have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first ever comment.) Haha
