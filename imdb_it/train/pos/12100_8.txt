The "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) DVD is very strange. This is because the parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is nicknamed in French from the French. Sometimes the characters passed between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to make the movie simply subtitled or simply nicknamed, it made no difference! Strange, but still watchable. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a Poe story, although I can't remember which one. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and end of the film - though he didn't seem particularly his. <br /> <br /> A rich man makes a bet with a guy who can't manage he can't stay all night in a way home. It seems an easy bet to win, even if the house is very scary. However, it can't be that easy, as the rich man says that all those who previously took the bet are dead - yet this stupid STILL wants to make the bet! While at home, he meets the adorable Barbara Steele and falls madly in love with her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than ten years ago! How can it be ?! I could tell you more about the plot but I don't want to spoil the suspense. See it yourself to discover the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film gets very high marks for creating a gruesome atmosphere. The house, the cinematography and the black and white music work together to create a film with an eerie aspect. As for the plot, it is interesting - especially because there are many twists and turns - so many that you are wondering who it is and who is not among the undead at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The only negative aspect is that I was sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed. Crazy as it may seem, I was sorry and it didn't seem necessary. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity. An extraordinarily beautiful woman appears topless, but it is not necessary for the plot.
