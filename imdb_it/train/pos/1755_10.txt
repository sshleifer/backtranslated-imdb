This film is a revolt. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun in the cinema. I've seen some good plays in my time and they are usually pretty funny. But this is great from wall to wall. I think Best in Show is the last movie in which I laughed so much and so much. The film was directed until the end when they made the 5 minute cleanup of the sentimental plot. Apart from this it is a constant burst of a liner and full situations. I'd like to see it again before you leave the theater because this is like Zucker's films where you don't make all the jokes the first time. You have to see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> As for the real movie, he could have used a better modification, sometimes it's unstable, but we have to forgive him for that. All the characters are fantastic. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the target of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so nice. No victims in this film. Also, thank God they had a 45-year-old actress to play her girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays it and she's a better half in this movie. You just hope that women like her really existed. It is not a "10" like some of the main women, but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts who exaggerated overbite. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie you may not think about it too much. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They don't give away all the good jokes. Only some of the mediocre ones. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing. I hope the critics put this in their top ten list. Many of them complain that the comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and therefore at the end of the year they do not include it in their list. This means that Ebert !!!
