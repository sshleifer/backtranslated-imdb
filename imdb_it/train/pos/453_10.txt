I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is a film for adults without bad feelings, without sex and without violence. You might think it's "the last movie for girls", but I bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too. Don't invite children, though. This film is very low-key. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healthy experience. The soundtrack and the splendid scenery, together with the gentle ways of women, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> In order for no one to think that yours is just a type of film, I paraphrase a phrase I once heard on "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite films are "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
