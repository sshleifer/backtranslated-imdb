OK, let's make it clear. I'm not very fond of science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil brings his SG-1 team through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. It might seem like your usual science fiction series, but it isn't! The plot is set today not in a distant millennium like many other science fiction series. I find it fantastic. It gives you things, events and things you can relate to, and you can jump to the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all gadgets. They have some, of course, but thanks to O'Neil who likes to maintain simple terminology, there aren't many. <br /> <br /> The series has a nice mix of action, humor and drama. If you like many special effects, you won't find it here. They don't use many bad guys, but a limited amount of well-made special effects.
