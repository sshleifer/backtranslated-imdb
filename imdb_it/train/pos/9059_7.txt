This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this film to be word for word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is a new baby in town named Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy must eat 10 worms in a day or the bully's victories. <br /> <br /> Acting is OK, probably the worst part of the film. Young actors exaggerate on many things. They think it's an apocalypse if Billy doesn't eat worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job, though. <br /> <br /> The plot is as good as a movie, but it sucks as an adaptation of the book. I was able to watch this movie without looking at the moment .... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good family film with some weaknesses. I consider this film 7/10.
