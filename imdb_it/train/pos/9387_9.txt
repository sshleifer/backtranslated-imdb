As others have commented, I verified it after Siskel and Ebert listed it as one of the 10 best films of the year. What a gift I then went to buy it, just to be able to lend it. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is at the top of his taxi. When Cage peeks, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum puts the gun on Cage's face with "Looks like I'm afraid?" A little humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> There was really a sense of fun for this. The constant sighting of the signal "Welcome to Red Rock" provokes a moan and a smiling grin. The music has created a hunting quality, disturbing for the film that recalls "Twin Peaks". Unlike "Twin Peaks", however, it doesn't hurt things by going too far in the bizarre, needing "top". <br /> <br /> I admit I saw the credits 15-20 times. You see, they got Yoakum's "Mille Miglia dalla nulla" (perfectly chosen) as a freight train that curved over the desert floor. . with snow-capped mountains in the distance. It was an incredible and fluid frame. Moreover, I have never seen a better unification of sight and sound on the film. Moreover, it fits perfectly into the story.
