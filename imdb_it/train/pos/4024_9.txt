I really enjoyed this movie. I kept guessing until just before the end what would happen. One of the best movies about the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is also beautiful. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen on the partition. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar, and it's really an emotional roller coaster where you start off with an opinion about what's going on, and get out the other side completely. This is not the typical Bollywood fare, but rather an art-house movie. The best part of this film is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when it focuses on the story of another. It does not blame or punish, but rather allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
