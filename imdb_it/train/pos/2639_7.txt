Being a fan of the first Lion King, I couldn't wait to see this movie, but I knew there was really no way to live up to the original. I know that many Disney fans are wary of video-directed films, as I too have mixed feelings about them. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1½, I tried to understand what my point of view was about this movie. Will I be so devoted to The Lion King that I'm going to fur in some scenes, or will I only accept this film as another look at The Lion King's story? Most of the time, I found myself embracing the latter. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ certainly has its cute and fun moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and certainly deserved a film about them. People love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include the editing of Timon & Pumbaa who takes care of the young Simba and the surprise ending with some great cameos. <br /> <br /> I could have done without many lines in the bathroom, like the real reason why everyone bowed to Baby Simba at the beginning of the Lion King 1. I think those types of lines are for the younger set (which is the target audience, after all.) I don't think many children are really worried about the profit margin of Disney directly -to-video film.) <br /> <br /> However, I will say that I was a little annoyed when have directly linked scenes from the original film to this film. I know too well the original that those scenes seemed to me barely pungent. Something would be different with the music or the voices that would have only distracted me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it wasn't bad, but don't expect the classics to come from this movie. At least LK2 had the beautiful ballad, "Love Will Find a Way." As for the voicing, it was well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always, and even the new cast members, the classic comedian Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (better known as Marge Simpson), did a great job too. You can also have fun with these great vocal talents by checking the Virtual Safari on disc 2 of the DVD. That feature is certainly a lot of fun !! <br /> <br /> So all in all, The Lion King 1½ isn't a perfect movie, but it's cute and fun. I think many Lion King fans will appreciate and appreciate it for what it is - a fun and carefree look at the Lion King's masterpiece from the perspective of our funny friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)
