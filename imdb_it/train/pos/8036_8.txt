Some think that the sniper is not good because the action part is not good enough. Well, if you consider it an action movie, this point of view could be quite true because the action part of this film is not really exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one. <br /> <br /> The film told us mainly about two snipers who had different personalities and experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed killings, looked as if he had a cold heart. However, after Beccket showed his Montana day dream, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and the sacrifice of his partners that made Beccket so called with a cold heart. <br /> <br /> Millar, by contrast, was a newcomer, a green hand, and he wasn't even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did well enough to show Millar's hesitation and fear when he tried to "plant a bullet in the heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought of the suicide mission was that it could be easily realized and then he could easily go back and receive the prize. <br /> <br /> These two guys were very different in their personalities and I think the film had successfully demonstrated the difference and impact they had between them due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and eventually came to understand from the communication and from what they had done to help even save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological one.
