I just saw the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - a perfect delight - well made, moving, fun, dramatic and intensely meaningful. Could not agree more. I just hope the rest of the Festival's films reach this level of entertainment and I'm looking forward to seeing other Chinese films scheduled to be shown in Sydney in the coming months.
