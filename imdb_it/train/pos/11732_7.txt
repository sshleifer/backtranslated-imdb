OK, I saw it in theaters when it came out and I don't know why. I haven't seen him since, but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this movie - I still don't know why. But the fact of remembering him speaks at length. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard, much more difficult than any drama. Doing it right makes it look easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, be careful, you're falling into this category for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done well to remember this movie fondly. Made at a fast pace, with the tongue in the mouth and knowing that it is not the story of Philedelphia, he entertains himself from beginning to end. Brain Donors is another one that adapts to this category (without most of the boob free jokes). <br /> <br /> A point of contention: the ending. It seems that the writers / directors had no idea how to end a play. The ending tries to be a love story, somehow undermining the bizarre and fast dialogue up to that point. Then there is the "tassle" scene. Considering that this must be seen (masculine opinion), it is so over the top and out of place it is like a shock. Another rewrite was needed for the finale. <br /> <br /> Not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you don't try to dissect it and let word games and fun know how to come to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee it.
