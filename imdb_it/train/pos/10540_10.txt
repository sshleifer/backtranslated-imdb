I can only agree with the taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. Imagination on display, visual interpretation of the script, humor are constantly surprising. The two protagonists are fantastic and really bring the movie. My advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the movie and watch without expectations. I rented from the blockbuster movie, so it's easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will like it, but I think most people will have an opinion and this is always good, unless it's just "was stupid". I loved this movie, you can't see the gem that way every day. This should become a favorite cult. Give it a try, you can just feel the same way about it as I do.
