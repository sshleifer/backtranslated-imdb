This is short and to the point. The historiography used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Acting is all over the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will arrive at the end of mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat what has already been said about set design and graphics. Considering that this is all voluntary, non-profit, it is rather surprising. <br /> <br /> If this were classified as a professional production, I should give it a 5 for a good story but terrible series. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give an excellent evaluation, with the exception of some other efforts, this is in a separate league. For the pure volume, I don't think this was matched. Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that I many admire.
