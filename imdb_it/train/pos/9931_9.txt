I rented the domino on a whim, not even knowing that it was inspired by a true story, and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see. I found it rather fantastic. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly he writes that he combined a mass of plots and narrations in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once you understand it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a bounty hunter model that leaves the perfect life in Hollywood to pursue a career that is not so subtle or perfect. He has a strong acid tour style provided by director Tony Scott. And with fast music and editing, it provides the visual glow to keep your attention, with slick shows and unexpected comedies, the film is well done and fun and should have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who wants to think and have fun at the same time for 2 hours.
