These two stars are the only iconic heroes / criminals I know who got a good TV series, so let's compare. <br /> <br /> Freddy - 7 Robocop films - 3 films <br /> <br /> Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 Robocop episodes - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes <br /> <br /> Freddy - 2 more films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop: First Directives: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection) <br /> < br /> Freddy - 1 film coming out of Robocop - 1 film coming out <br /> <br /> Who had the most screen time? Well, they both had 7 movies, 1 TV series and 1 film coming out. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one of which is a fan movie) and 17-18 TV episodes. <br /> <br /> As this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The Series I would personally choose Robocop ...
