.... Rather well done, actually - attacking evil villains in their den, stopping a Big Big Horn-style ambush, saving the day through waterboys bugling, works for me. High English lip and everything else. <br /> <br /> So how does it work on a DVD 66 years later? It seemed to me to be a Western Apaches or underground or Sioux for the Thugs and the American cavalry for the British imperial army. It's very colonial in its perspective, you know? The white man's burden and all the rest? Kipling would surely have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play it as widely as possible, putting a certain companion in the mix between shootings and fights. (I had no idea it was Joan Fontaine as the wife of the army of pawns - did they leave some of her scenes on the floor of the editing room? Very short-) None of them was aiming for an Oscar here - in fact Grant wasn't its best in some scenes - but firm, still works. And how else will Ben Casey end up as an Indian trumpet player? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. check it out if you like pseudo-western style adventures. It was done by a group of professionals, I could add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
