I was worried that my daughter might have a wrong idea. I think the character of "Dark-Heart" is a bit rough and I don't like the way it turns into a "bad" frog, fox, kid ?? I was wrong, this film was made for my son, not for me. She "understands" when she went over (under?) My head. Of course I don't "understand" it. This is not one of the NEW children's movies that even adults will appreciate. This is right for young people, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no junk political ether. There is no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, no one has the right to access the excess and everyone is not happy all the time. And as a side benefit, no one DIES! ?? russwill.
