I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was so impressed. Everything was superb. The acting of the characters, the story. A credible child who has become brave, always ready to help others. His mother must be proud. I couldn't look away from this movie for fear of losing something. It is the fable / fable prefect with morality, cute and frightening sprite and "monsters", but still moving people. A child has been beaten and bullied at school who becomes a hero. Chosen to be a knight at the local village festival and a trip to Goblin Mountain where he discovers the Yokai, which are incredible creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil Kato and his off sider who surely needed a hug. These evil people capture the Yokai and throw them into a red hole along with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and these merge into a horribly violent robotic monster whose only job is to kill. Takashi is a young boy who becomes their savior, alongside a red / dragon man, a turtle man and a River Princess, as well as a cute little creature that, if it was America, could have turned it into a stuffed animal and sold to all good toy stores. The lines are good in particular not to try it at home children and other gems that bring a smile to the lips. Suspend your beliefs and watch this with a child or alone and have fun! Although I must admit that the end was a bit sad. And not necessarily so. Greetings Furdion
