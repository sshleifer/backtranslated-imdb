Now I've always been a fan of Full Moon's puppet work. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of those better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works wonderfully, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a top quality job. Gary Graham, who really made his mark on TV in shows like ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be an action star who kicks his ass and gets his name. The stop motion effects could have been slightly better. The color was wrong, they looked like plastic instead of the metal they should have been. But this is a minor complaint compared to the whole which is the Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 STARS ON 10.
