In general I like something light and fun, so this film shouldn't have interested me. But he grabbed me from the beginning. The story of a family's choices and challenges seems obvious, but it raises the question over and over again: "What if it's my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did because I really felt what the people felt. It was in places that were difficult to look at, but more difficult to remove. The story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch! Show what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a beautiful story all by itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. As in real life, you don't really know what will happen next, or why people do the things they do!
