I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show manages to put a smile on my face with its great narrative, witty dialogue and acting. But that's not all: he even manages to keep you to the end. The idea behind the show: bringing people back to life with just one touch, ending the undead with a second, is interesting and could still be in later seasons. But the suspense murder cases, the unique appearance of the show and the very skillful narrator add to the experience. But "pushing the daisies" is more than parts. He has a certain charm that I really like and can't wait to enter the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
