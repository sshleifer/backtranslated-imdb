Brilliant film, the next best film of The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS and haven't seen this movie in 15 years, but still as good as it was then. The acting was terrible and dubbing was even worse, but it's those features that make this film (and many other old Chinese kung-fu movies) great. The choreography is fantastic and the plot is fundamental. I've never seen Shaolin's 36th room but I know it's the same film but Gordon Liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr Return To The 36th Chamber is played by a different character. It has a lot of comic and brilliant kung-fu value.
