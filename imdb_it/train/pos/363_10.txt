This film is about development. People grow and people fade, people surprise and people disappoint. It has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It is really a classic drama that has some fantastic performances by the cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in his debut role. <br /> <br /> This film made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this film should be mandatory every Saturday in every prison in the world - touch your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
