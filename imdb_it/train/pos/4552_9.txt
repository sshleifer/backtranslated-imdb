Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances ever from an actor. He is as brilliant as Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is as formidable as the young Christy Brown and Ray McAnally is as big as his father. It is worth looking for outstanding performance.
