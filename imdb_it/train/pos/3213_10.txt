What a perfect example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in empty spaces, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture, everything combines to make a stronger impact. This is one of those 5 best films I can't live without, right there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked it, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" both with Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was also in Soldier. The "Thirteenth Warrior" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford.
