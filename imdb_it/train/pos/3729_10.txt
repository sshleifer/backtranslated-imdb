While I imagine this film could be considered Anti-Vietnam rap, as I watched it I didn't think it was as much as the film was simply an honest look at the perspective of young boys trained for a war that the public didn't support ... showed their fear, their desperation, their drive ... everything, out in the open, naked. As a soldier myself, many of the themes have been faithful to me in my military experience, especially in the training field. Overall this film, even though it was shot on a very small budget, looks fantastic, is very well put together, and presents excellent acting and directing. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell film. 10/10
