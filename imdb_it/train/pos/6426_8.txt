One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies that I liked. This was the phase in which Govinda went strong with Dhawan. The songs were fantastic and totally as we call it "masti". An evergreen entertainer with the likes of Anupam Kher. The plot has many hilarious scenes as is known for the sill producers of David Dhawan. With a timely appearance by Ms. Madhuri "Nen" Dixit, it was a total riot towards the end. It was nice to see Amit perform so hard and humorous after a long exile. Although some might consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" film, I would watch it every day. I'm giving him an easy 8 out of 10 just to be pure Bollywood.
