This will be a different kind of review. I have seen this movie twice on TV and I would like to have a copy because it speaks of Panama City and the beach in winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I had seen from Ashley Judd and she was fantastic and I enjoyed everything else I saw her in. The Sundance reaction also had an impression on me, as did director Victor Nunez, who has directed and written several films on Florida. This film speaks to me and I have not seen anything with which to compare it. The plot speaks to me less about the surroundings. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
