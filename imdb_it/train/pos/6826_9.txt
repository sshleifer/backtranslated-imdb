"Opening Night" by John Cassavetes is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination, fascinating because it never ceases to surprise us. With its long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates the characters will not be able to look away from the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon, (Gena Rowlands) trying to get together for a game, fighting her demons; "Opening Night" is not just about a woman on the brink of a crisis, but also the complexities of the lives of theatrical actors and the theatrical world. All of Cassavetes' characters here are experienced people who know the world of theater; so half of the film takes place on a stage, where performers do their job or backstage, where producers, writers and directors do their job. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so hard on his characters that this rudeness turns to the public, but the audience to the cinema. Because there is another audience, in the movie theater, who doesn't know what's really going on and laughs because he thinks everything is a performance. And this is essentially what it is; it's just that the audience in the theater can't see "backstage" like we do. They do not experience the exuberance of Gena Rowlands before going to that stage, but above all; they don't know the reasons why he behaves like her. <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she's an actress and that's the only thing she can do; and I imagine that if I had a friend who was a professional artist, it would be really hard to tell when he is telling the truth because I know he is an actor and can pretend anything at any time. Many of the things Myrtle does during the terrible experiences that the film puts on the stage? We suspect you are real; even the rest of the characters suspect. <br /> <br /> There's the writer, Sarah (Joan Blondell), who can't understand why Myrtle doesn't understand the character she wrote for her. There is the director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who cannot accept the fact that his best actress could have lost her; the producer David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where to stay and the co-star of Myrtle, Maurice (the same Cassavetes), who cannot face the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When you witness the death of a teenager, a fan; all this joins and hits Myrtle, but nobody knows if his disappointments are real. They say nothing because they don't want to upset her, but the film enters a subconscious state that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes, we can say that everyone has had it. In these moments, Cassavetes' brilliant script depicts a frightening brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a backstage discussion; and not just what everyone says to Myrtle, but also what they tell them. <br /> <br /> Here there are people who are not afraid to speak their minds and are constantly changing what they think, just like Cassavetes' way of making films. And in this respect, the performances are more important here than in "Shadows", because the characters are involved in a larger picture; a bigger story that comes from the most banal. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way of making films, this film is no different from "Shadows". There is a beautiful thing in the way that Al Ruban's camera takes the characters. When someone speaks, the camera does not focus on him, shoot the person who is listening; so we can see how he reacts to the things the other is saying. Sometimes they don't care, sometimes they're happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation could still be there, though, among all these wonderful performances. Towards the end, there is an unexpected scene in which Cassavetes and Rowlands begin to talk nonstop. Whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to ask ourselves. We just have to watch; and watching both exchange life experiences and see words become true in a conversation that means much more than what it shows? It doesn't become more natural than that.
