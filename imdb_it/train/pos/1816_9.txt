Many reviews on this page indicate that this film is a little obscure for children. It depends on the child. This is not a film for 2-6 years; it is more oriented towards 8 years and the older crowd. I saw this film when I was 10, I loved it. At the time the most animated films were a bit too childish for my taste. This film deals with more serious problems and therefore has a slightly more emotional impact. In this film the characters can die and be sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes in which the characters risk their lives. Good guys are not always perfectly sweet and cute (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always in black and white. <br /> <br /> Great movie
