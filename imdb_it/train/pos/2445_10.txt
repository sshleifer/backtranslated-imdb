I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed to know recently that George Lopez is a racist and that he fired Masiela Lusha, simply because he discovered he was not a Latin emigrant, but that he was an emigrant from Albania. I learned it from the show people. It was really one of the best parts of the show, and so, to learn that even among those you would think would be sensitive to racism, who can even hate someone, just for the country where they were born, it's really disappointing.
