I was quite young when it came out in the US, but I recorded it from TV and watched it over and over again until I memorized everything. Even today I catch myself quoting it. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. The voices were fantastic, and they sounded just like the characters they were portraying. Even the puppets were well made, even if a little scary. I was surprised to find out only recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I also like a lot. As another person had written in a comment before, I too was robbed of this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I wish there was enough demand for this show to guarantee a DVD version, but I don't think enough people have heard of it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
