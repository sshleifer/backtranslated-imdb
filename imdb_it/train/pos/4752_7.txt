A crazy story of a Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be pretty bad on Mars.) Two state troops investigate the scene of a reported UFO incident. Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond, but there are steps in the snow that lead to a nearby restaurant. <br /> <br /> Dinner has not had customers since eleven o'clock that morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that there are now 7 people waiting for the journey to resume. One of them is an alien, but which one? All of them are suspicious. There is the old fool (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise sub pink talent. There is a bold businessman who must arrive in Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Executive performance by her husband, Ron Kipling). Except for couples, nobody noticed anyone else. And even couples are suspicious of each other. He marries his newly coined husband: "I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin". The story continues in a lively but slightly sinister way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights come on and off, the juke box turns on and none of these are taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It is a very pleasant ensemble and the climatic revelation is worth a little laugh. There is no "depth" visible to it. It is not a moral message about the pod people masquerading as ordinary citizens. It is not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that distracts and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always like it when it's on. It is particularly interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman senator who devised the murder of Julius Caesar in the MGM version of Shakespeare's play. And here it is - three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops.
