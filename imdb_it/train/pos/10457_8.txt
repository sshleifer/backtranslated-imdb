Forget the 'religious' films sampled that have monopolized the TV / cinema market ... this film has a real feeling. Although it can be considered a film that has economic attractiveness, it also has that message of forgiveness and good general morality. However, I did not like the lighting in this film ... for a film that dealt with such subjects, it was too bright. It seemed to me that it was removed from the general appeal of the film, which is almost an unpardonable sin, but the recognizable cast, and its performances contrast this oversight. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing ... buying the DVD.
