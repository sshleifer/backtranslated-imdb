What do you expect from a movie called "Surviving Christmas" and presented as "festive fun", something like Ghandi or English patient? There are many things I love about this movie, it's fun, it's very well done and it's superbly written. I came to the film as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort but I was doubtful when I read the plot, it seemed ridiculous. But the film does not come across this way because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays his part perfectly, a minute an adult as a child, the next a mature man who realizes he has earned everything in life regardless of what he wants really. In fact we see Latham growing in this film, when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his fate is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This the film has fewer weak scenes or dud than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is much more difficult than any other kind of drama, or it works or not and very few comedy writers correct it every time. I particularly liked the dramatic scene, where the family is dedicated to reading parts written by Latham. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and in the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing at the Christmas tree to earn the cash prize that keeps the film moving long. <br /> <br /> The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) in history brings a delightful romantic corner, and why not in a Christmas movie? Certainly its banal and artificial; he's rich and handsome, he's handsome and single, and so inevitably she and Afflect end up falling together in the snow and being face to face. Great! One thing I would have liked was the use of festive music to increase the atmosphere, but I can't really complain. I got what I wanted.
