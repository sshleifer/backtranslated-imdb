This film features cinematic artistic techniques in which, instead of the landscape that catches the eye of the camera, there are small details about how someone appears, how the woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. As the husband could wear a hat, socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely comfortable and comfortable. The provocation of women is another of the characteristics of the picture that the director chooses to let us know that he is sexually a free spirit and aims to get the pleasure he seeks without flirting directly or with a particular sensitivity towards what man can experience. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is open in which it holds nothing, does not feel particularly ashamed for how it behaved and wants to share these facts with him because his main goal is always the fact of their marriage. Nothing and nobody can come between them. Only the possibilities of fate can intervene: his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return to the end. A very intriguing film that is totally engaging.
