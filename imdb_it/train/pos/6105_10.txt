All Kira Reed fans MUST see it. The premise of the film sees the struggling novelist Kira incapable of inventing new ideas. He's also devouring a divorce. However, he meets this guy in a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothes). They go to a corner room and do it. Luckily, Kira gets a condom (Now never tell me these Playboy movies are useless stacks of soft stuffed toys: remember the kids, safe sex). Later, he is surprised with his publisher how nice he was, but he didn't get his name. Despite this, the boy finds her and continues their vicious games. But in the end he gets tired of his imprudence and wants to learn more. When it does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that point. This is easily the best of these Playboys soft-core movies I've seen. Watch him and marvel at the greatness of Kira.
