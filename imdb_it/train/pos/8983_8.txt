Shot in the car by through the windshield, someone is playing someone else's last song, someone else has not reacted, according to the voiceover. I just wonder how it was done. There were too many scenes in this film that I wondered why a camera was there. If the scenes shot where Warhol descended on a BJM post-party are true, then that was an unforgivable exploitation at most, otherwise, then it was a total invention, in both cases it made me uncomfortable, if was that the purpose? Throughout the film, I kept wondering what the movie was like. Taken by face value, a beautiful portrait of the (tortured) genius that we all believe to be.
