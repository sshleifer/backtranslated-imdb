De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but for me it was a success. A young grinning idiot becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It's a detailed and crisp story of the innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and unleashed police forces, but slowly evolves into a magical fantasy tale, while the boy asks Toto to develop unlimited superhero powers. I had up to here with the Toto always smiling after 10 minutes, and when the magic took over, I was left in the dust. There were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers, that I kept thinking that it was a waste the film was no longer serious with its material. The coupling between neorealism and fantasy emerges more as a "look-like-we-can-also-do-it-type" experiment than as a fully developed piece of work / art.
