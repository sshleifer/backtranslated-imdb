The US State Department would not want us to see this film because they have a meat to the Iranian government. However, it shows us how truly civilized Iran is, despite the film's content, which focuses on women's struggle for the same rights in the simplest way: the ability to watch a football match at the stadium, which is strictly limited to male audience only. The film is hilariously amusing, and in itself is the proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I really enjoyed this movie. Five girls try to penetrate the police border at the doors of the tickets for a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The ensuing comedy is too fun to describe, from the bus trip to the stadium, to police intervention and the subsequent detention of the girls until the end. Don't miss this classic movie. It is a must see. One of the best foreign films I've seen in years.
