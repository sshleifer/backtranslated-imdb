THE BEAVER TRILOGY is, without doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was lucky to have taken it, along with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris, at the NY Video Festival some years ago and then I bought a copy from Trent's website. This film must be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching for the name of Trent on the web and then purchasing the film from his site. He's an incredibly nice guy. Don't get confused: the cameraman in the fictitious sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent! <br /> <br /> After seeing TRILOGY a few times, I must admit that I could probably do without the Penn Sean Version. It's like a trial version for the "Orkly Kid" section of Crispin Glover and is more interesting as an object of curiosity if you're a Penn fan than a good video. Penn is pretty funny though, and you can see the ingredients of a great star in this gritty black and white video. <br /> <br /> It is probably also one of the best roles of Crispin Glover and I'd just like to see a documentary update on the original Groovin 'Gary. Once you've seen this movie, you'll never have Gary's nervous laugh from your head again.
