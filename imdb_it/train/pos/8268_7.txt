This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been shot first in 1911 and 1918. And, in many ways, it reminds me of the next film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films are about a presumptuous asshole who arrives in one of the best schools in the world and both, in the end, show the hard blow by learning slowly about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role, Jack Pickford - always remembered as Maria's brother. Of these three, Pickford takes the best, as the understanding loser who becomes Tom's friend - he actually has some decent scenes and a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clich√©s are there and the film, because it has been done so many times before and since then, offers few surprises. However, it is a pleasant film and it is pleasant to see. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a quieter university film, try THE FRESHMAN by Harold Lloyd - the football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is much more likable and likable than the annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college photo you can find from the time. Another reason why BROWN HARVARD is a minor picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikely and bizarre character with the same story again and again and again (as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others) - and if you ? I saw one of these films, you saw them all. Well done, but certainly NOT original! And, since it's just a remake of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is LUCKY advised to see these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and watched this little movie was the most voted movie on IMDb since 1920 !! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films: why this movie is number 1, nobody knows.
