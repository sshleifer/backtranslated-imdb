If you are under 13 or 13 and you are quite intoxicated, you will enjoy D-war. If you are a serious fan of all types of mindless action movies, you will have fun with D-war. Otherwise, don't worry! I saw the movie today with my grandchildren and 3 of their friends. They really loved him and that made me feel good. After the film was finished, all the children (my grandchildren and their friends) could not stop thanking me for bringing them to the theater. <br /> <br /> The CG is good. Acting and directing are horrible. The plot is extremely simple. But since half the audience was made up of children, they screamed, screamed and clapped whenever the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to bring your children, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much.
