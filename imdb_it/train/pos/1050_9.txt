This extraordinary documentary gives us a glimpse of the life of courageous women in the judicial system of Cameroon: police officers, lawyers and judges. Despite tremendous difficulties, lack of resources, the desperate poverty of the people, more languages ​​and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants, these brave and strong women are making a difference. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing, a truly inspiring film that restores some faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities that we see in the film, justice is served thanks to these passionate and hard-working women. I just hope this movie has a wide circulation in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
