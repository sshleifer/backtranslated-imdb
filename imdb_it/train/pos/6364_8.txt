"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all the previews meant to be. It is not often found. Most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the film is terrible. Not so with this. I was pleased with the original plot, even if the secondary plots were not. The animation was not broken as "Shrek" but it was still a good thing. The plot and plot were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them. This keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You also have to think a little, but not too much. Once you think about it, you can understand what must happen, but you don't know for sure how it will end. <br /> <br /> Even the casting was good. Michael J. Fox, as Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits well. Even the tenacious Commander Rourke was well chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", which I also liked. I really enjoyed the casting of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. His ability to interpret a senseless personality makes the film more interesting. It's just a pity she's a villain. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's worth while (8 out of 10).
