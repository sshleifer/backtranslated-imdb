It was very funny! I never read those Chester-Gould comics, but you don't need to know them. Maybe there were jokes inside that I didn't understand, but what the eye doesn't see the heart can't grieve. This is such an ironic and colorful film and the actors are in a good mood all together. The setting is similar to that in the Batman films, but not so dark and gray. Ok, the plot is not so original but there is a plot (which is not obvious in itself) and a more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> With this movie you could play an interesting game, if you watch it with friends Don't look at the credits at the beginning and then look who is the fastest to find out who the famous actors are under their makeup!
