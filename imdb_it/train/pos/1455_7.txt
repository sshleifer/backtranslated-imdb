Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that describes how two cultures have a lot in common but they are not even aware of the influence that each society has on each other. David Redmon opens your eyes and lets you see how the workers in China make beads that are cheap and sell up to $ 20 in America. When Redmon asks Americans to know where these pearls come from, they didn't have the slightest idea and they looked stupid. When he told them that they are made in China for less than nothing with a horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, hurt and a little full of remorse, but they didn't really seem like they would stop buying the beads after discovered the truth. When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they didn't know that the Americans were wearing them around their necks and paid so much for these pearls. The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind the beads and could not believe it. This film is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides ours. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
