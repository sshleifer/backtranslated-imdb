Speaking of an explosive opening, "Trampa Infernal" has the most beautiful opening titles ever! Guided by musical tones perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary theme "Friday 13" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the protagonists appear on the screen divided into giant syllables. Promising introduction of a Mexican survival thriller and totally obscure backwoods and becomes increasingly cool with every minute that passes. Two extremely competitive paintball enemies and testosterone overloads challenge each other in a showdown in an inelegant bar. According to a newspaper article, in the nearby woods there is a wild bear that has already killed many of the hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge includes whoever kills the bear will be declared the last macho hero with the largest set of balls. Upon arrival, however, it soon becomes obvious that I am not against a bear, but a completely disoriented and manic war veteran with an arsenal of weapons in his hiding place and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. After a whole decade of domesticated and derived American blades, this Mexican effort of the early 1990s seems very refreshing and vivid. The formula is simplistic but efficient, the main characters are quite plausible and the construction towards clashes with the sadistic killer is reasonably suspicious. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasantly bad and barbaric, something I really hoped for since I saw the fantastic opening sequences, and wasted a lot of free blood. The forest environment and in particular the camouflaged explosive traps are joyously spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper hit that is highly recommended to fans of the genre.
