The soldier may not have Lucas's academic acting or special effects but he certainly does it for me. I won't tell you what it is, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a great futuristic movie of action / science fiction destined to fail. Kurt Russell doesn't say much, he usually has a creepy or drone look on his face, but he fits the character. There are great action and fighting scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but the one in Hollywood makes the earth believe that we should escape our normal lives. I didn't see Soldier 2 but this is one of my favorites. I'm lucky enough to have a wife digging on the boys' movies; we both love this movie and would recommend it to everyone who loves science fiction hard movies.
