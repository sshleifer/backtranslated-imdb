IN LOVING MEMORY BY DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film, I was 4 and I was fascinated by this story of WWII witches. The scene that struck me most was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was great to see this army without a body walking to fight the amazed singing their march. This film is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which has become for me the most fantastic place in London) for the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson really are a fantastic couple. She is always great, she looks like the good aunt of a family and David, with his always-astonished face, is his great co-protagonist. we will miss him very much.
