Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) arrives unexpectedly in place of his son. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is rather surprised to know that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), left his father. Rachel's wife (Elizabeth Perkins) and her three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go to see a farm that is for sale. But it's not the end of their journey. Their journey turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the script and did an extraordinary job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is simply fantastic. And he worked with the script for twenty years so no wonder he is so handsome Who would be the best man to play Peter Falk's father? No one, I can tell. And I love the story about why Paul wanted Peter Falk to play the part. Peter was an actor who made his father laugh. And surely Peter made me laugh in this movie. It's simply hilarious when you go fishing. And as the old man beats the youngest in the pool game and then beats him with the stick. The film is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times. But it can also be moving from time to time. You can't tell a story better than you've been told here.
