You don't get darker or more tragic than "Othello" and this film captures the play quite well, with exceptional performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expresses Othello's torment to the viewer as he falls victim to Iago's lies in a very convincing way, also providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which is no reason for Iago's behavior). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. Even the characters of Cassio and Emilia wander in and out of the scenes even though, like Iago, they seem more crucial to the plot. I didn't check the movie against the game to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well. <br /> <br /> If I had some criticism of the film it would be that the story took place too quickly and that the relationships between some characters were no longer structured. The director had an exceptional cast and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassius and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona must be further developed first in the film. I have the feeling that they were closer to each other than what the film suggests, even if you understand it very late in the film. Furthermore, Otello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their distress is convincing, the amount of interaction they have between them makes it seem like they have just met. On the other hand, maybe they just met --- like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short: good performance, too short. <br /> <br />
