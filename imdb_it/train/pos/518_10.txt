Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. During the Second World War the British plane of Peter Carter (David Niven) was shot down in combat but survived. He meets and falls in love with the lovely June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake has been made in Heaven - he should have died! A French spirit comes to get him but he refuses. Soon he will invoke his case before a heavenly court that should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> It sounds ridiculous, but this is actually an incredible film. The script is good with the actors playing the roles in a completely direct way and is beautifully directed: the scenes on Earth are breathtaking in Technicolor (I've never seen such a beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in Paradise are in black and white! Niven is a little stiff at times but Hunter is simply fantastic (and very handsome) and Roger Livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help Niven. The images are incredible (especially the scale and during the final test sequence) and the special effects are really fantastic (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven comes across a completely naked boy who raises sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful and inspiring film - highly recommended. This remains unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
