'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release in 1969. There are some scenes where you can figure it out, just a little. The film on Joe Buck (Jon Voight) who comes from Texas to New York to become a hustler is sometimes a bit scary. Dressed as a cowboy, try to live like a braggart, making money with the act of love. Does not work as expected. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) gave him a shot and stole some money to become friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money. <br /> <br /> The film was probably rated as X for the main subject, but in the way we see some strange things. The editing in this film is fantastic. We see dream sequences by Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a pleasant and sometimes amusing way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and supporting actors give great shows. Above all Hoffman offers some famous famous lines. The score is made by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this a fantastic film that won the Oscar for best film for a good reason.
