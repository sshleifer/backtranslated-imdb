This must be the best adaptation I've seen is my favorite and I think it stays very close to the book. What really makes it a must see is the casting of the two main actors. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I I saw on the screen brooding and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and sweetness of Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is this, the young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in 1800 who advertises her services as a housekeeper in the newspapers. The post of housekeeper is offered at the large Thornfield Hall villa to protect Adele, the young department of mysterious and respected owner Mr. Rochester. As the months go by he falls in love with Jane and sets up some situations to try to see if Jane is so madly in love with him as he is with her. However, there is still a secret waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and when it is, the effects are devastating. It is a moving and well acted drama, with wonderful locations and costumes, more like I have said before in excellent acting, especially by Zelah and Timothy.
