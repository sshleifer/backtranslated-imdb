Read Eric's review again. He described my feeling perfectly for this film more eloquently than I ever could. I'm just writing here to encourage you further to look for it and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on TV, I believe the IFC. It is such a unique film that I have hesitated to make comparisons. It was shot in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not the Sedona-style Durango, Mexico (from the John Wayne films), but a truly wild and wild place. I have to find the novel now to verify the original position of the story. Like the position, this film is strange, wild and wonderful, strange and absolutely not suitable for everyone. It's the kind of production that motivates me almost to study cinema. <br /> <br /> I hadn't really forgotten this film, it's indelible. And yet, over the years, I had forgotten his existence. I know no one who has seen it, never read it, or seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I even forgot the title. Well, I'll try to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** From the moment I posted this post, I became a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and I regret never having read it before. <br /> <br /> Related to MsMyth's comment below; the film was shot in Mexico but the author is Colombian and did not comment in any way on the history of Mexico or Mexico, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library. Did you like the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else written by Garcia Marquz. And, by the way, the original position in history was Colombia.
