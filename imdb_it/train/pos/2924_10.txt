Nominal NR (would have been classified as R for Pervasive Strong Language and Humor Sexual Humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Score: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first comedy routine. This was released in 1983. Ripo then starred in the movie 48 hrs and Trading Places and was on Saturday Night Live. Eddie made two stand-up comedy films. Desirious and Raw. I prefer Raw because I found the topic more fun. Although it's fun, Eddie talks about his childhood and the fun of celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. Any fan of standing comedy movies should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
