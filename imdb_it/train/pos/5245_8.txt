I thought this movie was LOL funny. It's funny, don't be taken seriously, films about a man's distorted opinions on life, love and ... well, sir "from the low bus station, the high class debater ... at the bus station." Tim prati plays a boy (Leon Phelps) who grew up in a Playboy-style villa by a paternal figure of Hugh Hefner, constantly surrounded by beautiful models and porn actresses. When his "father" hunts him down the street, he must learn to look after himself with nothing but the chauvinistic vision of life that his youth taught him ... that is an unfathomable, almost mystical level of fascination and stupidity luck. And so hijinx begins! If you have not seen this movie and you have fun with a comedy or a carefree and semi-irreverent love story, I strongly recommend that you hire "The Man of Women".
