What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, expect it to be full of action. <br /> <br /> In Bruckheimer's film, Gone in 60 Seconds, it's all about nomenclature. With monikers of characters like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and idealized cars with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's just the action that never stops you from just wanting to play the game of the name. <br /> <br /> It is not a profound script in any way, but it is a great vehicle for action as Nicolas Cage in the role of Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of car theft save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the 1974 cult, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you looking not at acting. Although they are loaded with stars, none of them has exceptional performance, including a very weak performance of one of my favorite dawns, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, who won her recent Oscar win, is just a sign of love interest with very little screen time. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and car chases get involved in a great movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to watch and even if a particular scene takes you into the realm of the incredible, the action is relentless and the suspense is compelling. Pay attention to the other drivers fighting for the pole position while you exit the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
