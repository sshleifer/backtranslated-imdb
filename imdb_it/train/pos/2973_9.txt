Here is a movie that is really fun in every single moment that it covers. How can this film not be the protagonist of the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I saw this film for the first time, I didn't immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in acting and writing was pretty impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to know that they were actually Matt and Trey later. Humor is sometimes rough, sometimes bad, sometimes bright, sometimes subtle, sometimes strong and sometimes stupid, but overall, this is a hellish film that is undoubtedly underestimated. Well, actually, he's crazy. Totally crazy.
