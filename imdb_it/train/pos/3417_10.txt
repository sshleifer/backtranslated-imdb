Before seeing this, I was discouraged by the subject, but this is not your average triumph over the history of adversity. Although technically they are Tibetan blind children who climb Mount. Everest, there's so much more. This film shows the very strong and often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults who lead children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind mountaineer / athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own way, but they do not agree on what will really increase confidence in children. Erik wants them to reach the top while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a model and have fun in the moment. The nuances are complicated and one moves away without being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before finding the way to school. The most moving thing for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could see a whole movie about his life and I was happy to learn that thanks to school, he now runs a small, successful business with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you will love it.
