POSSIBLE SPOILER - Somehow "How to Alien Friends ...." is the "loser learns to adapt, becomes successful and discovers that something else matters more" kind of story, located in the celebrity business. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don't know the original book but this play offers many good moments. Although I think the finish is flawed. He looked too fast and too abrupt, like something was missing. Moreover I would say that the film is not able to maintain a high level. In addition to this you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities. Until now I had never seen Pegg differently. Yet it is a truly unique type, although on the screen it may sometimes seem a little more boring than necessary. Fox proved to be able to play a sexy actress with her head in the clouds. I don't know if it was a difficult thing to do, but his performance was very positive and better than "Transformers" (okay ... probably not a tough game). Kirsten Dunst is very Kirsten Dunst (again) and you might like (like me) or find it annoying. On the other hand you will see Anderson who demonstrated his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (who is fine but maybe could have done a little more powerful). They adapt quite well to their character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice comedy for celebrities with some more fun and less funny passages, a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending.
