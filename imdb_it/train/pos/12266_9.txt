Imagine that tonight I was going to miss this great cultural event on Swedish TV, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the TV on (to make it easier to fall asleep!) That I ran into it (yes, she had already seen an advertisement previously, but obviously she forgot about it and couldn't wait to start the "early evening" ...). <br /> <br /> However - this must surely be an unusual idea - to base a documentary film on an interview made with sound only over 30 years ago. But with the animated material and other documentary films is added a really good and insightful portrait of one of the most appreciated literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> I will certainly read my Tintin album with a different eye after watching this film, which makes it easier to connect style variations and content with different periods of Hergé's life (and I can tell you that , as soon as possible, I will get the few that I did not have). Of course my perception of the albums has changed over the past 25 years I've already read them, as well as my opinion of which albums are my favorites, but this adds (at least) one more dimension to them.
