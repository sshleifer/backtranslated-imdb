This was a wonderfully intelligent and funny film that I will never tire of watching many, many times. The casting was great at combining young people with older characters. There are those of us out there who really appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for every type of production in which she acts. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch while every transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an exceptional image for most recently made films without good characters, good scripts and good acting. The film's audience needs heroes, not deviant mannequins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I'd like to see this movie win the prizes it deserves. Thanks again for a huge night of fun. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer and all those who have done a great job.
