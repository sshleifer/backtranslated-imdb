In his first film as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell lashes out with a fascinating thread that is all that penetrates conjugal affine with melancholy authenticity and that is intertwined with an equally absorbing subframe of a father-son. The film is cunningly directed and is composed of a cast wonderfully put together and a quick and family-friendly script (also by Brommell) that gives life to an otherwise fatigued genre. As a bonus, "Panic" offers a subtle and bitter humor, an unexpected surprise, undeniably fascinating and very welcome, through its uncertain, insecure and low star, whose always fresh state is tempting, especially given its way of working. <br /> <br /> The ever-great William H. Macy resumes our hearts again as Alex, an unhappy, torn, middle-aged husband and father who find comfort in the most doubtful person: a young man of 23 , young, attractive and equally messed up, named Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom she meets in the waiting room of a psychologist's office, where she awaits the therapy of Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss her growing desire to leave the family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built. Alex, whose longing to lead a new life is hampered by the fear of disappointing his dictating father, strikes Sarah for an unfortunate fantasy, which eventually leads him to understand the essence and the irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and, above all, of him, a good father of the six-year-old son, Sammy (played with enthusiasm by the sympathetic David Dorfman). Henry Brommell's brilliant "Panic" is a rareness in Hollywood rarely seen (with the exception of the "Road to Perdition" of 2002, since its conception in 2000, intertwines two contrasting genres (organized crime, family drama) in a fascinating A warm piece of vision of the film that is uniformly strong in both directions is one that will maintain its exceptional, infrequent caliber and sparkling sincerity for centuries to come.
