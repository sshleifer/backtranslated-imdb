<br /> <br /> Ok, the film would not have won any awards and is pure bubblegum, and is a modern update on "It's a wonderful life". But it has just come out as a cheap version on DVD and there are much worse ways to blow $ 13. You have a film that has a surprisingly strong cast, but for the most part it was still a year or two to become celebrity on the B list. it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half just don't think about it too much.
