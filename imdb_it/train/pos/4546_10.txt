This film will go down in history as one of the great, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comic duo, whose talent has never been seen after Abbot and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you the creeps. The character of Dingman as the funny sandwich is aimed at the times of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. My God, the climax. I won't ruin it for you, but it makes the explosion of the Death Star pale in comparison. If you can track down this hard to find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I'm still giving hope for a special edition DVD one of these days.
