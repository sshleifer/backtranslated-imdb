First let's take a few things: zombies don't exist, so the director can have WALK, RUN, hell even FLY if he wishes. This is what makes this original Zombie movie so good. All they did was so damn original. I hate when directors do everything like Romero or when fan fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should growl like a typical Romero movie, once again zombies don't exist, so a filmmaker can whistle zombies if he wishes. The zombies of this film all look very good, but OBVIOUSLY they are not rotting corpses since they died! They are rather messy and full of blood and chopped faces. One of the most beautiful scenes was a half-eaten cat. It seemed really damn true, my daughter cried when she saw it. This film had great reviews on Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so I decided to go see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the tastes of true horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go get it!
