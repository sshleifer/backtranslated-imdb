Help if you understand Czech and you can see it in the original language and understand the Czechs' obsession with "The Professionals", but if not, "Jedna ruka netlaska" is another great Czech film. It's fun, dark and extremely fun. The biggest compliment I can pay is that you never know what will happen next and that it is well maintained even in the second and third vision. <br /> <br /> For a small country the Czech Republic has produced an incredible amount of world-class films and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor by its nature is obscure and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This film is just that, it is rude and takes care of the less lovable sides of human beings, but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this and most of the other projects in which Trojan and Machacek are involved. Have fun, it's a movie made for this very reason - anyway, it's so close as the Czechs will never come to write a happy ending ...
