Well, personally I don't like rap, but I found the hilarious Fear of a Black Hat. I'm sure I didn't make fun of it, but some I knew, and it was fun enough to make me laugh right after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap, so of course I had to check it out. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this film still held up as an original, intelligent and amusing satire. My favorite: "In the time of the slaves, they had no hats to protect them from the sun, so by the end of the day they were too tired to rebel. Now we have hats."
