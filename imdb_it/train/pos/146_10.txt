I reached the end of this and I was almost screaming "No, no, no, NO! It can't end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The commitment of the dishwasher? The disappearance of Mona? The superiority of Helmer? The" zombie "? Little Brother saved by his father? And what about the head ???????" ARGH !! Then I read that at least two cast members had passed and I have to say, I know it probably wouldn't be true for the vision of Lars von Trier, but I would gladly watch the replacement actors just to see the final he had planned! Of course, it would be difficult to find someone who plays Helmer as the character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I haven't seen a more self-absorbed, unaware and hypocritical character on the screen yet! But I could overlook a change in the actors ... I just need to know how it ends!
