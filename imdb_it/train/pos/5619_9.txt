I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty-dollar noise violation to sneeze after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily connect to " The Tenant "by Polanski. <br /> <br /> But I also like the film for other reasons. I'm not sure it works, on the whole, the descent of Polanski's character in paranoia and madness, which lasts about half an hour, seems rather boring and bizarre. Ebert, for example, was not entirely convinced, and he slapped the film with a vicious one-star review. But I think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even if I don't completely understand the whole film - what does Egyptology have to do with, for example? - I still have a positive overall impression. <br /> <br /> I love the hateful friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times have I been content to have stupid friends like this instead of not having friends! I love the cinema scene - I would say the funniest moment of "making out" in the history of cinema. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so fickle in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. And it gives a great performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I disagree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here. His character should be low-key and thoughtful, so his low-key performance fits. I, for example, found him perfectly sympathetic - even though he lost me a little when he started dressing enthrallingly for no clearly discernible reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is dark. Is slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living - something I've done too much - so I'm digging it. It's funny how all you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly a strange film like this becomes profoundly significant! Definitely worth collecting for the change of pocket on DVD.
