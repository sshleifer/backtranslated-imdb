This film was great and I'd like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to capture a young eagle. the boy has to feed himself and take care of the eagle until it is big enough to be sacrificed for crops. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and escapes from the tribe. The eagle helps him to catch it by catching a duck from a small pond that the boy scares. Later the boy shoots at a deer that a bully boy claimed because their arrows were marked very close in the same way. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually took the deer. But this was unfortunate because he made the other boys even more cruel to him, and in the end he was chased on a cliff but when you think he will fall from his pure love for the eagle he will turn him into a golden eagle with just a necklace like reminder of who he was. Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I haven't seen him for over 30 years, but I still remember parts of the film.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
