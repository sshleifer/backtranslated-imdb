Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like Rambo in outer space with monstrous special effects (often ridiculous like the sounds of explosions in the emptiness of space). Although tamed by today's standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" were quite surprising for their time. Even today they are still plausible. Still, the best part of the film is perhaps the reason why radio thrillers continue to attract. Much of what was happening was left to the imagination of the public. (What did the Krell creatures look like?) Having most of the story of the story never divulged or disclosed only at the end, the tension and suspense remained throughout the film. The ending was also very stimulating and satisfying. In my mind, this is still one of the best (if not the best) science fiction films ever made.
