during the pose of Eddie Murphy, a woman from the audience screams at Eddie and a man from the audience answers. what is being said is "the women - DO the MR ROB (this is a character from the Saturday night live), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. unlike the previous post that said that women screamed to make gumby, this does not is correct, even if the post-er said it was there that they must have a hearing problem! despite what the post-er says it is not able to do it here on DVD, listen to it up close how you can actually hear it on the DVD - MAKE MISS ROB !!!! I hope this helps someone to pry out of the explosion cheers gaz !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!
