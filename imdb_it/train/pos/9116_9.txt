The idea is a very intelligent title that the film has a brazen irony. But it's so subtle that you don't know how to read it! These guys are doing a full-blown comedy or there's something else to do. The little dialogue that the film has is not very delicate and this increases the power of the film. If all the sound were turned off by the movie, it really wouldn't take anything away from the movie. The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it alone brings the entirety of the story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame. First I say this film as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the film I was so impressed with the work. But then I asked myself what will happen? Where can someone else see this work? The common association of art without purpose is not found here. You can see the intention in the drawing from beginning to end. The use of African music in the style of casting seems all planned and for a reason. The character development is surprising. I think the casting is the strongest aspect of the film; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of real movies. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these types of films, we need more support for the development of short films through board.
