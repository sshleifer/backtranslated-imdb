Yes, it's a stupid movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget it ... but, if you love John Candy's humor, this is a must see. We lost John Candy before he did enough of his great comedy brand, and he's just better in a movie: Planes, Trains, & Automobiles (with Steve Martin). Excellent support performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work ever as the hot-headed Sal DiPasquale. The acting of Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle is also good. You must see this dark and out of print movie if you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
