I love this film, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... almost everything has already been said about the film, but there is a detail I would like to shed light on: no footage of truth, still standing, Hôtel du Nord (it is still "I heard it had to be demolished ...) was used for the film - the whole scene was rebuilt on the set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks.
