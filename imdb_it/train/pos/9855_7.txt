This is my first CG animation film I've ever seen. Usually, the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them. Not the ice age. I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> The Ice Age was sporadically fun and a fun movie to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years ago. The images were fantastic. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create a convincing investigation, another thing is to create visually interesting things and Ice Age is nice to look at with its stylized images. Blue Sky Studios is a company to watch out for in the future.
