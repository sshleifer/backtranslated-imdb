I'm surprised that many viewers have more respect for the sequel to this fantastic movie ... I've seen all the guinea pigs and this is easily the best. <br /> <br /> Although I saw the "making of" ", I still have doubts when I look at those 35 minutes of pure torture: it's so powerful. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 because this film has perfectly achieved what it set out to do: to be the best fake movie ever made.
