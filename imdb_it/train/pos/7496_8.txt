<br /> <br /> I am upset with the comments of the other reviewer for the simple reason that it is a movie of MYSTERY, not a supernatural one! It is not the only film to have an apparently "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be very trivial. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to mind are "Before Dawn of Edgar Wallace". "and the (most famous)" Mark of the Vampire ". <br /> <br /> The film does a WONDERFUL job in creating a very" ghostly "atmosphere, similar to DRACULA, when Renfield meets the Count on the stairs of his castle, or in MARS OF THE VAMPIRE, when the two people look through the windows of the castle ruins and see a "corpse" playing an organ, while Luna goes down using her wings! VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If you like them these atmospheric touches (often silent), THIS film is a MUST! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
