This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because he is not afraid to investigate some politically incorrect topics (such as the spanking and female submission) that other mainstream films are too shy to be touched. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the plot without bothering to offend the viewer. However, I don't think anything has been done here just to be disconcerting or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns into an excellent and courageous performance. The most established mainstream actresses would not have assumed this role or would have required some important modifications to the scripts before accepting it. The other cast members also do a great job. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that this film has not appeared on the pay cable since a short mandatory period was performed after a year in theaters? have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it does not fit into today's political atmosphere. It seems to me quite ironic that some premium channels now bring softcore porn (which is getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not contain a mainstream film like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, although this film is only 11 years old, it probably could not be realized today. <br /> <br />
