Surely among the top five of John Garfield's best films must be Pride of the Marines. It is the true story of Al Schmid, a private individual from the Marines who, at the cost of his own sight, while he was wounded, kept a horde of Japanese in storm at Guadalcanal at bay. <br /> <br /> The story is well divided into three parts: the domestic life of Al Schmid, in which he works as a simple stifo who is becoming serious with a woman and who loves nothing better than his bowling night . Pearl Harbor is bombed and he is at war as were millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where it is in an isolated machine gun nest, keeping the Japanese troops at bay. His action prevented the positions of the Marines being swept away, but a grenade is in his sight. <br /> <br /> And of course the third part is his painful adaptation to civil life and to reassure himself that people do not care only for him out of pity, especially for that girl who was seeing Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was broadcast on TCM for John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the most credible actor in working class roles in having and holding a union card. <br /> <br /> In this respect he was lucky that he landed with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to be a printer in the gangster roles in the tradition of that studio, Garfield was exceptional in these parts because of his background, because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had, with the exception of Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In this respect he was perfect for playing the part of a working class hero like Al Schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. There are no super heroes here, just a guy who would rather go back to Philadelphia, but do a job that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a big role for Garfield. It's a film not to be missed. But I wonder what happened to the real Al Schmid.
