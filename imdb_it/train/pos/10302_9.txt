This film is the best film that Jim Carrey has ever made. Carrey didn't have his usual face doing things in this movie. It was both funny and sad. Carrey starred in a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything wrong with his life. Therefore, God descends from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey did a great job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great actors and non-leading actresses. The plot was good because it had many secondary points at the main point. This film can be fun (Bruce's dog) and also sad (the "break"). The script also worked well. I'm glad they followed up on this movie. I consider this film a 9/10.
