I swear, the zombie has been killed twice, and has kept coming back. I gave this film an 8. Let's face it, folks, this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying, a "handy-cam" movie. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the total production of independent films. The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this film is a tribute to his talent. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we always see the same zombies, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a funny and bloody horror movie, one to share with your friends, or to record the people you really care about. Mellow out people, I suppose you all like pieces of garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister". Peace and support for the production of independent films !!!
