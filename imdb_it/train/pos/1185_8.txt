Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change roles from good guys in "All the brothers were brave". Taylor looks a little uncomfortable in his bad boy role, but Granger plays his part perfectly. However, the true hero of history is the bison and the northwest. The film is made perfectly, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. The direction is tense and even if the film is not a carefree fun it is, for my way of thinking, an important film, unjustly ignored by cognoscenti.
