John Waters gave us a really nice movie. This is certainly not without its shocking Waters-esque moments, but it is more gentle than its old culinary things, like "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" draws attention to John's main stage as he reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in "Polyester". Overall, a very funny comedy with some fantastic moments!
