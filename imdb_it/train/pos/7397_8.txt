"Xizao" is the story of the clash between modern life and ancient traditions and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) died. He believes his father is still alive, as is his old neighborhood and his father's old business, the public bath. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the family of Da Ming and how he must learn the importance of his father's work, something he had always considered an old tradition that had to die soon. Furthermore, the film explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well managed, and the film never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very well developed and we can take a look at Chinese society and customs. <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way, letting the character characters do their job. It's a very simple approach, but it fits the film perfectly, and I strongly doubt that another style fits the film so well. Zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the help of visual flashes or visual tricks. <br /> <br /> The acting is exceptional in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost seems like they were real people who were filmed. The three protagonists give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming certainly steals the show. <br /> <br /> Even if the film could have been attached to a message "old times was much better", instead it takes an attitude of balance, like saying that progress is good, and we have to move on, but not we must forget where we come from, and maintain a balance between modern life and the traditions of the past. <br /> <br /> A fantastic and touching movie. 8/10
