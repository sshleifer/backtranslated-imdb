I almost didn't rent it because of all the negative comments, but it did anyway. I thought it was similar to the darkness that I also liked. The only part I hated about the ferry was the two red-necked brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but this was not a comedy. It ruined the film a bit for me because it wasn't necessary. The rest of the film was the way it should be a horror or suspense movie. The trick was good and I saw much worse movies than this. It was a simple story with credible acting. It is not the scariest or most glorious movie, but I didn't show up or wanted a refund after seeing it. On the DVD there were previews of other films that all look good and will check them.
