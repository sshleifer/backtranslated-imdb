OK, normally I wouldn't watch a Farrelly brothers movie. I don't remember ever seeing one. I also don't remember seeing a Jimmy Fallon movie. All right, I looked at the taxi, but I said penitence and I was forgiven for that mistake. But, this movie has had Drew Barrymore and I think it's the nicest thing. I don't know what it is about her, but I only smile for as long as I watch her. It fascinates me in this way. I mean, I even saw Adam Sandler to see her in 50 First Dates. How sad is it? This wasn't the biggest baseball movie - it didn't have to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy who clung to the one thing that never disappointed him until he found something that was worth giving up. It had a predictable ending, but there was so much to do that it was worth it.
