This film was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Pleasant and direct writing, which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at the daily life of Ruby. What we see is a slice of the life of the young Ruby woman. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for best female lead in this role. Ruby is starting to live alone and has established her identity. Explore jobs, friendships, friends, sex, a typical search for young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As a fan of independent cinema, I chose the film because of Sundance. I appreciate this kind of film because it doesn't carry Hollywood's luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool, with Paul Newman. The next film is a part of the everyday life of a common man. I like it. The story is told very well, and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure of is the title. I'm sure there are not so many insects and flies in paradise as in Florida. Since I am allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, it itches all thinking of Florida. I turn into a completely red bubbling. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking on the beach of Panama City, Florida. In fact the sand is very white. I have been there. Favorite quotes: "Necessity has always been a good excuse". "All this agitation in finding a man is no different now, who will be, when and why." <br /> <br />
