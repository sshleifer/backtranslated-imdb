This is definitely one of my favorite Trek fav episodes. There is so much to do in this movie that it's crazy. First the boys throw themselves into an alien planet that is about to explode. They meet a strange type of librarian (very well played). Then Kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very similar to the 16th century earth. McCoy and Spock try to follow him, but instead almost freeze the frozen version of the 100,000-year-old alien world to death. Kirk manages to get himself locked up and accused of witchcraft while Spock has a little fun with a sexy cavegirl who has been defeated in this frozen and horrible world by a bad boy. <br /> <br /> Spock decides to be happy where hes and gives McCoy a real assent to whuppin 'when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. However, in the end everyone runs away, leaving the poor cavirl behind. It takes a lot of convictions before Spock finally gives up and leaves. In the end you can literally taste the sadness. Leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen desert just seems cruel and it's really moving. Spock must have been out of his volcano mind to leave behind his greatest hope of love and of being human. Although, in a neighborhood not so beautiful! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you get so much for your lot with this episode .... A love story, Salem's witch trials, Spock as a human, the desperation to be left in total isolation ... abandoned and three completely different settings on the alien planet. It's amazing they managed to put it all into a fifty-minute movie. This is a classic, not to be missed .... I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
