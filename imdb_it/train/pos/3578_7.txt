Twelve-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family cannot interact with him (or feel that it is not the right thing to do). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the ONLY one who seems to have compassion on him. Realism will captivate lovers of the "true-2-life" film, but will not satisfy those who want action and thrills.
