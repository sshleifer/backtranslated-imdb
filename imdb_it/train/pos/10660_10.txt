I found this film full of suspense almost from the beginning. When Miss Stanwyck starts her story, it only takes a few minutes to figure out that the problem is coming. The deserted area, the lock on the door of the deserted gas station, everything prepares you to wait ... here it comes. At first you think it's about the child, but too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in. I found this film really stressful, even though I had seen it before and was ready for the epilogue. Now a film that can make you remain in suspense even when you've seen it before deserves a sort of special evaluation, maybe a prize with white knuckles?
