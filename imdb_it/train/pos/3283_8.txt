As a lover of the surreal (in art and cinema) I was happy to discover this film on IFC. He is definitely a goalkeeper. Most of the other reviews say the general plot (not all correct) so I won't worry about boring anyone with that. The main thing is the concept of alternative worlds caused by Ana's impending illness, and the way she manages to connect with someone else after being so "alone", and finally with her family, which I think is still at least a little bit upset. You can call it a horror movie just because it has scary scenes but it's a fantasy (with a little hint of "coming of age" just because Ana is a pre-teenager who "hates kids"). I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the trait of their imagination.
