IMDb lists it as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68. No matter, apart from the fact that it is rather interesting to see this abstract collage of films and videos (one of the first works of art to unite the two apparently) in the context of the 2001 Star Gate sequence, published the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super-saturated colors optically printed and the psychedelic sensation of this series of flowers, of Rohrschach machines, of birds, etc. It is quite compelling and very beautiful. It certainly helped pave the way for many other video artists born in the 1970s, and deserves to be better known.
