I know that technically this is not the biggest TV show of all time, I mean it was shot on video and its limitations show both the audio and visual aspects of it. Acting can also be a bit crumby.ma, I love this shows so much. It scared me to death when it first aired in 1988. of course I would have been 5 years old. but recently I bought the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I heard was deleted. I also heard that Warner's will never be released due to the bad sales of the first DVD. Even the TV show didn't have the same feeling as the movies, in fact I thought it had a more sinister tone. Although the color palette is similar to the nightmare on elm street 4 (both that movie and the TV show were made the same year), this one has a more serious tone as the fims were gradually becoming more and more sardonic and playful. It's not a bad thing, I like freddy like the wise clown cracker. But I think it was the strength of this TV show, you didn't have freddy popping up every minute. Miss a joke before and after he kills someone. In fact this has more of a dream, reinforced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if it is deliberate by the creators of the show or only to the limits of being filmed on video. I love this show, and not taken as a backing piece to the movies can be a lot of fun. Much better than anything else on TV today.
