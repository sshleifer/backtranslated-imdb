I don't think a film like this would be released today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But what does this film have: an interesting study of how families deal with pain. Like when the language for healing and the tremendous loss above us leaves us dumb, and instead we rely on raw emotions. Pain without reason and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while he is hunting) is given more than his good part of it in the film. Eventually he leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) which tells him that it was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but he needed to listen to those words of his parents, and to receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved about this film: the lack of dialogue. There was a huge emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film lets you really watch the actors' reactions. Something we can't do much with today's films. <br /> <br />
