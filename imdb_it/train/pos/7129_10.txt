This film was on my wish list for ten years and I found it only recently on DVD when my partner's nephew gave him. He looked at him and was thrilled to learn that it concerned my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and that he wanted to learn more - and me. Fortunately, I borrowed it from him and watched it myself and cried everything. Not only did he capture the emotions, the class distinction, the difficulties and the warmth of the human relationships of those years (as well as the cruelties (spoken and unspoken), but it was accurate! They are also a bit of an anorak when he arrives at the ARP uniforms, at the ambulances (LCC) in the right color (white) and at all the impediments of the management of the bomb sites and of the work of the heavy rescue Brigades I could not criticize any of this from my memories, and the sack of sand Anderson's shelter and WVS canteens brought it all back in. The difference between relatively unspoiled life in the village and war-torn London was also sharply presented, I relived 1939/40 and my evacuation from London with this production! Gold's work, of course, and you would no longer expect this meticulous detail from him, but went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep agreements on human responses and the only value judgments issued in the middle of those years. he was certainly in one of the great highlights of John Thaw's acting career and of Gold's management and deserves to be better known. It's a great film and I've already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.
