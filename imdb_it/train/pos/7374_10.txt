For his first ever debut, this film has some compelling and chilling moments. In the best fashion of the horror film, the pit of the stomach tightens every moment during this film. The finish is superb. The producers of Blaire Witch have obviously watched this film that is ending was not the end but a beginning of the end. A great movie and just a piece of Japan's big scare factor, a perfect score that makes you think and startled by your mind.
