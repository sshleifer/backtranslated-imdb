A Disney movie that dares to do something different should be rewarded for the effort. "Fori" doesn't make the same mistakes you'd expect from a Disney movie about troubled teens put in a field. For the first time the events are not explained in detail. The flashback scenes really serve a purpose and present several mature topics that can surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a little discouraged by the seriousness of the film. But I soon realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to history, this film also does a good job questioning some methods used in correctional structures. (An example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes to build a character, as learning to read will not contribute to this). "Fori" is a film that is intelligent and beautiful. A must watch!
