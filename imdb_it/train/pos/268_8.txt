I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is it spelled correctly?) In Cybil. I didn't see her for a while and I forgot how much I missed her. I thought you did a great job at this. The supporting cast was also quite good. In some places the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The abductor was rather terrifying and the story in general had some twists and turns. The young boy was a hottie. I thought the husband certainly had something to do with this. <br /> <br /> I've just received the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I'm loving these movies. I kept my interest and will look at it again when they do it again. Can anyone else recommend movies like this? You can post on the bulletin board or send me a private email if you want. Thanks in advance. Aboutagirly.
