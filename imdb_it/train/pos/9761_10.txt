Now here's a movie from my childhood, my family used to record; but it has been exploited and lost over the years. Now I was lucky enough to see the whole movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful film when I saw it as a child, and after seeing it again (online), I still do it today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (who animated who), that some of the animators date back to the 1930s (WOW! It's like 47 years).
