I was just a little young for this, but I had to see it. There is excellent music, which many have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance of "Angel", a musical dress now mostly ignored, but a rather popular time. Wearing their branded white clothes, they grind through "20th Century Foxes", and apparently everyone tries to fit into the camera's field of vision. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains the highlight of the band and, apparently, he never got a haircut, ever! Cherie Currie (former lead singer of the Runaways) begins a short but remarkable career as an actor here, and is quite memorable alongside Jodie Foster, and the rest. (His topless 3-D scenes in "Parasite" and his UFO sighting in "Wavelength" kept us all looking at it for a while). <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece, but retains a piece of its period, so that everyone can contemplate it and marvel.
