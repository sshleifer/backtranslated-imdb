An unusual film by Ringo Lam and an oddly underrated one. The mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears that are guided through the bodies is amazing, especially during the first ten minutes. A horseman on horseback is cut in two and the waist and legs continue to ride. Many horses are torn to pieces. It is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazy general maniac and imprisoned in the temple of the Red Lotus which seems to be more a torture chamber than a temple. The General bears a resemblance to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he makes deformed philosophy gush out and makes paintings with human blood scary. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the setting is drab. Blood is everywhere The action is very well done and mostly consistent unlike many HK action scenes of the time. Sometimes the movie turns absurd or the effects are in bad taste, but it's never bad enough to ruin the film. <br /> <br /> Find this, it's one of the best HK kung fu movies of the early nineties. Just remember that it is not suitable for children.
