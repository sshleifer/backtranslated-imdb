This film has pushed me beyond understanding, it is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mainly because it has almost all the emotions rolled in its 157 minutes. The hardest part to accept is that every time I want to listen to the music and the incredible songs in the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player, so I was wondering if someone somewhere knows who sings the songs in the movie and where they can be found, as I have looked everywhere I can think sporadically for the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the film is when the lawyer says in court "But do your own words ask for a direct confrontation, isn't it a direct appeal to violence?" Biko replies "Well, you and I are in a fight now, but I don't see violence !!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
