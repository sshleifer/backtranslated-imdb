I really think I should do my case and make sure that every movie fan (horror and cult) goes to see this movie ... <br /> <br /> I did it! <br /> <br /> It-is-excellent: very suggestive, disturbing and scary ... <br /> <br /> Amazing how they could make this jewel a movie with the minimum (read- "no"!) - budgets they had .... <br /> <br /> Synopsis taken from the site: "One morning, an old man wanders in the woods in search of his runaway cat, instead he finds a child without parents and a murder without a corpse ..." <br /> < br /> On this site (IMDb) there is no trailer, but I will leave a link here at the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer that is quite upsetting so please go take a look. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
