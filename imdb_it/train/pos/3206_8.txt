I really enjoyed this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting the moments speak for themselves. He must not verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and acts. He is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and is able to show us a more human side of the soldiers without being too brave.
