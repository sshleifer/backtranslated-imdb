Never having seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this film on a clean slate. And I must say that I liked it very much. Of course, some of Sondre Locke's acting made me a little snobbish - but, hey, it was the 80s. But even if you can't get past his (and I almost can't) or his vengeful killings (which seemed a bit exaggerated; P), it's only worth it for Dirty Harry. Or at least, the bull he affectionately calls "MeatHead": P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
