Standard tale of fame that has some highlights. Number one, Lonette McKee as a sister who offers stellar and extraordinary performances. The fact that it never became a great sensation after this is beyond me. Unfortunately, she is a supportive character and we are forced to focus on the bland character of Irena Carter, Sparkle, whose rise to fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, whenever the girls go on stage and perform, the film comes back to life. Curis Mayfield's original music must be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The image quality was quite low, as well as the production values ​​I would guess. All in all, it's worth it.
