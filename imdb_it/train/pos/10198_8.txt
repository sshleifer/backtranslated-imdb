I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew for reviving the once-dying undersider's Visayan movie. "Panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a revival in this vernacular (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details accurately recall this region of the Philippines. Negative side: the chopped and pompous action of the American antagonist. The other object that I didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the costume of the "period" of the same character and, above all, his bright red racing car that I suppose was destined to pass for a roadster of the '30s. Without those small but glaring details, "Panaghoy" would have been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: this film certainly beats "Oro, Plata, Mata" by Peque Gallaga, who provided a different view of the Visayas during the Second World War. Alo, there are some parts where the cinematography refers to "The Color Purple" by Spielberg and the plot begins to become reminiscent of "Noli Me Tangere".
