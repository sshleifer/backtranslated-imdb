I saw this short on a DVD of the best shorts in New Zealand, all great, but The French Doors was great. Start off slow and wonder if something will happen. Just as you relax in the buzz of home renovation, the most ghostly thing happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop looking, but I was glued. <br /> <br /> The films immerse themselves in the primordial fear of the dark and with few, if not some, special effects. You shiver to the bone. A simple but ingenious concept has opened all those memories of when I was young and dreams of the most unlikely but disturbing situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of film producers is perfect and the main character convincingly takes you through history. It's a quality short that I haven't seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The French doors have all the features of a great functionality, unfortunately it ends after about ten minutes. Never the less a great ending that asks you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> I liked it very much and well done and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders are really revealing the talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
