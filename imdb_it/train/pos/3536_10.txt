EA has shown us that they can create a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the world of the 60s. The game's graphics are exceptional and the voice recording is also very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after it was released), and I'm still impressed with the gameplay. It is a pity that EA will no longer play 007 games. I give this 10/10 game for the levels it contains, especially for the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game to anyone at least 13 years old. The only thing I didn't like in the game is the level of the Russian boat, it was too much pressure. Overall I like the game A LOT !!
