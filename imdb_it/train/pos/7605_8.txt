Lost is an extremely well done television series about some people who get lost on an island. there are so many turns that you can't really decide who your favorite character is, he's a minute, then he does something, so it's cooler, so you're going to do something, so it's cooler then the suspense builds up and just accumulates like you to blow up the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode but it's worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humor, it has everything apart from topless girls but this is nice because it means you can focus more on the story and the story is what it is about. so if you like a good story and you like suspense, this is a good choice, but I think it's probably better (I have a review on this too, you could check it out). I'd give a good 8 out of 10 because it's so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
