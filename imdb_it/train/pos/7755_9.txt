"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible and wonderfully extravagant film, as only the director Sirk could have done. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramas and colored contrasts. The connection between financial success and moral decadence is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to see the film as a prime example of what Sirk could do with kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. Even the acting in the film is fantastic. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting actress), which manages to keep the film boiling . Congratulations on the soundtrack by Frank Skinner, the brilliant photographic work by Russell Metty (every single shot is a masterpiece in itself) and the production design department. Furthermore, the melody of the title is a beauty. It is an unforgettable film.
