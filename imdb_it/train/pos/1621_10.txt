Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The consummate skill and artistic ability that characterize this duet work is nowhere more evident than in this cartoon. It is a pity that so many people can only see offense in what is, and has always been intended, a piece of light entertainment that has not at all sought to denigrate blacks. If anything, it is a tribute to the infected humor and the musicality of the black race. I have not been able to see this package for many years, as the "race commissioners" in England have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multiracial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I'd love to see this masterpiece again. I think that those who usually look for messages and intentions that have never been conceived in these cartoons, which are, after all, sixty years, should try to illuminate and remember that the world is a very different place today, but this does not mean that someone has the right to censor what is visible from the past.
