This film was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation for us. We actually thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple who ever married and had children. Obviously we were wrong. Love can come from where you don't expect it and maybe you don't want it. But we both chose that love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, it has never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of thing is for Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young we both had business, but never with the opposite sex. As we grew older we stopped having extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not unlikely. However, the suggestion of becoming heterosexual seems to me quite unrealistic. My wife and I have been sleeping together for 40 years. We're still gay. End of the story.
