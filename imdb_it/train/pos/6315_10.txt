Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it is none of the following: <br /> <br /> A stellar vehicle by George Clooney Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know, the base for the film it is another film. But as for Hollywood, this decade could be classified with their most authentic releases - and for me it is. <br /> <br /> The film is from beginning to end, a real gas. Here because. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the film. Fun parts are fun. The angular parts are angular. The script contains, not a boring moment of dialogue. Cinematography is fresh and so beautiful. And it doesn't conform to the Hollywood standard (you'll see what I mean when you see the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a child, I remember seeing the commercials for the movie. This film went under the radar after not having grossed much at the box office, nor is it a cult classic. The reason Transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by average movie goers is because they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the film is as original and fun as this one has been pumped out over millions of pieces of s ** t, the cinematic experience would be a much cooler place - <br /> <br /> When "they" say they don't act like they used to, they "didn't" see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of the caper comedy, which refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
