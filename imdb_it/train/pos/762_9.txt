I like watching people do breakdancing, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie that takes you to a nightclub called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because an "MC Santa Claus" also appears. <br /> <br /> Although this is an old movie, and even though I filmed it from TV, when the Finnish State Film Archive showed this in the summer of 2004 on their big screen, I went there to take a look. It's much more fun on the big screen than on TV. <br /> <br /> Although many people here think that watching this on the big screen is a waste of money for the cost of the ticket, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I have got the money, since it is on the big screen, especially sitting in the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than a simple video.
