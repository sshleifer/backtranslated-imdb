Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which makes you smile every time you look at it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. It is characteristic for Serbia. And the whole former Republic of Yugoslavia knows this very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can't appreciate it so much. Because the subtitles ruin the hole thing. But they should at least try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best film in Serbian history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have the chance to see this, don't blow OK!
