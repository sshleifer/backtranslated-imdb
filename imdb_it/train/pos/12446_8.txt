Having already heard of Modesty Blaise, but having never read a novel or comic book, my wife and I really enjoyed the film. It has provided, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and his background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some action flick elements, it is much more an intimate game, written in an excellent way. Unfortunately, this is also where a major drawback of the film is revealed. An intimate game lives on the abilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered. While Alexandra Staden did a great job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - like the bad Miklos - did not do it. Smiling through the plot as if it were a toothpaste advertisement, he can't create an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the film a masterpiece. The supporting cast is somewhat similar, from some stereotypical and slutty gangsters to the decent performances of Fred Pearson such as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
