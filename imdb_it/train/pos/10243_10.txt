it's great, I loved it because I love dinosaurs, they're the biggest animals, but I loved the show because it wasn't copied from another show and it was an original that has a good and great storyline for young children (if they like ie dinosaurs) I have some down even its not the big cause the dinosaurs seem a little mutated so I should have had a 7 but now it's a bit late for that yay 4 other lines to go is fantastic for a fantasy show though warning that this could ruin a part for you so if you don't want it ruined don't read about plz near the end it's a bit weird because all they have to do is get dang I forgot what was so nvm I guess it's not a spoiler, so it doesn't matter what I liked and my opinion and I'm sorry for any missed spelling words, if any
