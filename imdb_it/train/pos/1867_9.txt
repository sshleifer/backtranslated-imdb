this is a film about life, the triumph of adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I challenge anyone not to shed tears at the end of the film. This is more than just a tear-jerker, it's an engaging and challenging drama, with excellent performances by the entire cast, but especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. Seven years later, I'm amazed that Luke is still a virtual stranger and Washington has only directed another film. However, apart from a slow accumulation, the story of the trials and tribulations of this adopted child and how it still affects him in adulthood is the kind of film that stays with you long after seeing it. Like many fox searchlight images, this has been more of a sleep success and has not gained the mass acceptance of the criticism it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally met his mother summed up the film for me, there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but Washington hit exactly the right tone, his mother he never said a word and could only shed a tear, while Antowne simply asked why. Her overwhelming sense of guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving film scenes I've seen.
