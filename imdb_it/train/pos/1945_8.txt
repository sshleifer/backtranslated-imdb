This final episode of Voyager begins 23 years in the future. Voyager is back home. In the many years needed to turn back, the mind of the Vulcan Tuvok has been destroyed. He had an illness in which it was too late to go home to cure. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway meets the aliens who have the technology of time travel. He realizes that there is a Warp conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could immediately bring Voyager home - if he could go back in time and inform Voyager. There is a problem The Condotto is deep within the Borg Space. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. He's like a child. He scribbles, obsesses, works on math problems or movie reviews or something, he believes they are important in some way. In the institution, Tuvok cries, asking "Janeway" please, please come back to him. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to seize a federation shuttle and equip it with weapon technology 20 years before the Borg, in hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to drive Voyager to the Warp Conduit. <br /> <br /> When she goes back in time and connects with Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree, discussing the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok asking if it is true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits that it is true, but cannot be taken care of by the structures on the ship, so he kept everything to himself. <br /> <br /> The young captain accepts the plan of the old captains. To increase their chances of success, the older Janeway plans to distract the Borg with her shuttle. The Borg actually capture Janeway and her shuttle. Queen Borg personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected this! Queen Borg has assimilated a virus in itself that kills her. With the Borg Queen the dead Voyager passes through the Warp Conduit to the federation space.
