I read Nancy Drew as a preteen and collect books when I grow up. I loved the effect used at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the film in which line drawings in the style of books turned into scenes from the film. It was an accurate way to highlight the connections between film and book situations. For example, the scenes with the Oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of the scenarios I remember from books. I thought Ned was a perfect cast, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Just like the image of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
