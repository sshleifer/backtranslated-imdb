According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It is rather difficult to take these Mats Helge films seriously because most of his films are shot on a very tight budget. Almost no USD. But it is fascinating to establish that Mats Helge eventually completes something that can be called an action movie. The Ninja Mission is - I think - the best of all the movies he directed. Some special effects are quite fun. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. It's a "Z" movie - but a fun and entertaining "Z" movie!
