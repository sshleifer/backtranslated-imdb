If you have any clues about the production of Jane Austen, now repeat the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made with his novels are a bit boring, but I like the characters of Austen, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat also in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her starring role. Moreover, the fact that each of the characters in the film does not seem able to think anything, but how to get a good partner and soon get married, makes the film hilarious.
