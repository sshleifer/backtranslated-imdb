When you see this movie, you have to be careful that it is not a normal film. Only characters, a group of gangster characters who come together in perfect harmony, have no real story. The dialogue is wonderful, you can simply relax and listen. The film stands out for this it is difficult to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why users' comments on this film are so mixed. <br /> <br /> I for one loves the movie and I recommend it to everyone who loves jokes and things that differ from the "normal". You can't really put your finger on what's wonderful in this it's just a comic world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
