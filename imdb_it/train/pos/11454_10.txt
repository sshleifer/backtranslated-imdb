Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while now and owning some of his books, I had expectations about what I would see. What I got was something completely satisfying, and a little more than I expected. Being an artist myself (working in clay), finding inspiration within what surrounds us to make art is imperative, and it's something Andy Goldsworthy has learned. Following him over the course of a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, the skill and devotion for the artist's bond with nature with a drastic and stimulating touch. The music set for the film is enveloping and intoxicating. If you are an artist in need of inspiration or anyone else needs an exhilarating experience, then WATCH THIS MOVIE. I'm the first to be happy to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Create, dance, fight with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
