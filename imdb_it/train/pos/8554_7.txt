Wow, this was another good spin-off of the original American pie, not as good as the band's field, but definitely better than the naked mile. Dwight and Erik Stifler lead the comedy in this, but in reality I preferred dialogue in this nude. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, however most of the comedy came from sex, but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies, right? <br /> <br /> Midget Rock also had a really good cameo, considering the intense effort it gave him in the nude, his stuffy scene was fantastic and made me laugh out loud when the 'I have seen. /> <br /> The film was a marked improvement over the naked mile, if you like previous American Pie movies, you'd like to have the beta house, unless you see all the American pie spin-offs waste of money.
