The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. He was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (I believe in the Bible). I don't get along with the crowd of right-wing believers. I left that atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me in their attempts to take control of the government, they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it Judah Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not understand it, although Jesus said that his Kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This film has certainly shown something of this. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus liked the simple pleasure of playing and joking with his disciples. <br /> <br /> It was also a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It is a film of success and control. <br /> <br /> Very satisfying.
