The PRC that was the lowest of the bass actually hit the gold with this little moody thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with "Detour", which is probably one of the best low budget films ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a one-set movie, full of fog and shadows, a technique used by most poverty studies to hide sets or lack thereof. But here, it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) staggers around the swamp killing those involved in his illicit execution for murder and generates some understanding on the part of the viewer. His last victim is to be the ferryman's daughter ..... focuses his anger not only on those directly involved in his destiny but also on their relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that goes through her acting style. He offers himself to the strangler to end the murder but as a sop to the public, the strangler sees the goodness of his gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and returns to the afterlife, a little chastened. If Ulmer (who directed "Detour") directed "Strangler", it would hang on the nearest tree and the strangler's work would be done. But who is complaining? History is not the main attraction, but the ensemble wrapped, the lighting and the general moodiness of the piece. It stands, right behind "Detour", as the most beautiful hour of the PRC
