What would happen if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy met on an evening of relativism? <br /> <br /> This delightful Roman al clef never uses the real names of the characters so thinly veiled and monstrously shows not only for the individuals who must have been, but also for what they have come to represent over time. If you are confused by the allegory, or if you like your movies served in a predictive and cheesy way, you will not like this movie. It is a demanding work that rewards the spectator on many levels with intelligence to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Leaving, for the moment, the rigorous avoidance of the use of the real names of the characters, we see Einstein, about to deliver a pacifist speech to a UN hell for nuclear weapons, which is visited by Marylin Monroe, after shooting the infamous Seven Year Itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage to Joe Dimaggio. They have a beautiful interaction in which Einstein stumbles with adequate professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sexual symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a red. He is determined to extract the security of Einstein who will support the activities of the House's Anti-American Activities Committee while providing the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person, perhaps not perfectly interpreted as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein has become his lover, even if Marylin just wants to show Einstein to understand the special relativity theory . <br /> <br /> But there's more. <br /> <br /> Just like any of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which reveal one by one in obsessive flashbacks. It is these weaknesses that ultimately lend humanity to figures that we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision and the film's statement becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Insignificance is one of my five best films of all time. It's absolutely incredible.
