I suppose I always felt that the Hotel du Nord was linked to the studio, the movement of cars and cameras was too simple and effortless to have been filmed on site. But no problem - it is still a very undervalued composition by Marcel Carne. Sometimes the plot seems a little discontinuous, as if they were making themselves up as they went along, but since it is unpredictable it keeps the attention at the bitter end. Money shoots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with a rather neat dialogue, but it's all so beautiful to fall into any madness can be accepted. Are these 2 young symbols of a cancerous disease in pre-war France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are quite common; if suicides are young and healthy with their lives in front of them would you not think of anything else except that they were just misguided fools? <br /> Arletty played the prostitute well - she kept that flash on her busy dress anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - it's the most impressive invention of Pimp in HDN - my problem is superficial: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A An extraordinarily atmospheric film, well acted and photographed, with so much success that it needs some visualizations to get everything in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film had a small homosexual fun part. All in all: wonderful.
