Terry Gilliam gives a sensational film, which I really enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small appearance of Christover Plummer make the film absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam film I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think this is one of Bruce Willis's four best films; and the best of Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt offers perfect performance. Perhaps one of the ten best performances of the actors I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted extraordinarily well. With the brilliant history of supporting great performances; and to support this, the superb direction of Terry Gilliam.
