In "Love Crimes" (1992) by Lizzie Borden, Sean Young plays a D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who immerses herself too deeply in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who presents himself as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them, then leaves them. <br /> <br /> Of course, this lonely soon decides to enter the life of a false shutter pretending to be his prey, with the intention of bringing him to justice. They meet, make love, then the next thing he knows, is on his knees, he is spanked. (Note: the spanking scene is only in the "unpublished" version of this film. The R-rated version omits it and many other scenes that would make the plot more lucid.) This psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images, like Bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, waving against her with a trophy. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Sean Young plays his cat - and "play" with Bergin, trying to capture him in an incriminating act. It is unfortunate that the film does not end, stop. It's true. The director Lizzie Borden may have just finished the story to tell, but after 92 minutes the end credits run, and there remains an enigmatic "what just happened?" loss. <br /> <br /> The development of Young's plan takes place in an appealing style, but the lack of a consistent ending will be a turning point for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
