I evaluated this ten just because I find what an individual eighteen year old can do with a video camera so impressive. It's not epic but it's very engaging and I've never been bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad movies that are spilled in mass, then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know I'll get in line at the local cinema for his first major release. Damn good work, and it's worth it. What a script! It could be a low budget, but it's a pity for half of the most important images I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both written and on screen. Congratulations to you, I can't wait to see more.
