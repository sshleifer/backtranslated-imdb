You know the story - a group of brave non-jumpers participate in a competition that apparently have no chance of winning - it's a story that was made to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Better etc.). Now Korea makes an attempt with a Taekwondo team fighting for glory ?? and guess what ?? the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film didn't fall on his face is due to the talent of the young cast that really makes you worry about the characters, and this in turn keeps you looking up to the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie could be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not offer the usual barrage of moves and stunts seen in most Kung Fu movies; the action is limited to (though impressive) kicks and occasional punches. This does not matter, since it is the interaction between the characters and their struggle to create something of themselves that makes this film a success.
