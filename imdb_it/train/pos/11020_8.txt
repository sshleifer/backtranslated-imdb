This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action film with lots of black humor. This was one of the greatest successes of 1993. This is one of the best films of Harlin. Lithgow is a terrible fun criminal. Stallone certainly made a brief return to this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a director. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a clear anamorphic Widescreen transfer (2.35: 1) and fantastic Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.
