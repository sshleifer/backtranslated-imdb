"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) by Emilio Miraglio is almost the most perfect example of a mystery I've ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements in a truly stew left. First of all, and of fundamental importance to me, it has a complex and tortuous plot that in the end makes perfect sense, and the killer here is not completely out of the left field at the end. The story, about a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the title of the film, right?) That apparently takes place the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, it is engaging, and the murderer, a red cloak figure with the mad laughter of a madwoman, it's both scary and memorable. Every great mystery requires some beautiful actresses, and here we have a nice assortment, driven by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her first roles, Sybil Danning, as a vagabond wanderer to Barbara's fashion house. Another necessary ingredient of a superior yellow is a captivating and humble score, and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. Wonderful landscapes? Check again. Shot mostly in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, the image is truly a feast for the eyes. OK, OK, but what about those murders? After all, isn't that what all the yellows are? Well, I am pleased to announce that most viewers should be satisfied with the various knives, shootings, impalements and other carnages that this film exhibits with taste ... not to mention the crypts, the extravagant sequence of dreams, rats and bats (and LOTS too!), references to drugs, a scene of rape, compulsory herring and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a strong and robust man for the spectators. As I said, a perfect yellow. And even better, this DVD is taken from the good people of No Shame, and you know what it means: a gorgeous print and lots of extras, to boot! Thank you guys!
