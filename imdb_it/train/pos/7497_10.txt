I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store when. I've always been a big Weird Al fan and when I saw this video I rented it and watched it. I was too young to appreciate all the subtle humor and satire of Al at the time, but I remember it a long time later, when I was old enough to understand what I was looking at. If you are a fan of "Al", especially of his previous works, you will love this movie. It is done in the "Rockumentary" style of MTV and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al was where he was in 1985. You will love him if you like his brand of humor and, most important, his music.
