Home Room really surprised me. In comparison to other films that have been written regarding the Columbine high school this is the best. The room in the house does not show the school footage, but rather the consequences and effects of the community and the city. The film focus' on two opposite characters., Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who has witnessed the entire shooting. It seems to show no emotion in this regard. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Alecia because they may have known that the shooting would take place. Alecia and Deanna are very different and at first they don't get along. Eventually they develop mutual mutual understanding and become friends. (very much in the style of the breakfast club). Home Room Beautifully demonstrates the power of closeness and turmoil after shooting at school. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
