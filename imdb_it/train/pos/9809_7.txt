Randolph Scott is heading to Albuquerque to find a job with his uncle. However, on the road there, the stage is blocked - even if they don't carry a safe. However, a nice woman on board is hiding $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the thieves seem to know. <br /> <br /> Once in the city, Scott goes to this uncle for work. However, he soon learns that this uncle is an idiot - the typical Western villain. You know, the rich guy who wants to get richer by tricking and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And just like that, this idiot was behind the robbery. Scott asks that the uncle return the money and then Scott goes into business with the beautiful lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is NOT the end of the problems --- just the beginning. Again and again, intrigues of various kinds occur to try to crush the uncle's opposition. One trick is to bring a beautiful lady to make friends with Scott and his partners. It sucks and looks bad to Scott - until he understands why he came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike Randolph Scott's later films, this shows Scott as a somewhat more stubborn man. Too often in his films he is the last to suggest violence, but in this film he is ready to suggest a lynching (screwing up the law, we are lucky) and later he is ready to threaten his uncle. What a surprise to see it as a hot head - even if in many other ways, it's the same old Scott you would expect. <br /> <br /> As for the film, there is nothing particularly unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the villain can't be thought out and in the end he is destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very typical plot, it is very well managed and therefore deserves your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the film. First, in the late movie, there is a fight between Scott and his uncle's henchman, Lon Chaney, Jr .. In it, Chaney smokes as he fights - something I've never seen before and I admired how he could walk away while he took to kick your butt. Secondly, take a load of that runaway trolley scene - now that was an impossible feat!
