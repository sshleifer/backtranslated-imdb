A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a film you don't see every day. He has excellent actors with an excellent history. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but holds the role of John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors. The story is not new but the story takes a new direction on it. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about a virus that has wiped out most of mankind. <br /> <br /> the actors in this were fantastic. I have to give a mention to Brad Pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) meets in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The director has done an extraordinary job in bringing us a disturbing image of a future devastated by a man-made virus. <br /> <br /> Animals seen in the world of viruses have made them feel like they are in control of the world when humans are led into underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This film was excellent and must see and is also a must. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
