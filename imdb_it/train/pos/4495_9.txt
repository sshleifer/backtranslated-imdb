Outside the family there is a different world and the family struggles to overcome the line between dad's authority and his hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is captured; The Bakelite light oscillates, the Georgian floor, the image rails, the wallpaper, the short skirts, the cheeky boys, the Mini van, the bright modern batons .... <br /> <br /> The place he is captured; A glacier whipped by the wind has carved a rocky landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deceit, male chauvinism, manners, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenting are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is an expression rich in family tensions that are as current as ever. The fact that some of these are not directly addressed is in itself a testament to the attitudes of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the ability of acting, plot and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is something negative about this film, it is that all this deeply rooted and wonderfully enunciated tension is swept away a little too lightly. Perhaps I realized that the ruin and sadness of many adolescents really disappear if they deal with this (**) - perhaps the film is trying to send even that message - it's worth doing. <br /> <br /> is the film trying to say? Children: even parents were young, parents struggle, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, the struggle can end happily. Parents: don't try too much! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> Sounds simplistic doesn't it? Sometimes the film looks like this, but then you notice how it is tested and discovered. <br /> <br /> The film is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the problems themselves.
