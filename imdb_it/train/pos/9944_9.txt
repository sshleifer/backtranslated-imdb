Of course, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "big" films of these times are incredibly shocking or high-budget / somehow advertised. <br /> <br /> Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do. Regardless of what you expect from this film, you will feel troubled by the work, the pain and the expectations that the characters will force you to try. Although comic, sometimes, many moments and characters are wonderfully rendered: there is the old guard character who takes things too seriously, the hooligan has become a good guy who only wants a second chance at life, the mild substitute of the team that would die happy if he has just won once in his life and many other well-rounded characters with his own problems, but above all his hopes and dreams. While the plot and objectives of the film are simple, these aspects of the film simply highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and interpersonal struggles. <br /> <br /> In short, this film will make you feel fresh, determined and satisfied.
