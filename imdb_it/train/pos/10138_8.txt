Well, it's time. I had really given up on everyone and I hope there will be a highlight among the voices of this season. Although there are still too many obscene voices in Hohum's voices, at least this episode has been successful. It's pretty funny the director Rob Schmidt who has only the bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only screenplay jobs to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and thought provocative episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we deal with the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode the couple is having a conversation. Abbey has surprised Cliff to cheat and is trying desperately to win her back. As they talk, they find themselves in a traffic accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and catches fire when a spark ignites and the gasoline she spilled drips onto the fire. And this is just the installation staff. Once in the hospital, Cliff must decide whether Abbey should live in this state without skin and only nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect. Whenever she sits down, Abbey walks like a ghost and causes trouble for all kinds of people. Without a doubt this is the best episode of the season and certainly one of the best episodes of all time. From the gruesome effects to the tense script that has thrown in some twists and turns that I've never seen coming and the palpable suspense that you can almost touch, Right To Die should have the right to continue to live forever.
