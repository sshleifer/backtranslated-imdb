This is a well done documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car racing. Photography is simply exceptional. The scene was that Mario Andretti drives the old racing roadster along the New England road flanked by ancient maples, the leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car, it's incredible. The film loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like watching the cars driven to the limit you have to watch this movie.
