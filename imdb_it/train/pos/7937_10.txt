I thought the movie "I Do They Do Not" was fantastic. In the past I saw Rob Estes in "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett in "Melrose Place" and I loved seeing them together again in "I Do They Do not". They have a great chemistry together (I think being married in real life is helpful!) - in the film both are widowed with children and careers and fall in love and try to mix their chaotic families already engaged together without dropping the ball. Of course they stumble, but they hold it together, which is what family work and growth is. So many people have talked about this movie - so good! - and the film left us wanting more. This would make a great series - attractive for many ages! - It would be nice to see a real life, feet on the ground, a family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "Reality TV" that all the stations are sweeping us with these days. Someone tells the people of the ABC Family that they have a new series here!
