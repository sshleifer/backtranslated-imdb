This is a very funny film that follows the trial of a Macbeth NY production. Although he has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best when you're not taking it too seriously. Recognizable actors like John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do beautiful jobs in the main roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene in which the Banquo murder (John Elsen) takes place. Probably a more fun movie for those involved in the theater, but anyone who loves Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
