I honestly think that that was the best version of the war of the worlds that I've all seen. it was fun but it was also educational i learned the whole movie and if i could do it from that movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robots and another came from behind. in the last war movie in the world I think it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better. but anyway I give this movie 2 inches up. <br /> <br /> and if they were to make another film like this, I will definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> thanks
