Ok, I admit that casting in the film is VERY weird - part of it is due to the plot, but I still had trouble believing that Pierce Brosnan played this role (even though he did a really good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with Canadian Indians at the beginning of the 20th century. He claimed to be an Indian mixed with blood. In fact, he was so successful and well thought that people came from all sides to listen to his lessons and be taken for his journeys in the wilderness - even though he was not an Indian mixed with blood and all his knowledge came from the books or falsified! The film focuses on this and what happened when the joke was discovered. <br /> <br /> The acting and the settings were great and I liked the film very much (once I suspended disbelief about Brosnan). He didn't have a widespread distribution - probably because he was rather cerebral - not a Bond movie or a love story - just a really weird movie about an extraordinary man.
