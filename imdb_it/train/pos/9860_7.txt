This film had no hilarious parts, mostly just funny media units, but it didn't even have parts that were really bad. The worst part was Sid's voice. His indolent insult was too much for me. After about 5 minutes I was tired of hearing him speak. Regardless of the boring sloth voice, the film was good. There were numerous side jokes that if you take them they make the film much better. This is a good movie for children. He has enough to keep adult content and enough to keep the kids entertained. This is definitely worth renting if you have children and want to watch a movie with them.
