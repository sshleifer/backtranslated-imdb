I saw this movie on TV many years ago and saw this movie when I recorded it on tape. I thought this was reasonably well done. It wasn't the best of all the movies, but it was pretty good. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially the little ones. The acting was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot was not very credible, but the script was well written. This film can also be the interest of avid baseball fans. Does not apply directly to an action-packed sports film. It applies directly to a good movie that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film. Overall, the film was good, but not exceptional. I give this a 7/10 movie.
