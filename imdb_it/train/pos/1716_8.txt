Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets his "Hello Sister" !!!. This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl escaped from her home in Nainital and comes to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't show up leaving Soha with a broken heart and alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the boy next door from the lower class becomes protective of the vulnerable Soha and helps her find work and housing in a nursing home. The romance slowly blossoms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan is part of Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A sensibly made film with a very unusual story, lovingly filmed in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. Does this well-made film have moments that will remain forever etched in memory? the first embarrassing kiss and Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "wali ladki class" and hastily adds "that he does not love her"; her donation of a churidar to Soha and invites her to go out for an appointment. <br /> <br /> The music is good and the background music is excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes and embraces Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. The quiet transmits both the embarrassment and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The poignant finish makes a film bitter sweet, whose memories will remain long. <br /> <br /> To see, I will evaluate it 8.5 / 10
