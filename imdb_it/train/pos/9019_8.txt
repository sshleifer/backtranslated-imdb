Not wanting to give * anything * here, I would say that this little flic technical, excellent, impeccable and uplifting will reward the spectator with an excellent hour and a half of entertainment: he will have fun, surprise, eventually embarrass himself from time to time and almost certainly will pick up the ropes of the heart from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clich√© or predictable in any way. The most definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for the outstanding performances of Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I completely agree ....
