(WARNING: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I came across this part and looked from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. It certainly caught my attention; I didn't know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy with whom he did the dirty deed came out as a really nice guy who just made his head spin from a devious girl; I have to ask myself how faithful this portrait is to life. Anyone who kills a husband and wife while they sleep cannot be entirely kind. However, I had a certain liking for him, since he had been created and had taken advantage of it; this has been clarified. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is about the ending (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, there seemed to be no way to discover the truth. The way it was discovered was in a "sting" operation, but my question is: how did the police get it together? The film didn't show it, and the explanation of how they were persuaded to do so seemed a little too convenient. <br /> <br /> I think the way they were handled was made for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation gave an aura of suspense to the crucial scene that otherwise wouldn't have been there (we would have already known what the scene was about, and what was happening to Brad in it). <br /> <Otherwise, this is a pretty good movie; I give 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested in finding out the facts of the real case. <br /> <br /> Another thing: the film was made in 1996. Some reviews seem to treat it as a more recent film. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is adorable. I had never seen it before. She too can behave a little (always an advantage in her line of work, LOL).
