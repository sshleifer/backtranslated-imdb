WOW! <br /> <br /> This film is the best living testament, I think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in New York, compared to what is shown by the major media. <br /> <br /> the stores can only show you what happened outside. This movie shows you what happened on INSIDE. <br /> <br /> Start with a focus on a New York firefighter, waiting weeks for the first big fire he will be called to fight. The subject changes abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING SERVICE OF THE FIRST FLOOR TO HIT THE TOWERS. You are given a front row seat while firefighters rush to the scene, in the lobby of Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes preceding the crash of the second plane, and the subsequent fall of Tower Two, firefighters are seen reacting to the disturbing sound of people landing above the atrium. It is a show that I will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> Astonishing, tearful and very exciting from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
