I've never seen this movie until I bought the tape last year. I was fascinated and amused. It has all the elements of what I love to see in a science fiction story, in a book or on the screen. There are social comments, speculations and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something mysterious and fun, looking at a 1936 vision of the "distant future" of the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see, and not just for Sci-Fi.
