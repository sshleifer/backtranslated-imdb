Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman, presented in a complete and very credible way, despite being so dull as to touch implausibility. He will do everything to make his marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus, outside the aesthetics of vice, it reveals a rather sweet value system. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending that later feels completely inadequate, with the familiar familiarity of ending the school's creative writing exercise with "and then I woke up". It's also finished from one book to the other end of the most eccentric sequence of titles I've ever seen, but don't let anyone put you out of the game.
