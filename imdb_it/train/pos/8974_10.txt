Jiøí Trnka made his latest animated film an accusation of totalitarianism, which caused him problems in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the simple symbolisms, and their brand ornaments almost absent here, allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable. A man in his room is dedicated to ceramics and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of herself. The man refuses and is haunted by the unfortunate gloved hand. These days, where the impression of the reality factor seems to be erased by most animations that seek to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a movie, which makes its technique part of the fun.
