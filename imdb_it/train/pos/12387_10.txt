Of all the films of the seventies, no one has captured the truest essence of the battle against evil as did the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were films like the exorcist and others; but none of them has captured the human element of the protagonist like this. If you have time, check this. You may not be able to pass devices that are dated as such, but this is a story worth entering. Then there are all the stars and future stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what is happening. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch all the weirdest statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake". Furthermore, the books are really good. I'm just sorry that they won't turn the second book into a movie. It's so scary that it would surpass this movie.
