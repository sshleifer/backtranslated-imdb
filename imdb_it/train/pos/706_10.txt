I have to say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's acting is simply fantastic. For my part, sleepless, I can relate to how history develops. I've never experienced anything like this, but some awake moments overlap with sleep and can be scary. It was a great movie, worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess alone, it would be an honor and more. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not small children because they might be afraid. But if you are a sleepless like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and fear. You will like it. <br /> <br /> F.
