Yes, it was a low budget, but this movie shows love! The only negative thing is that we can say that the budget of this film is not comparable to "Waterworld" and although the plot was good, the film has never fully exploited its full potential! Everyone's strong performances and suspense make the vision of a rainy night worthwhile.
