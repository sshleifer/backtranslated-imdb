Now I adore American Pies 1 and 2 while 3 have been great only for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler, but after that the quality has decreased. Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you really cared about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and the same recycled storylines (Erik Stifler's sexual problem is similar to Jim's). He had some fun moments like the football game against the dwarves and the "punishment" of Coozeman, but on the whole he lacked originality and the "Mile" was simply stupid and idiotic. Not to mention the irritating girl who doesn't want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Enough however on the Naked Mile. I watched Beta House apprehensively because I thought it might take the series to a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real storyline but it is full of sexy girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex jokes in abundance. Yes, it's terrific and the lines are old but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance. The Greek Olympics are home to the penultimate and recent events while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. There are weaknesses though. Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first, I'm still baffled by how he ever got a part. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch, but in Beta House he brought his performance to a new low. First of all he lacks charisma, a Stifler prerequisite. You really don't care about him. The only reason I was worried about his report was that Ashley could be on screen! She gleams above him like the rest of the cast does. Seriously John White is the last in bad acting and has more charisma than a dead fish. <br /> <br /> Saying that the film is entertaining and Coozeman's fear that his girlfriend is not exactly a girl is extraordinarily funny. <br /> <br /> All in all it is worthwhile to rent this movie, take some of your friends and laugh at the vom-fest event and let your anger out at Erik 'loser' Stifler.
