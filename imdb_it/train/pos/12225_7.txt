I saw this movie and even though I somehow knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes in the very Lifetime movie network. And I think that since it's close to Halloween, they could play more. So please be careful if you are interested in watching it. I think Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really like her as an actress and a person. She looks so pretty and down to earth. Kevin Dillon, his performance was so good for me. I'm not trying to fight him or anything, but I think his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad serial killer better. Kevin seems too sweet for me. But I think he did well.
