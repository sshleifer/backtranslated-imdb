The classic (mostly) unclassified of Bogdonovich is a film unlike any other. A film that has the feeling of a fairy tale, but has a solid foundation in reality thanks to its use of authentic Manhattan locations and a "real" geography, perhaps the best location in which to film in New York I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) it can be brilliant, and the whole ensemble is a group that you would really like to exist so you can spend time with `em. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the highest point of Bogdanovich's fertile "success" career, when his best work was really done ("saint jack" , "finally ...", "noises off".
