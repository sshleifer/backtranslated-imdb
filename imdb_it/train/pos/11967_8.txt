I don't know if it's a sitcom or not, but I agree that this is one of the biggest TV shows ever. It's nice that this show is still on the air. And I love Michelle. She is pretty in episodes when she was little and talked, and sometimes she said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show can involve children and adolescents and ... well, families that struggle in difficult times and try to solve them like a family. I don't know who could ever refuse to see this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode when I think his name is DD ... the older girl stole a sweatshirt by accident and learned a lesson on theft. it was a great episode. An example that this television program shows the family that works as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
