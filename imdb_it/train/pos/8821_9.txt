The question is: can a funny film be considered a "bad" film? My husband and I took it in a video store used for 99 cents simply for the title and the fact that on the box there were the words "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron was considered a quality mark since my first appearance I acquired the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We didn't expect a movie full of victories like this. Your basic plot is the following: Grange, this goomba-like hooligan of planet Earth, kidnaps "the bank of the moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I don't even remember the name of the planet) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. The "governor" of that colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three in the world) reminds prisoners that there is no way out, because there is only one shuttle from all over the planet and they are dealing with him. Then there is the unnamed "Colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a recurring recurring nightmare. Much of the film revolves around "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with slabs slapped to the sides) with explosions galore. The planet itself seems suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of the other dusty outposts of the Inland Empire. But what makes the movie really brilliant is a surprisingly impressive soundtrack with several punk Los Angeles bands from the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack has ever been pressed on vinyl, but it is definitely worth buying the film only for the soundtrack. I can't even remember the names of the bands (they are listed in the credits) other than Exploding White Mice, because he was the only one I'd ever heard before seeing this movie, but I'm definitely looking at them. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is certainly not a waste of time and it would be better to enjoy it with a pack of 12 beers and some of your closest friends.
