This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a funny movie, or a well made movie. This is a point of reference in the art of animation and, even if it were not, only the technical skill needed to make it happen would have guaranteed him a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz has created a stop-motion film about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with works, houses, nightclubs, cinemas, even small props like posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this film he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has a relationship with a dancing dragonfly, much to the disappointment of a grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle having a relationship. Mr. Beetle chases his lover, but forgives his wife. The two wear make-up and go to the cinema. And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and the Dragonfly. Described in this way it seems trivial, but once seen it becomes a compelling work of cinema. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz practically invented everything that future animators would use in their work. For this reason it must not be forgotten.
