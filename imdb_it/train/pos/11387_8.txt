An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter who lives in Paris for inspiration. Meet a rich woman who admires her paintings on the street and believes she can make her work even more popular for the public, eg. in a museum. The Golden Globe nomination Gene Kelly as the artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect for both singing and dancing. He also meets the main girl Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron) who is engaged to her best friend. He can't help his feelings for this girl, even after discovering with whom he is engaged. Filled with beautiful love stories and wonderful songs and dances, this is a great musical movie. He could drag himself slightly with his dreamlike dancing sequence, the American ballet in Paris, but there is a good happy ending. He won the Oscars for the best scenography, the decoration, the best photography, the best scenography, the best music, the score of a film, the best screenplay, the story and the script and the best film, and was nominated for the best director of Vincente Minnelli and Best Film Editing, he was nominated BAFTA for best film from any source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical / Comedy, and was nominated for the best director of Vincente Millenni (father of Liza). Gene Kelly was number 100 of The 100 Movie Stars, and was number 15 in 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, "I Got Rhythm" was number 32 in 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 9 in 100 Years of Musicals, was the number 39 out of 100 years, 100 passions, was the number 68 out of 100 years, 100 films, and was the number 58 on 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!
