I had no expectations; I had never heard of Jamie Foxx; all I knew was that the film has strong actors. I thought it was very funny; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to arouse my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is fantastic (true, this is not his best role). I thought the chases and the pyrotechnic effects contributed to the film and were well made. I didn't expect much and I was happily surprised.
