A success at the moment, but now better classified as an Australian cult film. The humor is broad, indistinct and, in the final scene where a BBC studio fire goes off urinating on it, crude. It contains almost all the clichés on the traditional Australian pilgrimage to "the old country", and every cliché about those raptors, wedged, whining, British Tories. It would be acceptable to the British because of its cast of famous actors and Australians of that generation, who can "get" humor. Americans - forget it. The language and the jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and as such will be incomprehensible.
