This is what the musical genre is made of. Humor, talent, romance and action come together in one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing else needs to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job conquering the hearts of many with his performance of Sky Masterson. The fact that he couldn't sing added to his character. The girls in the movie were fine, but the men in the film definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all the public and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch and have fun!
