It took a couple of episodes to "get into" Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were passing by The Sopranos, a very different mentality structure. But once we reached the top of the series, we were very quickly captured. It's a shame that the series is over just when it was just starting to go well in the excellent category: Dark Angel was much more than your average TV series. He kicks his ass and swings about the action, but the interactions between the characters and society's reactions to the "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. That the plot is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed into our faces (thus not ruining the "fun" for those who do not like to be kept in conference during entertainment), but every event and human-company interaction remains relevant to the present. We all make judgments, we face our prejudices, but in the end, the question about who you are mentally: do you sit and close your mind, or do you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, to survive or justice, this series enhances them. For those who have never had to face the question, this series "sneaks" that message in the guise of pure action fun. It is much more well done and well written than most TV series; I am very disappointed that it ended before he could really give his best.
