This is a horror-based television program that does it well. On Friday 13 the series had no connection with the films. Poltergeist the legacy: I'm not so sure. It may have been freely linked to the movies. It looks like they throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it. <br /> <br /> It shows that Freddy was burned by the parents of Elm's street (in the 1st episode I believe) and the amount of parents was disappointing. With all the children he has targeted in the first 3 movies, you would expect there to be more parents. But oh well. <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically the narrator for the show. Observe the actions of people in the real world sometimes involved in some way. Just like the other anthology shows like Tales from the crypt, there is a supernatural or surprise twist. <br /> <br /> Acting is missing but believe it or not: violence sometimes exceeds that of the film. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. I heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. I've seen a lot of nominal stuff as a kid, so it's a shame that parents have to ruin it for everyone. Four more films arrived after the series, so it wasn't a total loss.
