After losing the herd of cattle to a dishonest attorney, one lead ends up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and little chance of being able to return to the United States. While there his fortunes take a turn for the better until an unfortunate specter comes from the past. Good western with many old favorite faces in the lineup.
