This is pretty well known, so I'll never go into it. The basic story is of two teenagers discovering a slimy alien goo blob that arrives on earth via meteor. Human contact with this ball of slime burns through the flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies making them larger. Nobody believes the boys (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob cannot be stopped. It's really well done for his age and, unlike many other 50s, the pace is pretty fast. The story is truly unique and makes it a must for fans of old science fiction movies and monsters. If you can dig the sticky horror stuff of the 1980s, make sure you take a look at the 88 remake too.
