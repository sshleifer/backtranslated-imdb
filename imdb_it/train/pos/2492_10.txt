this is one of the most fun shows I've ever seen. it's really refreshing to watch and I've been to points many times. I imagine there is also a factor of social awareness that makes it quite interesting. if they were white girls would they have the same reaction? maybe they would do it, maybe they wouldn't do it? the characters know no limits (check my lyrics) and don't exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorites are the manufacturer's. he is so stupid that he is brilliant. if you like twisted black comedy, then this is for you. if you like to keep up appearances you probably aren't. Not blonde is yet another hilarious BBC British comedy shown on TV! It's such a fun show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting audience are laughing at funny crackles! It would be impossible to keep a straight face by looking at the crazy characters and the reactions of the audience! This series easily adds to the excellent comedies produced!
