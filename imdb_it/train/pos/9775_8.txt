Tears of Kali is an original but imperfect horror film that explores the actions of a cult group in India composed of German psychologists who have learned to control their wills and bodies to the point where others can be "healed" through radical techniques (which can trigger nightmare hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to free the repressed demons within them. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a series of cartoons about the Taylor-Eriksson group - the cult group mentioned above. The first segment is a little slower than the rest, but it serves well to set the conditions for the rest of the film. The rest takes place like a mindf @ ck movie with some of the main keys thrown into the mix (full frontal nudity, a bit of cold blood) to make you happy. <br /> <br /> I say take a look at this. It may not be spectacular, but its concept is very beautiful and offers the right points. 8/10.
