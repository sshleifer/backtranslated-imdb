This film is a little unusual in that it has a very subtle texture and the film itself is made at a very slow and pleasant pace. While this makes it quite different from the average Grant movie, it is still highly watchable and fun. It is as if someone were saying "let's follow Cary around and watch as they get upset about all the little problems that arise when a house is reorganized". Considering that funny actor is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has rather modest claims, it makes most of the material. It's a fantastic movie for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
