"Foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed him (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the film holds up well against the clock. <br /> <br /> The theme of adolescent anxiety is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember?) direct a young and refined cast that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film follows four girls from Southern California as they travel through a life without roots of sex and drugs and without parents. Kids spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts or out on the street. I am rarely at home because immediate gratification is a pill, a party or a boy. <br /> <br /> But rather than condemning them, the film is sympathetic, blaming the absent and uncaring adults to force the boys to grow alone. And the charismatic cast is impossible not to appreciate. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film ?? a long and loving pan - set the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at dawn among the objects that define adolescent childhood, from Twinkies to a photo of a young John Travola, while "On the Radio" by Donna Summer is marked below. <br /> <br /> From there the film picks up speed while the girls go to school and to life. Annie (the runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the queen of the crazy boy drama. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl in over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. His job is to keep this crew long enough to finish high school while also holding the divorced and desperate man looking for his mother in line (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It's almost impossible work and one that Foster eventually fails to. <br /> <br /> Despite its age, "Foxes" remains a pleasure to watch. Blond hair, clothes and references to the Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill did not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply amazing, with breathtaking shots of the L.A. at dawn, at sunset and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds a soundtrack from the 80s with artists like Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film is that the young stars around Foster have never broken out like the casts of "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But maybe like the Bowling for Soup song "1985", they just hit a wall.
