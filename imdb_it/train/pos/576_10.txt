this film was genius, casting, setting, history, direction, everyone adapted to the part they played, and one could only imagine being there, Robert Redford is an extraordinary actor and now the director himself, Norman's father is came from the same Scottish island as me, so I loved the fact that there was a real bond with this film, the witty remarks throughout the film were fantastic, it was simply brilliant, so much so that I bought the film as soon as it is been released for retail and I recommend everyone to watch, and fly fishing was incredible, really cried in the end it was so sad, and you know what they say if you cry in a movie must have been good, and this is was certainly, even congratulations to the two boys who played Norman and Paul were simply brilliant, children are often excluded from the list of praise, I think, because the stars that reproduce them are a such a great profile for the whole film, but these children are fantastic and should be praised for what they did, don't you think? the whole story was so beautiful because it was true and someone's life was shared with all of us after all.
