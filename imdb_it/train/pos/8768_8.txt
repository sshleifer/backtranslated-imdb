I saw this movie in a store in the business section. In fact, I vividly remembered seeing the commercials and the trailer for years. I thought "What the hey" and bought it, basically because the plot looked interesting and Claire Danes has always been someone talented in my eyes (even before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> So these are two girls who go on holiday to Bangkok, get caught for narcotics (of which they are innocent) and then are sent to a prison in Thailand. The film follows what will happen to them and sometimes doubts their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great shows, and the plot of this film wraps itself unconventionally and raises some nice questions for moral discussion. <br /> <br /> I think this is a solid good movie, but there could have been improvements, it could have been longer ... it would have helped to consolidate these characters and get more information on the justice system's policy Thai that would help. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, it's a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all you pop culture junkies, look for a two-minute role in Paul Walker. I didn't even notice it the first time I saw the movie.
