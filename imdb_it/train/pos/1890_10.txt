This is one of those movies I've seen so many times that I can name most of them. Some lines of this film are simply unbeatable. I particularly like to see him stumble and fall while I'm drunk, go to the elegant drunk restaurant and the part with the moose. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I've seen this sequence, but it's fun every time. From the moment Arthur arrives at Susan's father's place with the moose, you laugh practically all the time. I remember looking at the exits concerning the piece with the moose. He went down just as I imagined he would be. They were all laughing so hard that it was difficult for them to film it. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His behavior, his jokes and the way he handled Arthur were all equally hilarious. It's always a fun time when he hits him on the head with his hat or tells him he's a small ____ spoiled. I laugh every time I listen to "I'm going to take a bath" and the lines that follow.
