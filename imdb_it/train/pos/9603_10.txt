I have one word for a while about this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. The people in the theater were sobbing. This film shows the difficulties that Darius suffers with Muscular Dystrophy. The film was very well done and really made you part of the film, I was so emotionally moved by the film because it reminded us that we are very lucky to be in perfect health, some people in this world are less strong than us. And sometimes we should help them and help them to the end. I'd give them ten stars, they gave Darius a gift when he wasn't asked, they didn't do it for the money they made for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius went to the west.
