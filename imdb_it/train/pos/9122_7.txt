Purple Rain is a great movie if you're a 40-year-old music lover who made music with Prince in the 1980s. History is a widely used formula: the growing musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its audience and self-respect. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, in particular of Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, is worth sitting in the film. He is himself and as a showman, as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, about Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, former Prince protégé, is beautiful and shows talent and chemistry with Prince, but her script does not leave her far away. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
