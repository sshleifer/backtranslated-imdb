I bought the DVD of this version to compare the current version of BBC 2005 (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and died this year (2005). I remember the acting, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and the music on the go. (The music in the 2005 version is much more discreet, but very significant.) Just to catch other commentators on a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther's. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake has never played Krook in either version, nor played Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby is played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens's great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality can make you jump sometimes, but I dare you not to cry - and laugh!
