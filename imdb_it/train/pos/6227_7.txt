Definitely one of the minor musicals of Astaire / Rogers. It is only very little structured and stimulated. For example, it only lasts a few minutes longer than the Swing Time, but it feels much longer. This is partly due to the secondary novel between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely ever interesting. I like Hilliard. It's sweet and I love at least one of his songs, "But where are you?" ("Get You Behind Me Satan", his other number, is a weakness left by Top Hat, fortunately cut from that masterpiece). Following the fleet would actually be a bad movie if it weren't for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition contends for the first place of any of their numbers. The dance is simply fantastic. "I'm putting all the eggs in a basket" presents the two trying on a dance they haven't yet perfected. Its imperfections make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So the film deserves to be seen for its good times.
