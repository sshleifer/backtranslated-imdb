This is a superb film, suitable for all but the youngest, even if the accessibility for the younger ones has been ruined (at least in the print I saw) by the use of some unfortunate choice of English subtitles! For most of the film it is practically impossible to guess in what time frame is set - there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, only a gray, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which it is opposed the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and celebratory fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure for a theater of war, this could be at any time for the past 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see a motor car - late 1930s, early 1940s style - and we realize that we are looking at a China on the brink of huge upheavals and that much of the world that we are seeing is being swept away in the cataclysm of the Second World War and the communist revolution. <br /> <br /> Which makes the desire of the central character to adhere to old customs and traditions even more intense. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises questions that are of vital importance even today, both in China and in other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm reading too much in this movie; but I don't think so! I also think it is a scandal that films of this caliber are not often shown in the United Kingdom, while waste is transmitted as a quality material. <br /> <br /> But don't let me get started on this ...
