In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer that can replace the actor and the writer. Unfortunately, this type of "character driven" film is too rare these days. The performances of Duvall and James Earl Jones are faithful to the high expectations of the public. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a "close" personal quality in the narrative. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all exceptional. The only thing that prevents being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great director of photography, but the beautiful photos are not everything. How can the talents Jones and Duvall continue to produce such a beautiful work in an age in which the actors pose for digitization?
