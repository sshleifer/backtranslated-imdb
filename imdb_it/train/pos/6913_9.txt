As a theatrical community actor who works hard but doesn't act too seriously, I am always amused by those who treat him as Great Art. This movie pins the "Actor's Craft" mercilessly as he draws lots of good laughs. <br /> <br /> A ham actor in place for a film bears a resemblance to the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drinking and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to act "the part of a life" by the neo-Nazi chief of the secret service. He plays it all the way, makes the dictator's girlfriend fall in love with him and vice versa, and transforms the tables of his captors beautifully. <br /> <br /> Lots of nice lead shticks, a lot of good work from some unknown secondary actors, particularly the domestic staff and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameos. Sammy Davis Jr. becomes light, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else that happens, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and especially Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film, but it has a lot of beautiful settings (in Brazil), a humorous script, and good actors who do their own thing and seem to really enjoy themselves and not go through the usual existential anxiety on what is just acting!
