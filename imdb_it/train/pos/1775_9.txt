I often wonder why this series has been slammed so much. I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and interpreted. I think that in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever release it. Many young emerging comedians have appeared in this and have gone on to bigger things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and must be released. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and no less important Julian Rhind-Tutt of the highly successful Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of the modern age. Anyone who can produce comedies like Father Ted could not be able to write something that does not deserve to be published. If it ever comes out, I will definitely buy it.
