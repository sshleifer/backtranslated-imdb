"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first color film of Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly it is not a question of samurai, ronin, warlords or battlefields. It is in a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where the inhabitants are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, battered women, losers. I don't know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and the environment to put colors, but in reality they are very sad stories, some of them heartbreaking. Personally, I like the touching story of the boy and his father who dream with a house of their own and built by them; the story of the retarded boy who thinks he drives a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden ?? o Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden ?? The Way of the Life")
