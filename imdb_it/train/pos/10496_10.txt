Great actors, an Oscar-nominated actress, wonderful landscapes, a plot of strong stories and more laughter than you can put in my new handbag (and that's pretty big). This film was brilliant. It was beautifully played in the most serious scenes and the funny moments were. .good, lateral division. I never heard a movie audience laugh so much, and tears ran down my cheeks during the "stoned women in the cafeteria" scene. Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson whose magical ingredients have made this one of my favorite movies of the year, if not all time.
