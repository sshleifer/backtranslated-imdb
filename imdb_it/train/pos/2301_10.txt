Really ... and an incredible film that is not very popular though ... extremely touching and almost life altered ... it was for me at least. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my list of favorite movies .... is number one now .... <br /> <br /> This is a very touching film that everyone should see .. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon ..... we will simply be incredible. Now it's my favorite movie and I've only seen it today and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15, as long as you're a little mature ... If you don't really try the emotions of the characters, then you? I will never have the true meaning and value of this film .... But it is really incredible .... look at it only because it will change the way some people look at life .... worth seeing 5/5
