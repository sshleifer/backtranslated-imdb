Do you know how Star Trek fans crowded all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? To see their heroes in action once again. This is how I feel about Doc Savage. I'm a big fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew on an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film have only accentuated that feeling of waiting. Then they decided to share elements from a number of Doc's adventures and insert them into this film, resulting in a somewhat disjointed movie. There is a lot of promise here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the elements of the "field", etc.) But the spirit of Doc is there, and that's what those of us who are familiar with Doc and the his crew respond. So, in my long-winded way, what I'm trying to say is that this isn't a bad movie: it's not as good as it should have been. And whoever is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should check out this movie just to get acquainted with the hero who provided the inspiration for them all.
