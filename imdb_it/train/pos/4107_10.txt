I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, witty ... It doesn't make sense to tell the content of the film, because then I would give the result! You have to see it without knowing what it is! Everything is connected and has its why and why. Start in a sneaky way and then things start to roll faster and faster until they culminate in the craziest explosion imaginable! It's even more fun to watch the movie the second time, once you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a true masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
