I must say that I agree with Cal-37, it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the girl is really talented and pretty, obviously Jim Belushi has earned his stripes! But I wish I really liked the piano song, if you are a musician or you don't watch this movie just for that, you will know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You're nobody until someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So have fun watching <br /> <br /> See you, <br /> <br /> Nelson
