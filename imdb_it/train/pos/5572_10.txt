This film was hysterical. I didn't laugh so long. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting", but was it supposed to be? Actually I went to the advanced screening I was expecting much less and I was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is warm and fantastic. The entire audience with whom I projected it seemed to enjoy the film as much as I did.
