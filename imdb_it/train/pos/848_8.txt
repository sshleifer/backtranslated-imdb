The turning point in "The Matador" comes in the middle of the film when Danny, an unsophisticated man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his hotel in Mexico City, enjoying a moment of tranquility. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing he's Julian, the paid murderer refuses to answer. But does it really have? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, the director of "The Matador", introduces us to a character, Julian Noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. In fact, we've already seen it in action, doing what it does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real in Mexico City, he spreads the beans and tells his new knowledge what he really does for a living. Danny, who came to sell his program for a Mexican company, but seems to be competing with a local group that seems to be in the front row to get the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls prey to the charisma and charm of the most intelligent Julian. It is only some time later, on a cold winter night, that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this point that the secret that unites them is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against the type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble. Just to see him walk in the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression on his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this strange couple. Hope Davis appears only in a couple of scenes that leave us complaining because she didn't stay longer. Philip Baker Hall looks like the connection between Julian and his assignments. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard manages the work with his own material in style. The soundtrack is by Rolfe Kent and David Tattersall's clear cinematography enhances everything.
