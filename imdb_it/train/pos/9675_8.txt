Most people might say that if you were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie, you must be really bored. Actually, I had just come home since I was out and turned on the TV and there was "Paulie". <br /> <br /> I missed the credits, so I didn't know the name but I saw that there was Ceech Marin, so I naturally thought I was tuned to "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late at night. <br /> <br /> Happy to say, it was better than that. As you know, if you don't already, Paulie is lost and is trying to get back to his original owner. It seems that it took years to find it. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a disadvantage in terms. People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit from it. <br /> <br /> While the character of Cheech Marin "is" making money with him, he is not bad with him. Parrot dance sequences are something kids will find nice, I found them fun. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all humans are good people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man lies to him saying that he will help him find his owner until he helps him in his research on animal communication. Paulie is now stuck but decides to tease the man during a demonstration to others of Paulie's vocal ability. <br /> <br /> In the film, Paulie tells his story to the facility's janitor who ends up releasing him, several other animals and finding the location of Paulie's owner. It's a touching meeting. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing clipping scene should have been taken and not shown. That part could disturb younger children. Otherwise, it is a fantastic film for older children and adults who are children at heart. (END)
