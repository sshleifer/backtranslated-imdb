I saw the episodes aired online and I was so sad that the show would not be back. He had the best cast of mature and talented actors and an incredible chemistry. It seems that all actors are personal friends in real life. Towards the end the show became engaging, sexy and highly watchable. Of course, some of the narrative lines are not realistic, so what ... The characters are all nice and you are the root for them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great compliments to all the cast. Note to ABC executives: Nielsen valuation reports show no real results. The spectator will record it mostly. I was very disappointed with the major networks to flood ourselves with reality TV or teen-oriented shows. Why do we need to switch to HBO or FX to get a mature, thoughtful and well-made material? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. The new media streams will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
