Shot on an impossible and budget-free program, the film was much better than you would expect, certainly much more faithful to Peter O'Donnell's books and comics than the previous two films. You can read the strip currently in reprints from Titan Books or in Comics Revue per month. It is one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most low-budget films, it takes full advantage of what it has achieved and keeps your interest. On extra DVDs, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some have criticized Tarentino for having associated his name to the film, but without him he would never have been realized. He is a fan of Modesty Blaise and has chosen a good writer and director. All in all, it's worth 8 stars.
