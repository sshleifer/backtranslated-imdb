I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted in the late 90s and only recently I had the chance to see all three parts via Netflix (a convenient service by the way). All in all, I liked this carefree, sometimes genre-challenged mini series. The story of a younger man who falls in love with an old woman seems to work and the actors are fine. Yes, it has some romantic clich√©s of running in the rain or a farewell train station, but the characters have the chance to be explored so that it doesn't seem trivial, as it would be if this were a Tom Hanks vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakula, separated from birth, does a great job to those who are hopelessly in love and the wave of desire and rejection launches the series into a payable rate. Personally, I think the series could have been made with two episodes, but that's the maximum for the debate, I suppose. Apparently, there is a sequel, and should arrive tomorrow via Netflix.
