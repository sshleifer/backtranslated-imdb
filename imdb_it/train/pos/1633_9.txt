I loved this movie when it was released in the 80s and continues to do so! I still quote classic lines like "say it again" and "you said you would have taken the balls off me". Ron Leibman was warm and very funny! Although I was underestimated and disowned by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be a treasure and a film that I would take with me if sent to a desert island! I just hope someone releases the DVD because my VHS tape is worn out! If you like old-fashioned comedy, this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It's military humor in its good and bad! Rent it if you can't own it!
