What can I say about it? It's another Hollywood horror movie with a very high budget (80 million dollars). It's not scary at all, it offers us only a few chills and a really scary sequence with a skeleton in the fireplace. A lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is as beautiful as ever, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of the Hill House is incredible, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! However I don't like the ending because it was so succulent. Check this out and shape your opinion on it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
