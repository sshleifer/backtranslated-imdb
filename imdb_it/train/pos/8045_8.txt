Finally, I started to rent DVDs by e-mail, so I could find films not available in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni and even small films, often ignored. <br /> <br /> This is a real pleasure! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to peck him like a pigeon, you always see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is a mediocre independent unbound who is hitting skates in many ways, only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and the character of Tim Busfield is realistic and unfinished. I haven't seen Busfield in 30 years, and he was fun to watch. But it was all Chris's movie. I became a fan of the genre once again. <br /> <br /> At first it is a bit slow, I admit it. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been modified. But overall, this film will delight you - male or female - because it has an honest and refreshing vision of today's relationships.
