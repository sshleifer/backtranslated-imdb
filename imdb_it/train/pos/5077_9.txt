Indian cinema represents the policemen of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the villains. Honest kids always shout at the top of their voices and fight the system while the bad cops mostly enjoy but suffer in the end. <br /> <br /> This film at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives. The direction gives an internal look to the life of an ambitious young policeman who. The music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter up to Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is slow at times and the dilemma that Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is sometimes overwritten. But I would still give this 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit.
