Ok, I saw this movie as a child and loved it. My parents never bought the film for me, but I think I'm going to buy it now. I'm a fan of animation films before 2000. Anyway, on the real review. <br /> <br /> WHAT I LIKE: There was a true portrait of heaven and hell, one of the few I saw in animated films. The character development existed! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (eg Charlie is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical but he believes that Charlie, Carface is obviously the relentless rascal, etc.). I also loved the song of King Gator. I've always loved loud, annoying, flashy guys. This song may have been random, but it was so fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could say that Charlie was all rough and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT I DON'T LIKE: The real portrait of paradise: the way Charlie reacted, "with no surprises of any sort", made it seem very boring indeed. He denied a place in heaven and STILL had to come back to it eventually. I remember a few lines of some songs like "... you can't keep a good dog down", "... we make music forever", and "... welcome to be dead", but I can't remember the majority of someone from their. The songs weren't so appealing, actually. Whippet Angel: She's annoying and that NECK! AUGH! <br /> <br /> WHAT THE PARENTS MAY LIKE: Some very scary movies (depending on the viewer) are shown during the film. Carface is rather threatening. Beer is also implicit, but not DUBBIA beer. Gambling is a key element in the film. The good boy dies. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: I LOVE this movie, even if it is sometimes a bit forgettable. The animations of the scariest children are always my favorite. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to give children a little fright from time to time. Nowadays, this probably would have been evaluated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not watch this. In addition to this, I give them 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Enjoy it!
