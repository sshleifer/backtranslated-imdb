I'm a big fan of classic movies, but I'm just getting into silent films. Many silent films do not attract my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide range as he transforms himself from a small city girl into a star who takes himself a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast-paced film with a fantastic series of cameos from some of the greatest stars of the silent era. The film immediately caught my attention and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know it doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) Actors are so skilled in their trade that few dialogue papers are needed. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It is a fast and interesting film with two of the best stars of the silent era. Add the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the list of "must see" for all classic cinema fans.
