A tour deforce! OK, the child who plays Oliver is a little too sweet! Starting from the great cinematography, the colors, the costumes and the most impressive performances, this is a must-see film. I've seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this is above all and it's a musical to use! He is a masterful Fagan, he never left his character to make a song. You never really know if you like it or not, the same feeling I had in the book. In other versions you hate it from start to finish. Bill Sykes ... when you read the book it's a bad one, and so it is in this film. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his latest film, The Gladiator based on his many beautiful performances, not to see the headliners. Music adapts to the times and mood. Who will buy this beautiful film? You should!
