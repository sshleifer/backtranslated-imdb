With the amount of actors who worked on the project they have a wide variety of casts. Beautiful CGI starship in places, BUT their green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard of Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it to get the best keying. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, with lots of trekking elements to keep it in context. BUT The idea of ​​two kissing boys makes the episode progress. I'm not homophobic but I can't help that I don't find men kissing entertain (don't worry about women). Anyway ... For a series of fans this is good stuff. With a slight improvement in their green screen, acting and some driving assessments, this series is surprising. However, I recommend this series to anyone who has ever enjoyed TNG and DS9.
