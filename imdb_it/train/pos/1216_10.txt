As a child I preferred the first Care Bear movie because it looked so dark. I always sat and watched the first one. When I got older I learned to prefer this. What I think is that this film is too dark for children, but as you get older you learn to treasure the fact that you understand it more, it doesn't look as dark as it was when you were a child. <Br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is much deeper. It could contradict the first movie, but you have to ignore the first movie to see it. The puppies are simply adorable, I rewind the 'Flying My Colors' scene. I tend to bore everyone by singing. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is fantastic! A great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I downloaded them all and that's all I hear, I'm listening to "Our Beginning", also known as "Recall" at the moment. I've always preferred this soundtrack to the premiere, even though I love the Carol Kings song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is fantastic, the animation in both films is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the moment was excellent. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not much support from other people to say that this film is fantastic, but it is. I don't think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film is about how Care Bears were born and how to defeat the Demon, Dark Heart. The end is surprising and, again, beats any "Pokemon Movie" with the problems of Care Bears Moral. Leave an effect on you. Again this film can teach everyone at all ages about morality.
