On the day of the great study system, the fiercest casting decisions were taken. Good old all the American James Stewart who appears as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. If I had played the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart also had the same problem in Mortal Storm with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was her most frequent protagonist on the screen, she made four films with her. But it is only this where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart the day he was a struggling player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend, Henry Fonda, at the time. I think only Clark Gable managed to become an American in a non-American cast in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American and therefore didn't stand out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, then you'll see a good Ernest Lubitsch film. The plot is pretty simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along. But it seems that they are carrying out a correspondence with some anonymous admirers who reveal each other. Employer Frank Morgan also suspects that Stewart is wrong about kanoodling with his wife. <br /> <br /> Even if the results are good and Frank Morgan moves away from his usual and confused, the two best players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. It is very scarce. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just as fantastic as the little worm that constantly kisses with Frank Morgan. You really hate people like this, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are in office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that he pays a lot of time.
