In the year 1985 (my year of birth) Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl, Celie (debut role for Whoopi Goldberg), whose life followed in difficult times. The story begins in the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. He gave birth to two children for his father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widower puts his eyes on Nettie but his father gives him Celie. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men and above all being an African American woman their rights are below zero. The story of Celie is a true story of survival. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a masterpiece and underrated film by Spielberg. It should make it more dramatic that "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are a good idea. <br /> <br /> The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is best known as a funny comedian, but Celie's introductory role is a remarkable word that can really pull off the heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly bad "Mister". I've never seen him in such a wicked role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is as bright as a volitional Sofia. <br /> <br /> Attention! Get ready to have a number of fabrics with you when you watch this movie. You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have close relationships with your brothers like I did with my sister. <br /> <br /> The great ones applaud Mr. Spielberg!
