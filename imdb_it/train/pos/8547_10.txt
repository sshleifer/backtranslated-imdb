A lot of people hated this movie, but I blame two facts: 1 - They want it to be too similar to the first pair of American Pie movies. and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> What I found was the best of all six, and I love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I'll say it, but then what comedy for teenagers is NOT? Road Trip, Dirty Deed etc etc, they are all incredibly predictable, but damn funny anyway! I say it's worth watching, I love it, I find it hilarious. Just don't look at it while you compare it to the first because it's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> After seeing Naked Mile and this, it became obvious that all the American Pie movies were about, and only about, Stiflers. Which is FINE on my part. <br /> <br /> Look. To enjoy. Love. xD
