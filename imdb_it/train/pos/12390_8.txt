A bizarre horror film full of famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later on TV "Flamingo Road") as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a rubbery smile who plans to pay for her attempted suicides by defending the door of the Hell! Raines' modeling scenes are very well captured, atmospheric music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is as charming as Cristina's friend, but when Raines moves into an ugly Brooklyn Heights stone (inhabited by a blind priest at top floor), things really start to cook. Neighbors, including fantastically evil Burgess Meredith and vicious couple Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, are a devilish lot, and Eli Wallach is a lot of fun as a cunning police detective. The film is almost a cross-pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the best-selling book by Jeffrey Konvitz, "The Sentinel" is incredibly spooky, full of shocks very well brought by director Michael Winner, who mounts a thoughtful downbeat that ends with skill. *** 1/2 from ****
