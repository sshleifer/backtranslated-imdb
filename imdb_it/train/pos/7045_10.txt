This movie definitely has a nice thumb up. They are witty jokes and even his stereotyped and occasional derogatory opinions on the people of Eastern Europe have set me up for most of the film. The plot is 100% intelligent and original and will make you guess throughout the movie. The only person who impressed me most in this film was Hilary Duff. It is clear and simple to see that he has made a leap of faith outside of the "chick-flick" genre to which he is accustomed. His accent is excellent and his acting was surprisingly clear and well executed. It's the best performance I've ever seen at Hilary and I've seen most of his films. His character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe" and this is evident in some of his ways and in the song, "I want to blow you ... ... ... up". She also feels sorry for her, as her performance really grabs you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack made me laugh throughout the film with her sometimes slapstick humor, but also her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you laugh all the time. I highly recommend this movie.
