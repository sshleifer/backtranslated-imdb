This is one of the most adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some funny dialogues and funny characters to break the tension of some disturbing moments. There is the usual blonde "ballerina" vamp (what does Serling's passion have in store for that kind of character, such that he continues to appear in various episodes?) And other assorted characters, but he is the "old" of Jack Elam that totally steals the show. I consider this the fun and carefree version of "The Monsters Are Two on Maple Street" or, perhaps, a 20-minute parody of "The Thing's" Twilight Zone. On another note: I thought the young lover of the episode could be someone who eventually switched to other things - he looked familiar - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" has disappeared after only two TV credits to his name.
