Good luck finding this movie to watch - it hasn't been released on tape or DVD yet. I saw it coming out in the early 1970s, I was lucky enough to capture it thanks to the conservation efforts of the American film industry, and it still has some tangible moments that have stayed with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat accurate comments here. As an outgoing director shortly after the rising success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N was told that he managed the effort at low cost in the best possible way, and certainly shows in the wandering and meander that he could use some makeover. But it is also a memorable icon for his time: the very intense clashes of university sports of the late 1960s, student movements, sexual revolutions and more. <br /> <br /> Why see this movie? In some scenes it was probably a home run: the lively male bond in the showers after the game; Karen Black's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it's the first use of a word I'd never seen before in a movie; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity in general. There are probably others that I'm omitting. <br /> <br /> Find a nice surprise for a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren has just emerged from his blue UCLA uniform and is preparing for a dark blue uniform; Robert Towne - actor; and a lot of people just have fun. <br /> <br /> Now: any link between Harry Gittes's last name, Robert Towne and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> Get a "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
