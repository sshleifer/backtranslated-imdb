To correctly evaluate this film, you need to think about the genre that should be: children. They had more guidelines to follow to make this film (which means they couldn't get away with the humor and language of the 1st), take everything that was fun and enjoyable to watch in this movie. The sequels usually make me nervous, but this did quite well by itself. Knowing that he didn't have Fraiser's main power like George, they capitalized on humor and I think Showeman did quite well as a protagonist. The plot is easy to follow and maybe sometimes campy adapts well to a younger audience, if you want to see a movie and hope for the academy's honors, this is not the case, but if you want to see a simple, fun and full of energy movie you would make a good choice with this.
