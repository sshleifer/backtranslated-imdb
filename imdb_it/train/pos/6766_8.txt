Perhaps the most compelling and intelligent of the police cop films is "Where the Sidewalks Ends" by Otto Preminger, from a truly excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel "Night Cry" by Frank Rosenberg ... <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the honest and tenacious policewoman in New York, always in trouble with her superiors, because he likes his strong arm methods as much as he hates scammers ... When he hits someone, his knuckles hurt ... And the man he wants to hit is a bad smooth (Gary Merrill) who points to the title. "Why are you always trying to push me into the sewer?" he asks Andrews. "I have as much on the pavement as you do." <br /> <br /> Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery of being the son of a thief ... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use his own illegal methods to destroy them, and the search for justice has become flawed in private revenge ... <br /> <br /> From a touch of unique irony to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are once again united, and Andrews now seems to play the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, knocked down by his work, by economic criminals ... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect ... The murder it is accidental, the victim without value, yet it is a crime that knows that it can break it or send it to prison ... <br /> <br /> Using his knowledge of the police procedure, he covers his part in the crime, false plant clues and tries to involve a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating on the case ... The double tension of the fact that the larger case is concluded without implication in the murder, is magnificently maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfactory, and in no way a compromise ... <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best detective films of the 50s, with curious moral values, also one of the best in Preminger ... <br /> <br /> Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting angles pretentious room and particular bizarre touches to express his suspense in realism ...
