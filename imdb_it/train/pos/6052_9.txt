Highly recommended !! <br /> <br /> A well written and entertaining film that everyone will enjoy out there with a sense of humor !!!. Try it, it's nice to see an independent English movie rather than keep it against the big established studios !! Definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this film that I'm sure many people will be able to relate to. You will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the excellent soundtrack. I particularly enjoyed Orb's Vietnam version of Jimmy Cliff and The Tower of London's Freebird. <br /> <br /> Give it away ............ you won't be disappointed.
