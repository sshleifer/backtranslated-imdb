Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful photograph, I think not. This film wasn't too terrible, but it wasn't much better than average. The main story that dealt with highly immoral adolescents should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was ... should have really entered instead of basically scraping the surface with "because mom says we can't". Some parts should have been abandoned altogether or reworked to have more importance for the difficult situation of the two main characters. A couple of times I wondered if the writer / director was a fan of George Lucas' classic Graffiti. Not that it's wrong to be a fan of that movie, but to make your movie sometimes it seems so, I mean, come on! The worst thing was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, I mean come on! It was the only one, in one or two ways, that actually had a southern accent. (Have a good listen, he was there even if his character came from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she was the star that others could follow and we would have had a more authentic film. Oh well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist, too. Sin. Overall, I give a B- and this is a bit generous because I'm partial with Mrs. Amick.
