49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with a fever Eleven-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. His health progressively worsens when a series of mysterious "blackouts" squeeze it. In each of these episodes he dreams of a house in a desolate field, with only a sick and disabled boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) who lives there. When a dark, unknown danger threatens his idyllic "paperhouse", Marc's life is jeopardized. His life is also in danger as these dreams reflect his state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Haunting first debut by British director Bernard Rose. Taken from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, she leaves behind many other "original" fictional works. Whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is difficult to give it the mix of fairy tale and reality to make it work as a movie. The director Rose successfully captures the appearance of children's fantasy world along with a darkness that tries to usurp them. <br /> <br /> Feverishly marked by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with expert time jumping out of place. Most thrillers are very sloppy in this very important aspect of frightening the public in not knowing what the next scene will be. I also like the way it captures the suspense and never lets it go or falters slowly in the next sequence of events. Furthermore, his mastery in placing objects inside the frame (as in his P.O.V photos) gives the cinematography an additional dimension that would otherwise not seem to have. Only in Europe will you find places as disturbing as those presented here: the solitary house, the fields, the coastal cities, the lookout tower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose would have followed this film with "Candyman" (1992), a real gem of the horror of the "thinking person" and the favorite of the cult horror film in good faith.
