I really like this movie. It has a wonderful harmony between the actors and tells a story that is rather universal, the story of the prodigal son. The aspect that I like most was the way the bathtub was more of a background for the story. While the father told his son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and the bathroom became an almost sacred ritual. The water was so scarce that a simple bathroom had deep depths and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall the film was very effective. There were times, however, when he became "too" sweet ... bordering sickly during the park recital. But overall, I highly recommend this movie.
