As a Westerner looking at the point of view of another culture and the tradition of marriage, I found Just Married charming and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the mutual accommodation of parents is difficult, especially in this modern era. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor and a new perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika, who met only once and are now on a five-day honeymoon. As has already been said, it is difficult to believe in this age of cellular phones that such an archaic habit as an arranged marriage still takes place. We see the embarrassment that this young couple feels when they meet the first night and how they try to create a bond, even if they don't know each other. We see different points of view on marriage and commitment presented by other couples even on vacation, for a couple of forty years married to others still uncertain to make a marital commitment. There is song, witty dialogue, moving moments, mixing and comparison of new ways and traditions. Watching the film with subtitles definitely loses part of the essentiality of the story, yet it is still a pleasure to watch. Granted part of the plot is a bit trivial and the bus accident a little pulled out and invented; however, the film generally deserves to be seen.
