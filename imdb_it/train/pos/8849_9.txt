The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently he has his act together) and Hank (clearly he doesn't have his act together) need money. Andy proposes a scheme to obtain a dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie offers. This is a layered, rollercoaster ride full of blood that knows exactly what it's doing. As a drama / thriller, I would happily compare it to "No Country For Old Men". While both films have a wide range of dramatic and thrilling films, "Devil" is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and darker movie that you can really admire, while 'Devil' is a little more fun. There is certainly less violence in "Devil" than in "No Country". Even acting offers. Ethan Hawke, sometimes in wood, brings nervousness, sweating and deer in the headlights: look at the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the most difficult scenes in the film and is quickly becoming the actor, whoever you think can do anything. <br /> <br /> There's really not much wrong with this movie. Jump back and forth without being confused. The events are out of control, but the film never does: the script (from the first timer Kelly Masterson), the direction (the veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing remain tight as a drum. In many categories, this is a quality material, although perhaps films like "The Departed" and "No Country" have squeezed this out of the limelight. If you liked them you will like them.
