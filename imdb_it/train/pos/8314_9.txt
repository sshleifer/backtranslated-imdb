The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous group of girls. In their efforts, the older sister meets a drug dealer and a street dealer called Satin, whom her sister chases because she believes she is the "great moment" that will give her everything she has always thought she wanted from life. Although he may be accused of killing her, he only kills his spirit and his will to live, after which he becomes a drug addict and eventually dies from an overdose. The story is not about street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix, then threatens him, it is about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies of life, as interpreted in song and style and the character that is it was life in the times for young women trying to be "discovered" in those days.
