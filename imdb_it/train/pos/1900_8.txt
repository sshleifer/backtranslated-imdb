The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his short career in the 1981 movie ARTHUR, a lively and moving story that generates warm smiles, big belly laughs and occasional tears if you're in the right mood. Moore received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "runs cars, plays tennis, caresses women, but has weekends free and is his own boss". Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a passionate girl from the company named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry) who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) an actress / actress from Queens who steals ties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the most entertaining shows of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his impeccable role as Art's butler and best friend, Hobson, whose contempt for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other fun contributions by Barney Martin in the role of Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan and Geraldine Fitzgerald's father as Arthur's crazy grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye to comedy by a top-level director named Steve Gordon, who, unfortunately, died the following year. There was also a forgettable sequel some years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.
