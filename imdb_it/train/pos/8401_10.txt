Love Trap is an independent film "not to be missed". When I sat down to watch the movie, I entered with low expectations, but I left a blessing. The story is poetic, substantial and creative. The writer pushes you further and further along each scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that everyone can identify with. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and on what I consider love. The film shows what love really is, action not emotion. I was also struck by the quality of the film and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two great compliments and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
