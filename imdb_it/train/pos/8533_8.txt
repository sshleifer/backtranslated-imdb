This film is more Lupine then, especially from Funimation. Otherwise the bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very similar to Comic (which is what everything about Lupine the 3rd is based on). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness for women to try to get something out of it. The last bit is not so bad, he is with another woman, but of course Fujiko is still the number one. <br /> <br /> Many other Lupine films are more Family with evil words and then Lupine. Any good Lupine fan, I think he will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was listening to so many bad things about this movie). It could be a little better without the little animations running during the credits (they make it a bit soft) but overall, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few I would watch again in Lupine III movies.
