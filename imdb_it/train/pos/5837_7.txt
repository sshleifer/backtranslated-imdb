With Oliver Hardy tormented by the sound of horns, bells, telephones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson recommends peace and quiet and a diet based on goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel offers a great solution, living on a docked boat, so that the salty sea air can help Ollie get all the rest she needs. It is a great premise for all the crazy elves to follow, since the boat is left adrift by the hungry goat, and a convict on the run (Richard Cramer) gets in line for the journey. <br /> <br /> I took a kick of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn test factory - "Silence While Men Are Working". The first story in the boys' apartment presents a series of mishaps between plumbers and domestic appliances, with Stan making a banana inside a banana. Laurel has a couple of big lines in the picture, like "We must have been separated," but what rolled me was her response to the criminal ship on board - "Self-preservation is the ultimate law of averages" - precisely! <br /> <br /> I am not a great student of Laurel and Hardy films like so many on this forum, all I know is that I enjoyed it as a child and found them as funny today as they were in my youth. At that point, "Saps At Sea" offers a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well ahead on the road to hornomania.
