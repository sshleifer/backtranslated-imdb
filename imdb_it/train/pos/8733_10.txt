When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out on Video after being released in theaters, I saw a trailer for what it said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw it, I knew it would be a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life as a Toy Story is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) raises up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich like You Hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim like you're about to shoot! I'm going to shoot! I just died laughing in that scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar movie ever! I don't know how you could hate a Pixar movie! I think they're all good movies! Good work PIXAR!
