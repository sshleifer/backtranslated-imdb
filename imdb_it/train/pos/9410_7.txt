I liked this movie. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. Sometimes it was fun, but actually it wasn't fun at all. If I expected it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but upon entering without expectations, I found it amusing and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less interested in the satire of capital or labor, and more in the basic story of a man struggling for his invention. A man who is less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it realized and put into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in exchange for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; I compare it to The Fountainhead.
