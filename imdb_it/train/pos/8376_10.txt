One of the best films around. Yes, perhaps photography was not the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and very funny. One of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone who loves creative and imaginative films. After the third world war and fighting in giant robots, the actors gave a great performance and were worth it. The sets are not fantastic, but simple and have worked for the general appearance of the film. This film is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Watch it because I've loved it since it came out. Not a traditional film and not like anything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It is a fantastic and very funny sight.
