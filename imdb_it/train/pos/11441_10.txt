As a person looking for a life as a 'professional' person with an income supported by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Administration, my sanity was always spasmodically supported by external indulgences in more artistic things. My post-graduate classes have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and art drawings that also included screen printing. <br /> <br /> I also keep healthy with jogging, walking and, recently, trips to remote destinations in California and neighboring states like Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and walking approaches the earth with time to stop and watch, listen and even take pictures or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In that context I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally struck by the documentary content of the artist Andy Goldsworthy and the skills and fluidity of the director / cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. In reality I could not separate the art of Goldsworthy with the photographic path of Riedelsheimer. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
