At first, the thought of Sarah Silverman who had her show worried me. The films in which she appeared were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see his true colors shine in this Comedy Central gem. I could put her on a par with Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very similar to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. <br /> <br /> The only downfall of this show is its supporting cast. His sister's character is good; Sometimes funny, but after all it meant not stealing Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely comparable in comparison. <br /> <br /> I'm glad, however, that Comedy Central gave Sarah the chance to show her unique and crazy sense of herself and humor.
