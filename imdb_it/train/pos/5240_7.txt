Some acting was a little suspicious. I remember that Asswipe Alexander Walker (an Evening Standard critic, yes OK, now dead) launched into a farce about this film saying it was a disgrace to portray NI Protestants as murderers. Now, compared to all the NI Protestants, this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were very loyal) and wandering around Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers at all. my main complaint about this film is that it does not show any ray of light or hope, it is all misfortune and darkness, I mean that the child must eventually die. Perhaps this sounds trivial, but could have taken the fact that not all Prods and tiags are bad or all good.
