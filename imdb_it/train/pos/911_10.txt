In my opinion VIVAH is the best film of 2006, coming from a director who was successful during his career. I don't like romantic movies these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. Anyway, I've seen this movie three times now ... and believe me it's a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional path, showing simple characters in a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The film entertains in all ways as it can reflect on what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya did his homework well and described a very realistic story in a very well done film. <br /> <br /> Several sequences in this film immediately capture your interest: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of her and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to visit her - that is a shy Shahid who doesn't know exactly what to talk about but pulling a decent conversation. Also the naive nature of Amrita, the limited eye contact, the timid characteristics and the sweet response to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional rupture of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of the daughter-in-law of another rather than her beloved uncle's niece. <br /> <br /> Clearly the film belongs to Amrita Rao to the end. The actress plays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you can't imagine anyone else replacing her. She is beautiful throughout the film and perfectly portrays a traditional innocent and shy girl. Shahid Kapoor also performs brilliantly. It offers a promising performance and shows that it is not inferior to Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a film by Sooraj R. Barjatya. In reality Shahid and Amrita form a cute couple on the screen, without a shadow of a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). <br /> <br /> Overall, VIVAH offers what it promised, a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film has high-level performance, excellent history and great music to satisfy the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It's a must see!
