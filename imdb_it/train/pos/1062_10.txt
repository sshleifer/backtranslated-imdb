I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba does a great job. Michael Weatherly also does a fantastic job, as does the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful plots and their stunts are incredible. It's like watching a 1-hour movie. Definitely worth looking at.
