This is a must for fans of independent films, but it also holds up well against traditional films. I think we have the stuff of the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects, and apparently they used ambient lighting (digital video shooting). Yet this film catches you and never gives up. The script is quite bizarre, but the actors and the director do it with complete realism. He has humor, he has intrigue and he has pathos, and everything works together. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense to describe the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson on how to make a low budget movie that really works, see this. <br /> <br /> - Oh yes, it's really REALLY fun. <br /> <br />
