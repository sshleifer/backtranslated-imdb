I saw this movie at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the red ball. Both films are similar in their dream quality. Most of the film involves a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is away at school. A cat enters the room where the fish and its bowl are, and begins to distrust its "prey" with caution. The boy begins his return home from school and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. The fish becomes agitated by the presence of the cat and eventually jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly approaches the fish, takes it gently with its legs and returns it to its bowl. The boy happily returns to his fish, none wiser. <br /> <br /> The finish is surprising both for its irony and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could have recovered the technical skill in 1959 - it looks more like a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look at it - you won't let it be disappointed! And if you * find * it, let me know so I can have a copy too!
