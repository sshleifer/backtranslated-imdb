It's a bit crazy, but I recorded both, this German version of "Anna Christie" from MGM, and the English one from TCM ... but I got to see it first, because I heard that many people thought it was better than the version English. <br /> <br /> Without having seen the other, I can't compare them, but it's still a great first talkie, with a performance from the heart of Garbo. She is very beautiful in this film, her face shines everywhere, especially when the cameraman William Daniels gets those fantastic close-ups. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular MGM stuff made up at that time seems very similar to the French or German expressionist films of the thirties, but was directed by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who had directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss". <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and offers an absolutely believable performance as Anna's beloved, the hard, hot, sailor, who is only a child in the man's body. Hans Junkermann also does a very nice performance, as does Anna and Salka Viertel's alcoholic father, as a good old and inexpensive dancer. <br /> <br /> In all a beautiful experience, because it is the only film where you can hear Garbo speak in a foreign language ... 'like all the other films he did both in Sweden and in Germany, they were during the silent era. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
