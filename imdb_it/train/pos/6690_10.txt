Mystery Men is one of those movies that gets more fun over time. There is a naive innocence and "kindness" in the characters. It has become part of our family "culture" and we often mention the characters. It's my favorite movie of the last two years. My children are 13 and 11 years old and we all love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We also love the Galaxy Quest and Monty Python movies. Okay, we're not talking intellectual here, just a family bond!
