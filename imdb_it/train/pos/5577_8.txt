I haven't laughed so much for a movie in a long time. The trash that Hollywood has put out lately brings me to a wall! This was definitely cool and witty. If you look at the population figures for the assessments, only a few women voted! I don't want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw this went to their computers to evaluate it and gave it a poor score, why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this film because of its real value of humor and not because it's harmful to men ... it could easily be a nominal "7" movie!
