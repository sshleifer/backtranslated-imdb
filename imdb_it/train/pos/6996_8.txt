This film was a great film about something that concerns us all. I know I've come across this personally many times. Thankfully, Will Smith threw himself on the social question of text messaging while driving. People, don't do it. An hour and forty-five minutes are not enough for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw away my phone after the movie. I was glad to see the other people in the theater saw the message and downloaded their phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, have them look at this vital public service announcement about text messaging while you are driving or they could kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
