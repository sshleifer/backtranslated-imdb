This film is not just about shooting a school, it has never been seen. But this simply adds the power that this film has. It's about people and how they deal with the tragedy. I know it was shown to students who survived the Columbine shoot and provided a sense of closure for many of them. The acting is superb. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I highly recommend this film to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about this after seeing it. It provokes discussion not only of school shootings, but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a tear-jerker, but it's worth it and I'll watch it several times
