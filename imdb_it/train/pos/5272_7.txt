Deodato gives us slightly shocking moments and a film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Absolutely a classic in its particular kind of way. This film offers a refreshing look at the barbarians. If you have the chance to watch this movie, do it. You will surely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's funny or something banal like this, but because it's so ugly that it goes off the other side and becomes good, even if maybe not clean, fun.
