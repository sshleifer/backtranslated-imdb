Hi to all my names, Larissa, I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old I look curly and knocked on my socks to have watched that movie for a long time, in fact about 30 minutes ago I just finished watching it. Alisan Porter is a really good actor and I love that movie. It's so fun when it comes to cards. Every time I watch the movie at the end of it, I cry, so I said, I know I'm only 13 but it's such a touching story that it's really weird. Alisan is 25 years old now. Every time I watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after doing it and when you look at it and find out how old the person in the film is it's really fierce how they can go from one age to another The next. Like Harry Potter. That film was also great, but Daniel was about 12 in the first movie and I was about 11 years old. How could he go from 12 to 16 years in about 4 years and I only have 13. I am not sure that he 16 years old I think he's almost 18 but it's weird when you watch a movie and the year after about 4 years when they were alone 1 in the last one. I'm not sure I have a great imagination and I like to revoke it. I am a computerized person, but I also like to do many things for children. I'm very clever like Sue hedgehog in the film, but one thing I don't like about the movie is when that guy calls the adoptive house and makes the hedgehogs get taken away I would kill that guy if he really did it in real life. Well, I'm going to stop writing, I know that sometimes I write a lot, but the kids have a lot of things that need to come out and if they don't the kids will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
