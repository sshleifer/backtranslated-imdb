We all create our reality or not? This is the main question behind this highly original and masterfully elaborated examination of the illusory nature of reality. Combining Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual cavil of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise manages to address the rather cerebral question of "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?", And turn it into 100 captivating and entertaining minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer grappling with his script, "The Sea That Thinks". As he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his computer session, which writes the script. In a short time he is stuck in a swirling enigma in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a mischievous sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of surprising visual tricks that address the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaff's film challenges audiences at different levels to wonder if all we see or touch or taste is really what it seems to be, or if our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is simply a trick played by us our senses Note: AFTER watching the movie, check out the fun movie website.
