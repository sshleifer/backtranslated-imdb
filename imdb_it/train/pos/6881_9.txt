How can a movie that features Curtis Mayfield's song be bad? He can not! The Groove Tube is a series of scatological black-out sketches that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympics. The highs, (Koko the clown, the easy lubricant recipe) exceed the minimum (a too long "The Dealers"), but even the bass are fun. The best thing is Ken Shapiro's manic dance along a crowded Manhattan sidewalk. (This is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Definitely dated now, but at the moment The Groove Tube was irreverent, bold, shameless and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro has made this little cult success, then 7 years later he made the opening bomb of Christmas Day, Modern Problems (although I liked it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. (It could play the drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube It remains for me a never-ending burst of positive energy, a film that at 26 years from my first vision, still gives me real joy!
