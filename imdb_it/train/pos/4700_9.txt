I could not believe the low rating 5.6 on IMDb on Johnny Dangerously the moment I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as possible. Seriously, to get such a low rating, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very superficial mind. If you don't like humorous gestures, don't look at them! Combining absurd humor, a very good narrative and an exceptional rhythm given by the multiple racing gags, this film has entered my DVD collection. And this without mentioning the visual farces incorporated here and there and, of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite favorite crime films. <br /> <br /> I showed this film to a lot of people and, having been presented without specific expectations (except maybe watching a comedy), the mental state in which you should watch every movie in my opinion - everyone loved it . Okay, it's not long to look at and there are absolutely no slowdowns in the evolution of history, which I think is really simple. Certainly not perfect, some gags are a bit short, but no film is perfect, especially when considering the opinions of others. This is why I voted for this movie 9 out of 10. This film is in my opinion a precursor as "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well thought comedies. Today they are increasingly absurd as they reduce thought and ingenuity. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people think they are understood correctly, if at all. As a last word, I would like to say: look at it yourself, don't follow Joe's sentence and if you don't like it, then you'll know that it wasn't good for your tastes, which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion.
