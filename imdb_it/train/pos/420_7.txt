This film features the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, are the main characters. <br /> <br /> As the Civil War closes, Lincoln cites his concern that the country's dynamism would have improved if people followed the council, "Go west, young man," which, fortunately, the film did not erroneously attribute to Horace Greeley, as did many others. But then, he is murdered, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich by selling arms to American Indians. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock, interacting with a little boy, while a steamboat is loading into a basin along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives the boy, calling him an "Arkansas toothpick", which was actually a different kind of knife, although both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks closely at the photographs and paintings of the royal man. Cody has just married and is taking his bride to the old West to settle down. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at their destination, they meet Calamity Jane, who has a crush on Hickock. He looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is this your mopsy?" The line was the one that caused some problems at the table of Hayes, since a definition of "mopsy" was a prostitute. Demille wanted the line to come in, and one of his helpers pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books on Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked censorship to identify "the rabbit of sick virtue". It worked; the line remained inside. <br /> <br /> The Indians were becoming restless, partly because of the superior weapons obtained by the agent of the eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help explore the area, so that the troops could safely arrive in a besieged area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check on the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Calamity Jane is captured and Hickock is captured trying to save her. They are taken to the leader, and although neither of them would speak, the torture applied to Hickock interrupts the willpower of Calamity Jane, and she tells the road that Cody is using. <br /> <br /> The two are released, and Hickock joins Cody and his forces, partly to warn that they are walking in a trap. With the help of Hickok, they hold off the Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to chase the marathon runners and eventually takes them prisoner. While they are waiting for the authorities, Hickock is killed by a shot in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> In the film there are numerous historical anomalies, but retains the flavor of the legend. Good enough for the 1930s.
