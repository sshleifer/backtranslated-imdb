Once again demonstrating his extraordinary versatility, John Turturro plays the introspective Russian chess genius who is preparing for a return tournament and tightens an unlikely relationship with a resident colleague (Emily Watson) in an Italian hotel of the 1920s. They fall in love, to the horror of his social-alpinist mother (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story, whose chess shine could make it look cerebral. But despite its origins in a Nabakov story, it certainly isn't. The romantic elements and the sense of time and place have beaten the hands of psychological analysis. John Turturro, appeared in "Barton Fink", "Brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" shows that he is not dependent on Coen Bros films to assert his stature.
