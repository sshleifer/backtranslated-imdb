This is at the top of my list of the most hysterically entertaining shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I lost half of the lines. This highlights Izzard as the brilliant comedian he is. What I particularly like is that it never seems to "stun" the material for its audience. His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together like a performance rather than a series of gags. Thumb up.
