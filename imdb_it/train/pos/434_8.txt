Nice character development in a rather interesting environment. Being a male, I probably am not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a good job of establishing the Victorian restrictive environment from the start. It is not as gloomy as in reality and the treatment of women was probably even harder. What makes this going is a wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" with which they compete. Once they come out of the rain and burst from the cobwebs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I liked about this movie is that it didn't go for an economic comedy when it could have. He didn't try to teach us a lesson. The people who seem absolutely without merit are really well developed human beings who can see the light. I had a small problem with the character of Alfred Molina who had such an epiphany so quickly, but, in this world, it had to happen. Good acting all around with something positive that takes place in the life of some pretty good people.
