The main aspect of this film that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life like a game of chess. So many people have seen this movie and just don't understand, and I don't understand why. While watching this film, I was taken on a private journey that drove me crazy. I will try to explain it without spoilers, but to be warned, I talk about things that happen in the film. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoilers **** Be Forewarned! **** <br /> <br /> His is a life of "big moves" against "small moves". He chooses Natalia as his queen, and he and she behave like his aunt described for the first time the king and queen and their moves when he introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen to the description carefully. <br /> <br /> When someone asks a question, he returns to the past as if he were reviewing the previous moves. (By the way, flashbacks are beautifully illuminated.) Flashbacks are also quite interesting, because they give not only your child's point of view, but also the other person's point of view. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> Various characters become his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their enlightening actions on who is on the side they are doing. Even their placement in a scene is essential to understand what is happening. Well done. <br /> <br /> I will no longer comment on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but I hope this illuminates what is actually happening in the end. <br /> <br /> This film constantly works on many levels, and that's why I approve it. It was a pleasure and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess and characters treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
