I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality to this comment. Also, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is tragically sad to say that that film bears a resemblance to my life that it is so amazing that it is really scary. The rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how people who have been in situations like this act and react in their later lives. <br /> <br /> This could not be a work of fiction; it had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testimony of how beautiful the film was is demonstrated by the fact that, although it was one of the best films I've ever seen, looking at my life portrayed on the silver screen was such an experience painfully painful that I will never see it again. <br /> <br /> But I warmly endorse it to everyone else as a chance to peer into the soul of another human being to the extent that you've probably never tried it before or never. I know for sure, because that is my soul that you will be observing.
