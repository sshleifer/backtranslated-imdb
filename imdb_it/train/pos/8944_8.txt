Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second screen pairing (after the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo, released earlier that year). This was Stewart's last film as a romantic protagonist, given that at fifty he was considered too old to play that role. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak who is attracted to a mortal starring James Stewart. She casts a spell on him and he falls madly in love with her. I liked the film and its cast. The film at the time was a moderate success that was nominated for a Golden Globe for best comedy film. GimmeClassics
