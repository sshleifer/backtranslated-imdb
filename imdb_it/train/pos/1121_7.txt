Here is a real weirdo for you. He begins with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower scene, on campus, then becomes more insane when several coed and their doofy boyfriends head south for Spring Break. The problem begins when they drive into the redneck county ruled by the murderous sheriff Dean. One of the college cutie wanders in the woods, witness to a sheriff's murder and has his head open. Then it's time to snatch the MACON COUNTY LINE-time while Dean chases, traps and massacres the thoughtless witnesses one by one. Tony March is on target like the evil Dean. The general tone of the film is really disturbing. The ending is so abrupt that you almost think the director has finished the film; it is also a study in despair. DARK GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists around the world.
