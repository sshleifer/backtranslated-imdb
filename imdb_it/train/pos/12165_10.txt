Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations in which you end up laughing out loud at the exact moment; and just when you understand that you shouldn't laugh, you've already reached the peak of the resonance of the voice; and as you look around at the ghostly, white faces with their mouths open and their eyes veiled, you feel a penetrating pain that starts in the pit of your stomach and suddenly cheers your throat and ... well, you get the point. <br /> <br /> But despite all his unpleasant and punching faces, Frownland, it's really an extraordinary job that, after seeing the disorderly disorder of a main character and all his pathetic problems and setbacks, makes you want scratch your eyes and at the same time, you feel deeply sorry for him. <br /> <br /> It would have been much easier for me to get out of the Ronald Bronstein film, but for a fool The reason, I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the gritty irritation that the film has from to offer. If someone sets you on fire, you usually want to put him out: Stop! Drop! And Roll! But with this film, you want to see the flame slowly envelop your whole body. You endure pain - perhaps out of spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can't even try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, mainstream cinema will never let this movie come to a theater near you. But if you have the chance to take it, get ready: bring a bag for dogs.
