With all the violence on TV and in local news, it's refreshing to have a show that has no violence or language for adults, yet it's still fun. My kids can't wait to follow us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all like Elton Brown. We like to learn the background of the main ingredient, vegetables and unique seasonings. Let's play at home to guess who the winner will be. <br /> <br /> It is a great time for entertainment as well as information. Best of all in our hectic life, it's an hour that the family spends together.
