They've got me since the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy place similar to Mayberry with a slight difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is the spoiler. Not like I didn't understand in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people are trying to keep it good, but it's an uphill battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Thin. Sneaky. It doesn't always look bad. Most of the time he is a hero. All owe him a great favor, because he often creates a calamity and saves them from it. So every time you think someone might eventually, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage him. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were out in the woods in a hut and some guys with guns decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson on evil. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) was hesitant to shoot him. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had a half conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot them by now. If he had a true conscience, he would never have become a criminal. Then he started calling him Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He was mocking the criminals. And of course he kept 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times. And obviously he had complete control at all times. They really favored Satan. <br /> <br /> Very excellent performance. it was one of my favorite horror programs of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> This is a good company.
