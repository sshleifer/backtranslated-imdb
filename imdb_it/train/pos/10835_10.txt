I love this movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and still find engaging. Congratulations!! I believe that everyone involved in the making of the film and the script should be proud of themselves. It's so dull, you feel like you're watching a real band. I'd like to see more movies like this. I'm glad they didn't choose the famous Hollywood stars in this movie because it probably wouldn't work. And although Billy Connolly is fairly well known, he was really involved in the role and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it. Congratulations again, I truly believe that this film deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene ..... well, what can I say !!!!
