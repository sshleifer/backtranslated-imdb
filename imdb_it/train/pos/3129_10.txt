This is one of the best reunion specials ever, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying and having fun while they did it. The profound commitment in detail is surprising, in particular taking up the atmosphere of the 1960s, the Batcave set, Wayne Manor, the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes deserves your time, and is a pleasure for all fans of the classic "Batman" television series of the 1960s. I note that the "Batman" clips come from the film, and not from the series itself, probably due to legal restrictions. We hope the three seasons of the show are imminent on DVD.
