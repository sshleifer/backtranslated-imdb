This film is scary because you can find yourself relating to the ideas they have and remembering other people they say and having similar ideas make this movie haunting and well done .... Camra style is not shakey to indicate that it takes you out of the movie like blair witch it only adds to the raw "real" feeling of the film that makes it.
