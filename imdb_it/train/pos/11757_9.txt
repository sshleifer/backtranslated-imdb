Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play 30-year-olds who put their marra in jeopardy by deciding (Russell somehow reluctantly) to see their heartbreaking bond with Bakersfield's rivals years later. Williams is fine, but Russell is as exceptional as the legendary quarterback Tao Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a pleasant and attractive turn as Williams's wife, who could live without this revenge. It is worth watching the movie just to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
