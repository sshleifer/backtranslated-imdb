Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing interpretation of the slums of Tokyo. Kurosawa stretches for a style that was, in my opinion, his antithesis, that is, I feel like Kurosawa wanted to take a picture of Ozu. Poorly stimulated, ill-conceived, this film is a rare disaster in this body of excellent work. While Ikiru, although banal and depressing, was still interesting and well structured, and while Stray Dog painted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy or boring, do desu ka den has all the gloom that can be expected with its content, with none of the redeeming qualities of previous Kurosawa images. <br /> <br /> Attention, this is not a film for which Kurosawa should be judged.
