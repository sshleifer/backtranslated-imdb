Scanner II: The new order is as good as the classic David Cronenberg scanner, Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, hence their eleven-year interval between the two films. The film captures the style of Scanners which is a good thing, it would not be a scanner without a head explosion, so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that is just as horrible as the first. Scanner II: The New Order has some other fancy gory scenes that are done well. The plot of Scanners II: The New Order is a new version of the series because it uses scanners as a supervisory force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named David Kellum discovers that he is used and decides to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Scanner II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's classic science fiction Scanners and should be seen. Check it. 10/10
