Rather annoying that the reviewers continue to compare it to Planet Earth ... Obviously * Planet Earth is better - it has much more than the same. The Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series and, as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. But it is not comparable to something like this. <br /> <br /> As a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature length), it surpasses practically everything you see in your entire life (unless you choose to cross the Earth in helicopters with long-range cameras) for years and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth, which - let it do - is unlikely). <br /> <br /> On the narrative: yes, everyone in the UK - including a lot of me - adores David Attenborough, and there are few excuses for not being here to tell, but this deserves to double a star or three. He wasn't a presenter on Planet Earth, just a storyteller, and I'm sure he's modest and kind enough to realize that anything that involves more viewers is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overcome by his fear, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree. Those who love it (ie all) will / should go and see a Planet Earth purchase. So three applauses for his film release, and a great boooo for anyone who is cheap enough to buy it on DVD rather than on the Planet Earth box set. But as works of art people are not in competition here. <br /> <br /> The Earth is big enough for both.
