I've loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell plays Elvis, just as it moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes he is afraid of what he looks, acts and talks like the real Elvis. Thankfully this was released on DVD, so all of us who have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length movie. I heard the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out, but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that this was shown on television (only two years after the death of Elvis!) who did a good job with this. In fact, I haven't seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this. Highly recommended.
