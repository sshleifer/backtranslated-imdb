I came across this film from 8-10 years in a cold, dark November afternoon. I was out playing all day, freezing, and when I arrived at 4:00 pm, I took a cup of hot chocolate and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not at all happy and silly - and it was indeed obscure and moralistic. It has captured my imagination. I'm sure the text is missing, and it is abbreviated in all the wrong places for Tolkien's purist. But it still captures the spirit of history, the choice to carry a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, reckless decisions, etc. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaints. But the only place where this film clearly emerges above the new films is the characterization of the voice. John Hurt is great at this. If you don't like how the character is drawn, look away and listen. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it many, many times and it always brings me back to that time, as a child, thirsty for magical adventures. It is for this reason that I say "lucky", the film is nostalgic for me so I neglect its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, he still caught up with me, and still is.
