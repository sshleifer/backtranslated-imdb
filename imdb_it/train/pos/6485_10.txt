The world at war is one of the best documentaries on the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes cover the war and how it was in the countries involved. The first episode tells us how the Hitler came to power, and how he was able to build one of the strongest armies in the world. They are also part of the military actions undertaken during the war and of the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You all have to look at this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
