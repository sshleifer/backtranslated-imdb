Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges film that neither of them has ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and the occasional tongue panting firmly on the cheek, take a look at this. After the Second World War, life is portrayed in a simple and idyllic way. <br /> <br /> Grant is on top of his form, playing the city mouse that ventures into the life of a country squire. Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of secondary characters is comparable to You Can not Take It With You and contains a bit early from the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing is far above par. <br /> <br /> The film never bends to the rhythm of the flat grain of the low numbers of the later adaptation of The Money Pit.
