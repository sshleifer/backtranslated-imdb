Although too young to remember the first screening of the series (being only a child) later I took it on television in the late 80s, just when I was interested in war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, telling stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and then in the Pacific. Since then I have devoured many books and have seen many television series on the era of the Second World War, with conflicting opinions. British television stations are generally very good at producing them, as The World At War can easily attest, with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies. I highly recommend titles like "The Nazis - A warning From History", "Blitz" and the BBC series on Dunkirk. "Britain At War In Color", with its series of escorts "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of the highest level. The World At War is by far the best and, despite its age, it never fails to deliver. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue to appear that obviously are not included in the series and of course the Second World War took place on a canvas so large that to produce a series with EVERY detail would take more time and money then any other if such a commitment were even possible. What I feel I need to tell those who report that it doesn't include everything is that The World At War can't physically do it as a series, but surely how can it suggest you to do more research - and make it fun. This has certainly worked for me: now I have a very complete library of books, videos, DVDs, tapes and CDs. Recommend anyone with a passing interest. The series was so well made that they would have struggled to disagree with the fact that it is a quality and highly informative programming.
