"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably go down in history as the last film of the rebel party. Returning a group of high school students who use Ramones music as an inspiration to rise up against their despotic presbyter (Mary Woronov, of "Eating Raoul"), the whole film is a mile per minute. It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you will. Bullied freshmen? Check. An insensitive music teacher (Paul Bartel, also of "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. Exploding mice? Check mate. <br /> <br /> However, this is the kind of things that make life worth living. Even for someone like me who doesn't know Ramones music, it's a real pleasure. With Roger Corman executive producer and Joe Dante in co-direction, how can we expect anything less? Too bad the director Allan Arkush then degenerated into "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who appeared in all of Joe Dante's and many of Roger Corman's films), Don Steele and, of course, the Ramones. A real treat. <br /> <br /> * It seems that Bartel and Woronov have always acted together. They also starred in "Hollywood Boulevard" by Joe Dante and in the movie "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller), in which they resumed their roles as "Eating Raoul".
