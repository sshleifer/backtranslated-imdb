But it's a bit exhilarating, at least if you grew up with Weird Al, like I did. It's a mockumentary about his life and career, starting with the superstar and returning to trace the origins. It is uneven in some places, but some segments are still very funny, especially when traveling to Japan. Although he is not as emotionally structured as Lost in Translation, and finds no love for how fleeting, he captures in a bottle the utterly bizarre cultural melange that is Tokyo life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Weird Al is not recognized as the perceptive cultural observer he is; perhaps a rose with any other name would smell just as sweet. Anyway, this is a funny movie.
