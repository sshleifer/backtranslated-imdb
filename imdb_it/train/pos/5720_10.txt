I saw "The Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror movies and I really enjoyed this. There have been so many surprise scenes (what is the English word?) That made you jump. However, shouting too much from the audience made it hard not to laugh. I think the scariest scene was ... on the bus, when the face flashes on the window, or when Yoko is walking without her chin. Makeup is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see that it was there, but it still added a strange look to the scene. The boy was really very good, so cute without makeup and so terribly scary. Next time I hear a crack, I'll probably feel pretty scared ...
