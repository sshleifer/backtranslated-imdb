Mina Kumari shows more style and grace by moving from an upright position to a sitting on the floor than can be found in most other films. The director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than would seem possible. Music and dance are of the highest possible quality. You might notice in the first dance scene that the director has all kinds of things happening in the background: another girl dancing, a drunk falling down the stairs, lots of activity, but she knew we would watch Mina dance and I'll bet less that you have seen this many times, you have not noticed. All in all, perfection
