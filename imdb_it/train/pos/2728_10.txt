Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks's adaptation of Truman Capote's non-novel novel is truly an artistic achievement. Superb black and white cinematography (which was supposed to win an Oscar), a disturbing Quincy Jones soundtrack and extraordinary performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as murderers with strange correspondence. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and was not even named as best film while Dr. Doolittle was. Go figure it out! <br /> <br /> Even if you don't know Clutter's family as in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the painful process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also as impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second place. Highly recommended!
