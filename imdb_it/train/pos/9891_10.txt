I rented this film for the first time many years ago and I was completely fascinated. Just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the too-few films I have immensely enjoyed in my life, I decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I'm glad I did, because I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not minimally diminished the splendor of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl (Erendira, she played a lot of Claudia O'hana - in some ways she looks like Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns her grandmother's house, after which her grandmother, hypnoticly interpreted by Irene Papas, she forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the street to repay the damage. <br /> <br /> The vision is both fascinating and compelling, even though, in spite of the basic premises, which deals with prostitution, it is devoid of free and tasty sexual content. The story revolves around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters they come into contact with during their stay - which, by the way, is in the rough and tumultuous part of rural Mexico. > <br /> The film is very atmospheric, incredibly enigmatic with a dreamlike quality. Sometimes it borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a David Lynch film. It is also worth remembering that the film is of a very allegorical nature, read the comments of the previous spectators under ... <br /> <br /> Often in the background you hear the sounds of a solitary, silent and melancholic accordion, adding only the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are located in the desert, is truly superb. <br /> <br /> The film moves at a good pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it again, just because it makes you want to do it. For me anyway, it's really exciting. <br /> <br /> We hope you will see the film in its Spanish version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school and college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. For ejemplo: "El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba". ("The world is not as big as I thought" - that is, it's a small world.) <br /> <br /> This film reminds me somehow of tripping over an old dusty bottle of vintage wine, which, while drinking , it is immensely satisfying, however, there remains a certain sadness in realizing that there are no more bottles just like this one.
