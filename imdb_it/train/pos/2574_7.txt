Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most talented and showy comedians of the last twenty years, returns as Detective Dooley for this film. <br /> <br /> If you expect more of the same from the first film, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. Realizing that all scenarios of will battles between men and men were probably exhausted in the first film, this approach is slightly more psychological in its approach as it focuses on a criminal with a fixation with Dooley's recently deceased wife after refusing his book and blames Dooley for his death. <br /> <br /> The script may not be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good acting skills, while maintaining enough of the light humor of the first film to make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is there for everyone to see. <br /> <br /> An easy, light film, which, although not worth buying unless you are a true fan of the first film or Belushi, it is certainly worth looking at a watch when it arrives on TV. <br /> <br />
