This interesting documentary tells an extraordinary story of an expedition to bring Tibetan blind children to go trekking in the Himalayas; but also a clash of personalities between two extraordinary people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind to climb Everest, and the team of mountaineers (sighted) who lead the children. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for Tibetan blinds, who accepts the expedition but then has doubts about how it is proceeding. On one level, Sabine simply does not understand the philosophy of the mountaineer (with his emphasis on the summit); probably he is right in identifying the misalignment between the objectives of the mountaineers and the desires of the children, but his certainty in its correctness makes it a difficult person to sympathize with, especially because it has an effective veto. Against the backdrop of this (reasonably well-mannered) confrontation, we get an overview of the lives of the children themselves. I liked the film, although it provides a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even if it details the dispute, the film states in an unstoppable way how incredible are all those who are there. But it is difficult to argue with that assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer in some way irrelevant.
