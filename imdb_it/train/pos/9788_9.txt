I was at the same scriptwriters conference and saw the movie. I thought the writer, Sue Smith, summed up very clearly what the movie was about. However, the film does not really need explanation. I thought the topics were abundantly clear and stimulating. A film that addresses the ability to dare, to face fear - in particular the fear handed down by parental figures - and to overcome it and, in doing so, embrace the possibilities of life, is a film to be preserved and savored. I liked it much more than "Somersault". I also think Mandy62 was a bit rude to Hugo Weaving. As for his harvest, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been lackluster recently, but "Peaches" delivers the goods. I'm glad I saw it.
