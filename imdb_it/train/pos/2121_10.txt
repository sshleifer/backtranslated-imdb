This is a beautiful film that is wonderfully played by all players. It will make you laugh and make you cry. The end of the film makes me tarnish every time. If you want to see a great movie, this is it. Jimmy Stewert provides a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is fascinating. The diversity of character of Morgan is, to say the least, surprising. William Tracy as Pepi is a formidable comic relief and offers some of the most important lines and performances of cinema. Felix Bressart offers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, an unstoppable stumbling impresario who has the ambition of life to please those who work with him. It is a simple story of how close collaborators can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love due to unusual circumstances.
