I went to see this movie waiting for a nice relaxing moment in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I really had to control myself to convince her that I wasn't afraid. In many ways it is still a story for children, but with a script that has great potential. It could have been one of the scariest movies if programmed for another audience.
