As far as I can remember, Balanchine's changes to Ciajkovskij's soundtrack are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The final section of Grossvatertanz (a traditional melody played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give children one last dance before the scene is over. <br /> <br /> 2) A violin solo, written for but eliminated from Tchaikovsky's soundtrack for Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music for his melodic relationship with the music for the growing Christmas tree that occurs soon after. <br /> <br /> 3) The solo for the Sugar Plum Fairy rider has been eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Balanchine has somehow profaned Ciajkovskij's excellent soundtrack.
