An unexpected pleasure since I had not heard of this film. <br /> <br /> Shameful since it deserves to have a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully human story with a kindly told social message, although I must admit it predictable in its resolution. Solidly recited by the principals. Beautifully photographed with soft colors floating against the gray that captures the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent foray into the Chinese film (Shower, The Road to Home, Not One Less) was exciting and I hope to continue exploring. China and its people are an extraordinary canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in the recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
