In this small film we have some great characters, but a very superficial plot. It's really nice to look at because Singleton does a great job in presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This causes the viewer to forget the non-existent realism that this film is supposedly for. Actually what we have here is all the possible clich√©s and stereotypes put on celluloid in a higher percentage than a soap. Surely it is not a profound film (although it would like to be), but better than an average university film.
