Nice film with a fantastic soundtrack that crosses the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (birthplace of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), describes the lives of young people and their problems in the world. Remember Trainspotting, with a touch of Italian style.
