I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen several Gene Kelly movies and this is one of his best. I would put it above its most famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story was lost in the films of Gene Kelly for the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this film. Definitely worth renting.
