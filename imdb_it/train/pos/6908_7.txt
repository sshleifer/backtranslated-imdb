Richard Dreyfuss stars in "Moon Over Parador", a 1988 Paul Mazursky film with Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to shoot a movie. When the dictator dies suddenly, the secret police chief (Julia), who actually controls the dictator and the country, urges Jonathan to play the dictator, having noticed the similarity between them. Soon Jonathan is housed in the building as Alphonse Simms, and Simms' prostitute girlfriend, Madonna (Braga), who realizes that the switch promises to help him in any way possible. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears to be trailing like Simms' mother, takes a look at how the CIA operates in third world countries. The character of Winters, apparently a salesman, is actually a CIA agent. The film, however, flirts with, but does not really trample a very serious ground and is more of a feeling, and fun to this. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a fabulous job as Jonathan the actor and Alphonse the dictator, creating two separate characters and nailing both. The splendid Sonia Braga is as grandiose as Madonna, and Raul Julia participates in a mischievously entertaining performance like Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It's one of those performances where you never know what the character is thinking - it can be enjoyable or become psychopathic at any time. Charo is available as a waitress and manages to be fun and discreet at the same time. <br /> <br /> A great film, not a great success, but a lot of fun.
