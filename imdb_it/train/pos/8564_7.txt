I don't expect this film to be well understood by viewers outside Romania. This says something about the value, or perhaps the lack of universality of the film, but also says something about how the history and life of ordinary people were different in Romania than in other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during communist rule shortly after the publication of the book. It tells the story of an intellectual, a professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after being imprisoned on false charges at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to resume his life after being released. His release is actually only apparent, 60s Romania asks him for different types of compromises and crimes, but nevertheless his struggle for survival is as hard as morality. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully played by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache who has the starring role would be at another time and in another place a mega-star, we can get here a good taste of his fabulous acting art. While suffering from a hesitant story and sometimes falling into non-essential details or cartoons of characters, the film is still an important reference point for Romanian cinema, as well as for the recovery process of moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
