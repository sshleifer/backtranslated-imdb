This film captures the essence of growing up small in America for a girl alone. Realism and subtle nuances, offered to the plot by Ashley Judd, Ruby, capture what can be described as a real scenario in the Florida plot. From the slamming of a screen door, to the lack of work, the echoes of what life really is on the "neck of the red neck" offer difficult choices for the girl. Heaven was not easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit and learns to be her woman, with a force that flows from within. Ashley Judd's captivating smile and infectious gait transmit warmth and command respect and admiration. The careful rhythm of character development recalls that of "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, with Peter Fonda and directed by Victor Nunez.
