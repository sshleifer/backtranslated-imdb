I saw this movie when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it difficult to really understand Brazilian culture and society, because it has so many regional and class differences. Seeing this film in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. Show something of the daily life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it's a bit too dramatized. And this is the only negative comment I have about this film. Sometimes it's too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a movie. The director could film some things a little more subtly, making the film more effective. Despite this I liked the film and the way the story unfolds itself. The characters are complex and look a lot like people in real life. Not enough American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic, even when the plot is not so convincing.
