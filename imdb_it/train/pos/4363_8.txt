It's a little disconcerting to have a character called Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this film is the place where Gig took his name and also a good career boost after playing small parts with another name. <br /> <br /> I intend to go against most of the other comments and declare that I really enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and gritty as the oldest of the three daughters whose mother died on Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during the war of Woar I. <br /> <br /> Like "the man of the house, Fiona, remained stationary for years against the adjustment of his father's will which would then have allowed a type of Donald Trump named Charles Barclay to obtain the family home. But Fiona is hiding the reason for her way of hating Barclay. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the average and enamored sister, who is married to an Englishman but longs for the boyfriend of her younger sister (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you are a Stanwyck fan, don't miss it.
