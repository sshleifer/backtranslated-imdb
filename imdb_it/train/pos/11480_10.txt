Hunting cut: this is one of the most incredible and intense films I've seen in a long time. The first film in years that left me absolutely baffled. I could barely hear myself leave the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I've been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie, and simply failing. Emphasizing any aspect of it - the video diary format in documentary style, the unrepeatable representation of events, the strength of the characters - seems to trivialize everything. Some may find it ridiculous that any killer can be characterized as normal. But then not all murderers are crazy delirious froths. Many are fairly regular, unpretentious people. They are simply wired differently. <br /> <br /> And this is perhaps the most chilling thought of all.
