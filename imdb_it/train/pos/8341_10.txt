Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. This film accomplishes what all great films aspire to: the creation of a world and a time that we want to see again and make us happy to be part of the human race. When they are blue, this film lifts my spirit and makes me laugh (and this is still true after many visions - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All the actors are in good shape. The characterizations are so lifeless and the characters mix so well together that the actor is forgotten (usually difficult to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The supporting cast is constantly brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a total pygmy pack!"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists like "Greek chorus" - "but time does not exist"), Durning ( "something we can launch from NJ"), Shalhoub & Whaley (chief and collaborator of Robbins at the gas station), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies Eisenhower have?). <br /> <br /> Don I miss this underrated treasure.
