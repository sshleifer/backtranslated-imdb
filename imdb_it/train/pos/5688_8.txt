Opening: large. Music: right for this movie. Cinematography: squalid with great effect. <br /> <br /> excruciating emotion in a certain sense of nausea. This is how some lives can become out of control. "Wonderland" describes the wild nature induced by drugs (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but shows how this really happens in our society. It is better than the representations of another wild group - Manson - because all the films, books, etc. Manson's focus is so much on Manson's insane mind rather than the general picture of cheap fame and randomness that is so pervasive nowadays. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "Method-acting" on the film, look at Kilmer in this movie. Show as "The Method" can be compelling in the right role. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers here manage to get "out of control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of giving us chills at low cost.
