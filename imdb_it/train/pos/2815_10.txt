I can't believe my eyes when I read a lot of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic, funny, crazy, violent but with the minimum gore, and in the end energetic in the center. I loved every single bit of it. I can't remember anything crazy like this made for laughter and martial art on display. And now the most important thing (at least for me): it's free from the effects of the computer. When I look at some Hollywood actors to dub it on the screen with the modern high definition action and damn high budget "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I understand that any child * beep * can do it - you can adjust the threads on the body, add some nice PC effects and insert them into the action movie. Here it is different. I don't think there will also be a dozen physically advanced action stars around the world, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the "Chinese football" comedy. And it's just a small Hong Kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It doesn't spoil the atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> I can't help but mention a very neat theater play. I suppose some of you won't appreciate it. As for me - it's incredible. Take a look at the Dragon's friend who is speaking bravely with the criminals and suddenly punches a fist in the left side of his head. His facial expression turns into something whimsical and approaches Dragon with a childlike expression. And take a look at the threatening dimension of his mouth - it's almost from ear to ear when he makes faces. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people around the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for the release of classic Jackie Chan films. His moderns are much weaker in my humble opinion and don't deserve much fanfare. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary film of its kind. Thanks for the attention.
