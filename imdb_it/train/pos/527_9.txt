It is no surprise that writer / director Michael Powell considered "A Matter of Life and Death", his charming 1946 Emeric Pressburger fantasy as his favorite movie among their films. Released during the Second World War, this colorful romantic adventure would have provided only the tonic for a traumatized and recovering nation that needed a good lift. <br /> <br /> After a series of other patriotic war films, "Archers made this one the strangest, the most abrupt and the most patriotic of the lot. Quintessentially British to support the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), he is also visibly Americanized in his Baroque compositions, technical inventiveness and a refined multi-ethnic cast. <br /> <br /> Strangely, it echoes another classic 1946, "It's a wonderful life", AMOLAD opens on a large firmament, with one of those cheerful voices that preach the earth and the sky, and in what great world and wonderful we live. <br /> <br /> Then he cuts into a British cockpit, badly hit, on fire and with the copilot already dead. It seems wrong, but the connection is soon made clear with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> With a nearly 5-minute clock, the rapid exchange between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American radio June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its intimacy. Resigned to dying, Peter nevertheless exudes a lot of vigor, charm and outpouring of confessions, and his warm friendship with June ends with a mutual exchange of "I love you". <br /> <br /> Keeping the magic of the moment, Peter, with the supervision of his conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the "Other world", escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach. He then meets June riding a bicycle and immediately matches the body with his voice. <br /> <br /> But realizing their mistake, the High Court wants Peter to be sent back, and orders the French handler (Maurice Goring) to go ashore to retrieve it. But Peter is adamant about living because of June and the director's mistake, and intentionally guards his corner. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate ultimately resides with the heavenly court and the American attorney (Raymond Massey), whose jury is composed of several late war heroes and refined British delegates. The surreal process, which dissolves from b / w to rich Technicolor, once the verdict has been announced, could be a dream, but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable result. <br /> <br /> The abstract, frame filling "stairway to heaven" (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in b / w, when it elevates Peter and his enigmatic French guardian towards tall, crossing giant statues of Peter's potential lawyers for the trial, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the delicately lit colorful staircase provides the setting for what is an iconic image in the cinema: Peter and June are frozen side by side, their eyes staring forward into the frame, their destiny sealed. <br /> <br /> The improbable affection shared between Peter and June never becomes sloppy or verbose; is treated with nobility and the perception that the couple is already fit enough to be married and that they simply need to convince people of their love, so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can freeze the time and the body of the people, gets in the way of many of their key moments together, giving lessons to Peter about history and his mischievous tricks, plucking the book "Top 100 Game Tricks "by Peter and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> As visually inspired as other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, this was the first time they combined color with b / w ?? the latter has a cheerful quality when used for heavenly scenes, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The exceptional script is more than suitable for imaginative scenography, with dialogues so immediate that they do not seem to be written or performed for the screen. Funny and witty, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves the same acclaim with their strong color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, "A question of life and death" is one of those films that challenges age, looking fresh and inventive, even in this era in which CGI would shorten its effects artificial, probably stripping them of their emotional wonder. <br /> <br /> Other shocking changes will include the need to reduce the average cut seconds and the inevitable reason to shorten the dialogue in order to preserve the scarce attention of most of the public. Powell weaves a spell that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter's situation.
