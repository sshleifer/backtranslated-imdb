Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels that God is ruining his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone the powers of God could take a bad turn. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is top notch and seems as comfortable as God and the cast puts together the plot well. The jokes are almost always on the target, even if they sometimes recur a little too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film actually depicted God, not only that, but also as a black man. I thought it pretty well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, such as the opening cookie scene, others miss the lens slightly but are still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
