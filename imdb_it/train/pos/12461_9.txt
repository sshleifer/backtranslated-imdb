An intelligent screenplay by SEBASTIAN's late JAPRISOT and the intelligent performances of the two male protagonists - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should be the other way round) translate into an engaging and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to the above the competent direction of the veteran JEAN HERMAN and a spartan but effective soundtrack by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy because this film has a strange timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friend or a story of bonding with two loners, disillusioned and tired of the world, who return, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of this period (after the Second World War that led to the 1960s), France had struggled to keep up appearances abroad. Losing Algiers was a blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU The AMI (the original title) tells the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to solve it, after their dismissal. /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the viewer must really pay attention, because JAPRISOT is lean and cheap with his script: if it's there, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that these two men face each other physically and psychologically for a long weekend. Their motivation is very different, their goals are different: their survival depends entirely on each other. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are outwardly so different - the first, probably a handsome boy, and the latter a bad thug, he adds to chemistry. <br /> <br /> That research makes a great story, which in turn, is a great movie. <br /> <br /> To not forget that there are women in this film, and true to the Japrisot method, they too are memorable, although they are not as detailed; to say much more would ruin the joy of discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM; AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; ONLY IN ENGLISH (not even the subtitles for the deaf); A WORKING TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK but the music of DE ROUBAIX has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
