A very funny film, provided you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not approach the mysteries of Agatha Christie or Thin Man as a film noir, but it is much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" or "let's put on a show" behind the scenes of the musical. As a musical, it's not Busby Berkley or Freed, but it can enhance the classic "Coctails for two" and the strange "Sweet Marijuana". The film runs in real time during a theatrical show, the opening night of "Vanity", where a murder - and soon another - is discovered in the backstage. Has the killer been discovered before the curtain falls? Sure, but the search is fun, even if somewhat predictable and marked by explosions of comic relief (fortunately in the form of the shapely goddess of choral girls, Toby Wing). The bewildered policeman is just a little too stupid, the hero is a bit too cute, the protagonist a little too kind, the bitch primadonna a little too shrewd, and the fanatic in love a little too selfless, but as stereotypes go, they are quite fashionable. There is a multitude of really gorgeous choir girls, who are even better choices than girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same period, which sometimes tend to be a little on the plump side. Yes, this film could have been much better than it is, and the Duke Ellington issue is an embarrassment, but if you like to immerse yourself in old movies, this will be a tremendously tempting journey.
