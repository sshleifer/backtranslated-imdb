I don't see how anyone can say that Freddy's Nightmares is a cheese and a rip-off. Obviously you don't know good TV when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's Nightmares and hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series has been sucked, you have the right to your opinion, but remember it's just your opinion and it means nothing. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and will come to accept it soon enough. If you don't like it, don't look at it but don't deny its brilliance.
