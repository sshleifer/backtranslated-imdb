I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had the impulse to rent something we had never seen before and we came across this beautiful movie. We had no idea what it was going to be, but it turned out to be spectacular. 2 inches up. I liked how the movie was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that makes you think that I strongly recommend you to quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but this could ruin the movie for you, so I won't. This film is definitely in my top 10 of the best movies. Do you really think that Nothing is inflatable?
