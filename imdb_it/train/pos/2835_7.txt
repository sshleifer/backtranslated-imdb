I should like to thank the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors that I only paid 1.4 USD and that I could have such surprisingly fun. <br /> <br /> Adultery? As is common in our modern days. Eva kidnapped her two children and kidnapped Nick to hunt down Luis and Charlotte in Italy. He wants his revenge done but in the end he also commits the same crime as Luis: he had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small independent production, Vivian Naefe has tackled the initial problems of modern marriage with a light heart. greater mobility in the physical, mental and technological areas? Marital engagement requires too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to the circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte but fell in love with Eva after that abduction trip that forced him to live a lot of growth. <br /> <br /> Many spectators may feel happy for the finale because Eva and Nick come together, well, this should be the biggest punishment for the unfaithful deed of their spouses. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four would develop after this exchange. Perhaps they can exchange again, as one can be so sure of the shaky loving relationship. <br /> <br /> Good acting and good scenery. The two small child actors should not be overlooked, especially the boy when he cries at the hotel reception in Venice. And of course, how to forget the "beautiful, beautiful" scenario of the city.
