This film scared the hell out of me! I have to admit that I spent most of the film looking at my fingers but what I saw was really scary. I screamed loudly two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> As for the cinema, my favorite aspects were sound and photography. The sound was particularly beautiful and the setting was truly terrifying. I read somewhere that it is a strange husband and wife team that made it. For some reason this makes it even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you like the jumps and jitters of scary movies, this is the one for you! A lot of suspense and a great movie to rent with a group of friends who love watching movies curled up on a couch screaming like little girls!
