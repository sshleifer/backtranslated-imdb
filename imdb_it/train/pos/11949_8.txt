The second Woody Allen film set in London. The Tarot Card killer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) has a suggestion that it could be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to thrill him but falls in love quickly. She is helped by theatrical wizard Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like it better than the overrated "Match Point" last year. It was shorter and moved much faster. The plot is old but I was entertained and kept me to the last. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comic lines (all of them of Allen, of course). He is not one of Allen's best but he is much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> Acting is, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times and got tired. But Johansson and Jackman are simply fantastic: they are fantastic and offer two very eye-catching credible performances. Even Allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal - there's a sequence in which they are both in their swimsuits to show their beautiful bodies. The only real objection is that Allen still seems uncertain about how to shoot in London. It's not as far away as in "Match Point" - maybe it will get better going forward. <br /> <br /> To see. I give him an 8.
