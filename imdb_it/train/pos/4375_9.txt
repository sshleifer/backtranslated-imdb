Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacular film, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the other hand, is slightly less polished, but far better. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historical values, while Braveheart has put a coarse and unpleasant contemporary luster on an ancient story. What makes this film is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role that he basically rejected (in a refined way) in Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but he is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. Admirable but human, it commands the screen. Against him are a series of equally human adversaries, including Tim Roth's hateful but brilliant Cunningham and the morally bankrupt petty thief of John Hurt. Also to praise Jessica Lange as Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is just how it should be. This is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of its own convictions and the strong performances make you worry.
