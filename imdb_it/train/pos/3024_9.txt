A film that has dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable advent of World War II, when a Spanish Republican, sent by his soon to overthrow the government, (Charles Boyer) infiltrates England in search of support for his cause by seeking of influence the rich owners of mines for not selling coal to the fascists in Spain. He disturbs the locals, is convincingly beaten in a scene, and later in the film in front of an angry mob of miners who see it as another threat to their rickety livelihoods. Despite the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film cleverly explores a dark and suspenseful intrigue that involves unfaithful compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and is carefully filmed in numerous illuminated scenes in a sad hotel by James Wong Howe, and runs more than once to get under his skin.
