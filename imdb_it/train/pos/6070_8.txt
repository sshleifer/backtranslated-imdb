Yes, Shakespeare would have been really proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad. On the other hand, Kenneth Brannagh was brilliant. His script was wonderful, as was his game with the audience. Very nice work. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there have been too little dramas in which more would have been expected. For example, the killing of Cassius was somewhat blurred by the fact that too often it happened in a detached way, causing the viewer to turn his head to grab everything. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness struck Roderigo was unusual; annoying too. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Otello before, look at this. If you haven't read Otello, look at this. If you haven't heard Othello, look at this. Instead, do yourself a favor by reading it, seeing him act on stage and hear him sing too.
