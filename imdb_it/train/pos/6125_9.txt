Okay, here's what I think of Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and thought to myself, this sounds interesting. I rent it and take it home. The boy was right, it's interesting. They put the spirits of serial killers in dreams, in walking corpses and in everyday cars. But this must be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the funny images of snowmen that spread the landscape, the lunch box, the snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he put a bit of fun into a murderer you can't see at FREDDY KRUGGER. Exactly, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's that "cool" level. I wish some of the puppet effects were better, the mouth movements could have matched better. But I carry it up to a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some great liners and scares to blow up any hardcore horror fan. All in all, a good story, good effects, excellent dialogue and an exceptional cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
