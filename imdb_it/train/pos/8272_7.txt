A family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes out for a family that meets in a remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This angers some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong. <br /> <br /> I expected the worst when I started watching it. Most of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. Well ... I don't agree. First of all it is NOT a horror movie. The horror doesn't even start until the last 30 minutes. Sounds more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in. At that level, it's pretty damn nice. <br /> <br /> First: the bad things: the rhythm is WAY too slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor; VIE too many sequences of false dreams frighten; the wendigo can barely get into the film and the clear vision we get of wendigo in the end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good things: pretty good drama; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; a good direction with disturbing sound effects that are a bit scary; a rather explicit hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); beautiful acting by Sullivan (only 10 at the moment!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are bothered by this movie because it's being passed off as a horror movie - which it isn't. So if you can ignore it, I think you might like it. I am giving a 7.
