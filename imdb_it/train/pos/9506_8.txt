A sober and reflective piece, a small miniature that blossoms in a magnificent human pictorial sequence that goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen. This small and quiet story will keep you fascinated - if you don't have too many problems with the various Spanish accents ranging from the Mexican to the Peruvian, and the more authentic Iberian peninsular use of Marisa Paredes! Garcíadiego has made a perfect adaptation from the novel: even the great master García Márquez should be proud of his superb work. And hat to Arturo Ripstein who has so cleverly concerted the whole effort into a jewel, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ..... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - is waiting to get his pension, while he continues to live in his ramshackle wooden house in the Colombian jungle (however, shot elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his fighting cock and his wife (in that order?) And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, so much more .... This film is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this little poetic piece again as soon as possible. It deserves the highest side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not light commercial Hollywood stuff.
