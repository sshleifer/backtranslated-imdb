I don't care how many bad reviews rain purple rain, this movie sounds! Excellent film, it has everything, great music (Prince of grearse!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad, very moving film. I don't want to say much more, I don't want to give the plot, but I'll say this: the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships going through these problems, so many families similar to the one depicted in the film. I see that this is very realistic and is so real that it makes the film much more moving. My generation loved this growing movie, so many of us loved Prince and there is a lot to report for every teenager who has had similar problems. <br /> <br /> That being said, it's not just a movie for teenagers, Id recommend it to all ages. And it's not all so dark, the film has good music, group performance scenes and fun and sexy scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
