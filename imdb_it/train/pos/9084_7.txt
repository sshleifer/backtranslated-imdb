Yes, some people have said that this film was a waste of money, but I'm the kind of fan of the action movie die dragon / world-ending / holy crap. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from my point of view this movie has had some of the best action actions were quite well dang. But it's that kind of movie that everything got tougher at the right time, or just when the evil was triumphant, something fell to save them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and bands in the film that surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics were damn beautiful. I mean for this type of film the 3D effects were FANTASTIC !!!! The big battle that was shown in the trailers is up to any kind of hype in the movie. The struggle between good and evil in the end was, I must say, it could have been longer and slightly better, it was still quite good. <br /> <br /> Now to the parties that I think could have been better. The beginning was quite good showing the parts that lead to great battles. I mean, if you don't really want to go and watch this movie in theaters, at least this is a DVDer ... <br /> <br /> overall I really liked the movie, but the plot has gone to shape lasts only for good.
