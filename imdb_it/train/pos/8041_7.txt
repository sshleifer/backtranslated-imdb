Despite some negative comments that this film has collected in the pages of IMDb, it is still worth taking a look because this is a story of survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities during a difficult mission in the Panamanian jungle. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa accompanies us to see this thriller set in Panama. The film has some good moments while Beckett, the veteran sailor, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious head of the drug cartel and the corrupt army general who could be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what has been entrusted to him. <br /> <br /> Miller, the arrogant newly arrived man in the jungle and guerrilla warfare between military and drug lords against infiltrators American intelligence men learn a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger, is an actor who doesn't record much, as shown in this film, but in the context of the film, he is just like a man of few words. Billy Zane who plays Miller does what he can with a role that doesn't give him glory until the crucial end. <br /> <br /> For action movie lovers, "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action that would have made a movie more satisfying with a little refinement.
