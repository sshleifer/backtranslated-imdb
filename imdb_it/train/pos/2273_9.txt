I have yet to see a movie with Nolte that I didn't like. However, having said that, he made many films and I only saw a few. In my mind, I'm keeping the images of his performance here and the one in "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of acting talents. When it is necessary to shout, it roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those that I treasure in the actors: when he emulates only through the gestures of the face, hands and body, without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors, in general, has no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking, having no conscious appreciation of Keaton and Chaplin's mastery, this generation of actors relies too much on magic computer mechanics. Of course, it is also just a sign of the times in which we live. Chaplin lived in our times ... who knows, it might even have become an aficionado of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I have not read Vonnegut's novel from which this film arrives on screen. However, the plot is not so far-fetched or complicated that we cannot follow the path traced, even with all its surprises. Of course it seems absurd at first. However, it is not even impossible. <br /> <br /> Consider these for beginners: A spy in the heart of the Third Reich: The extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, America's most important spy in the Second World War of Delattre and Prichard (see Amazon for more details ). Consider: History Undercover: Piercing the Reich: American Spies on the DVD of Nazi Germany (I saw this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a production of channels historical. <br /> <br /> So, is the plot ridiculous? Far, yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. The character of Nolte is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not provide us with an adequate reason why he accepts. It was a kind of passivity, which was sucked into this role as it says, why was it the best story I've ever written and played the role? It is a difficult thing to imagine that any of us could grasp. But it was an unusual moment and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The acting of the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out, Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked by the end of the film (no - I won't ruin it) and it made me feel bad for the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had said all that was necessary and that others would be added to a life already full of many burned pages? Hard to say, but it really jolts. <br /> <br /> Nolte offers one of the best performances we can expect ... the premise of the film makes you think of many things. It's very fun and provocative. What great films should be. A little long but worth it. By the way, the film's music has selections from one of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
