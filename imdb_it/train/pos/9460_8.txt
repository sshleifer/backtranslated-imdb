I loved the story. Somewhere, a poster says that there are no families like the one depicted in this film. Well, maybe there should be. I thought everyone looked really human and credible. What a first-rate cast. What excellent music for the soundtrack. How nice this, and how nice, but most of all, I'll say two words to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> It really showed a nice, subtle depth that touched me. He was really authoritative as a widower who had spent too much time being a good dad before, at the cost of denying his needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like a petulant donkey? Because, yes, he did. <br /> <br /> And see, this is what was perfect in this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that he was FEELING something, and not simply acting as if he felt something, and he perfectly transmitted to me what he felt, and what he felt was denied. <br /> <br /> Happiness denied. <br /> <br /> Fulfillment denied. <br /> <br /> Love denied. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is painful beyond imagination and many who do it will never feel anything like this again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him an eight out of ten.
