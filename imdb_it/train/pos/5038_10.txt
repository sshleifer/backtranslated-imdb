What a real surprise and rather unexpected. This is the real thriller movie. I rushed to the video store, took a movie without reading the whole blurb on the back and hoped for the best. I was totally surprised and delighted. I really liked the actors and their characters. I thought everyone gave a great performance and made their character realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and direct. It kept you interested from start to finish and it never got boring for just one minute. I highly recommend this movie for those who love thrillers, especially thrillers that are well-stimulated and those that catch your attention. Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.
