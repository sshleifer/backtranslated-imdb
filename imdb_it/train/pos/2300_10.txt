This film has so many wonderful elements! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is, of course, wonderful, but so is his chemistry with Jason London. The score is remarkable, airy and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of every film he composes ten times. He also seems to have a talent for the films of the lost days of youth, be sure to take his score for the recent "Peter Pan" and the obsessive Gothic music of "The Village". I saw this movie for the first time around the 13th or 14th and now I don't cry at the end, I shed a tear or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will end up becoming a comforting film for life.
