This film does not fail to engage and move, even in 2008 for an audience that is familiar with modern sound and improved computer techniques. <br /> <br /> The experience of the cinema goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been a truly profound and satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> You can ask a director of today to make a two-hour silent film and make it interesting and get the same result as time and balance structure of this film. Silent film production was pure art, it had to draw attention through its structure, its direction and its acting - there were no exits with more words or computer-generated distractions. A badly made or uninteresting silent film is unwatchable. <br /> <br /> This film must be placed in the context of those who might be baffled with the mention of Christian themes. This is not a "Christian" film, it does not sell anything. These themes together with the reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - even the church that went on Sunday was a national past time, Christianity was a given in many families, so the film only shows normal life as it was then . The themes would have sounded real and deep at the time. <br /> <br /> It is very strange given the strong support for the good Christian thought of this particular film (and it is not preaching religion to anyone, only highlighting the difference between the hypocrites and the honest ones) that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a film industry representative with a large crowd he denounced Pickford as an example of immorality, along with other individuals appointed by him. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should have seen this movie released in 1922, and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> The Pastor complained that since the film industry started the church the participation had fallen by 500,000. However, the film's representative in the debate made the following observations; even that presence in the saloon had diminished, there were many more pastors in prison than actors (fact) and that selecting some examples among the many was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> So there was a constant battle between church and film industry during the early days of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film about being honest and faithful to family friends and being willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, exuberant, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and silently sacrificing - even if poor and ignorant she represented the perfect character. But this is not thrown down the throat, but it is revealed a little at a time in the film. <br /> <br /> Remember some modern Chinese films in which the characters are slowly, languidly revealed in the course of a film and it is this time that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It has a uniform and regular time for the first half which creates all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes are a great cinematographic production and it is necessary to appreciate that the dialogue in progress was achieved without the benefit of sound - it was achieved thanks to a good action and a great direction. Sometimes it's surprising to realize that at the end of the film you didn't hear a spoken word, but it seems like you've heard it all. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast has done great shows especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are the typical Pickford humor, when he comes out with the excuse of sweeping the snow, an almost perfect balance and the end. This is a special kind of moving humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied some from Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation to make of the Silent films and in particular of the Pickford films is that the star often has to keep the camera for most of the film without the audience becoming tired or bored with the overexposure of the actors. That Pickford is usually the center of attention through most of his films, but people can't get enough of her is a testament to his acting ability.
