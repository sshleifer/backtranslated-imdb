Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the true story of Grace Elliot, an English woman who remained in France during the height of the French revolution. It was always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but he knew he was such a bloody reactionary. If Rohmer's imperturbable defense of the monarchy can be put aside (and this is not an easy thing to do, given that, for example, the lower French classes are portrayed here as horrible slobs), this is actually an elegant film, intelligent and refined. Lacking the money for a major film reconstruction of 18th century France, Rohmer instead played against obvious painted cartoons. It's a manifestly artificial presumption, but it works somehow. And the newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make a character who shouldn't be nice.
