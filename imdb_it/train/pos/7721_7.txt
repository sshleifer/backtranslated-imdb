A flying saucer equipped (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to control a colony founded about 25 years ago on a "forbidden planet". What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist persecuted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization into which she has plunged. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a mystery of pulp scifi murder. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is a trait and, somehow, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi movie, of course, it's The Tempest, but how many hundreds of movies can you say something like this? <br /> <br /> Below, this is a warning about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its proper and safe use. Yet the film still proceeds with all hope for our future that we expected from shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired direction and the irregular action almost invisible. If it wasn't for the silly back-art-deco of the science fiction objects of the fifties, you might think you were looking at a piece from the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of that very special sci fi subgenre I like to define the science fiction of the 50s and, even if, in my opinion, the best thing is surely to see for anyone interested in the science fiction and special effects movies. The clever plot, now made trivial by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even in Farscape, deserves attention and will arouse the interest of many scifi fans. The trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film that seem to have inspired the themes of the original Star Trek series aired about 12 years later, although they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) sexism of the 1950s and the lack of any kind of racial integration. While I do not intend to fur the egg, the lack of social progress shown in this film was the only big problem I had with this film. <br /> <br /> Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of the beautiful young Leslie Nielsen in one of her first leading roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only mediocre and sometimes poor (especially at the height of the film). Walter Pigeon, although quite excellent in other films, also plays his role. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman and the extraordinary Robby the Robot are the leading actors in this crowd, even if overall the leading actors in the ensemble do a good job. The problems with the performances in the foreground, I think, are as much the director's and the editor's fault, as anything else. Although they have certainly had most of the film quite well.
