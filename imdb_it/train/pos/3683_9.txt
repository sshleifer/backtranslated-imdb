18 directors had the same task: to tell love stories set in Paris. Of course, some of them turned out better than others, but the whole mosaic is quite fascinating - besides, wouldn't it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? Here's how I classify the segments (which could change to a second view): <br /> <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin", by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors ever directed my favorite column, with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara always wonderful. Witty and delicious. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville"), the story of a child whose parents are mimes; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries" by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Funny <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Children of Men"), company. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", by Oliver Schmitz, company. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "Fourteenth arrondissement", Alexander Payne ("Election", "About Schmidt"), the wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here, firm. the underrated character actress Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby") as a lone, middle-aged American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", the frenetic style of Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run") works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind (Melchior Beslon) who they fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", by Wes Craven, company. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but moving story of talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno feat); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad plot. the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple, but fun); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", by Vincenzo Natali, company. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires", by Nobuhiro Suwa, company. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille", by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underrated "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle", by Richard LaGravenese, company. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments as genius and others as media (or even a bit boring), but none of them is simply bad. Overall, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" at 8.5 / 10 and recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic about love and other things in between.
