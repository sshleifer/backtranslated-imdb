There is no denying that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market merchants who soon realize that, being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fighting against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact they are getting worse than they were before everything started, this is where morality comes into play. It's when they lose all their food that they think they're being beaten and demand a surrender, just to have the whole of London responding to their situation by sending food, a lot of it. Thus allowing them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This film is the right note, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It has a right tone, not too sentimental and the moral of the story does not force you down your throat. Worth seeing
