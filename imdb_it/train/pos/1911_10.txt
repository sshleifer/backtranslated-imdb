I love the most recent episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the plot with Kate falling in love with the principal. I want to find out what happens to Rory, Kerry, Bridget and the family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I've always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's an honor to his acting that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and I totally believe in him as Kate's Dad. This family is so real and fun. He was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but like in real life these things happen and the way it was written in the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitive and lovingly addressed. But generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun.
