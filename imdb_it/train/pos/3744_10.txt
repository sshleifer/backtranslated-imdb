This is probably the best short crime film I've ever seen. The acting is superb, especially Amanda Burton, whose character goes from fearful to sweet to disturbing to sad and then to some ... She does an extraordinary job balancing the feelings of Rachel / Carlas and reciting the pain of someone who has lost a child , it is so believable that it seems more like a real life story than a drama. The other actors are obviously fantastic too, usually they are on British TV / Movies. The ending, which I'm not going to give away, is fantastic especially because you don't really get one ... (you'll get what I mean after seeing it) It's worth buying and seeing it and once again and if you're not touched by this you're a person with a cold heart.
