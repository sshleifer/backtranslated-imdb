What can I say about a story like this? This magical tale has followed me since my early childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to so many extravagant places that make you want more in every scene. For example, in the market there were so many different tastes of tradition. I loved the exotic dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The plot was wonderful. I wanted so much that Landsbury decided to keep the babies early and also to be with Mr. Brown, and find the other half of the spell so that men less armor could win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a child inside, and this movie attracts my inner child like no other. This film is my absolute favorite of all time. I hope all the children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away and transported to another time.
