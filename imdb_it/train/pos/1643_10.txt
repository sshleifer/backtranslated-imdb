This is a film that should be seen by everyone if you want to see fantastic acting. Mr Torn and Mrs Farrel do exceptional work. I think they should have it on TV again so that a new audience can appreciate it. Wonderful shows. <br /> <br /> It gives you a real feeling of what the pioneers have had to go through both physically and emotionally. An unheard of film. <br /> <br /> It was done when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I have always thought of her as a comedian, but this is certainly not a comedy and is simply wonderful. There are very few dialog boxes, but this makes it seem more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence and only his breath has a great feeling. I have to see the movie.
