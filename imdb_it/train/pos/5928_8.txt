This is not a good movie, but I still like it. The Clovis cat is golden in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the bad sleepwalkers. I think there's a lot more to this film than people realize, it's basically very hard, but this brusque can sometimes be good. It has the banal lines, the abrupt ending and a comic element transmitted by clumsy policemen. Has anyone found the incestuous element a little disturbing? Ultimately this film is accidentally and casually acrimonious, which is quite effective, I compare it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and child, the change of the protagonists. I think it also works abruptly, this is not a movie you want to stretch, it only works if it's short. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure if the director was lacking in depth or if he did this with the purpose, we know that Stephen King has abilities, yet I haven't even read his books, I've only seen some of the his films. <br /> <br /> However, I liked it. If you like hard and dry films with 80s tones just look at them. but don't expect too much. It's really so ugly it's beautiful.
