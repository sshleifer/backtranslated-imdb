This will probably not be the best comedy of the year, some too many coincidences and holes in the plot. However we are talking about a film in which a leading man and a white bread seller become friends, so some whims should not be a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, the James Bond wood went off (a role in which it was wasted). If you can keep this kind of quality, I hope you continue to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as a straight man of Brosnan. I read some negative comments here about Hope Davis, but I thought she was pretty good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep inside. There are many good laughs while Brosnan makes his way and some scenes in which I almost died laughing. My father (a consultant) almost lost it when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator". Very similar to "Grosse Pointe Blank", another hit-man comedy, humor can be very dark. If you are there, get ready to have fun.
