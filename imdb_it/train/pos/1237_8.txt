This was a decidedly original film and a brave move for all those involved. I don't care if it's not the most well-made film of all time, the fact that I have Eddie Murphy doing something non-formulaic, and that I don't know what will happen next, makes it my favorite. I wish more films were imaginative like this, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.
