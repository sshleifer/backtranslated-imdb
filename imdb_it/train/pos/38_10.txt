One of the best Three Stooges shorts ever. A spooky house full of evil men and "The Goon" challenge the best men of the Alert Detective Agency. Hemp is in excellent shape in the famous dark scene. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich, as the target of a murder plot. Before it is over, Shemp's "trusty little shovel" is used to great effect. This 16-minute gem moves at the same speed as any Stooge short and contains double the wallop. Highly recommended.
