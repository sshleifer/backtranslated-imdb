I found this film that stimulates reflection, and its ambiguity is renewed in a world of fast-resolution films in which we are manipulated to love the "good boy" and hate the "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of portraying the family of black sheep / lost child who aspires to obtain the love and respect of his father, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual image as a good boy as a father who has triangulated his children and now remains with what he has always refused. <br /> <br /> When I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was enchanted by the way sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as the director explains. <br /> <br /> This is a good successor of the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized, even Judd Hirsch was in that!
