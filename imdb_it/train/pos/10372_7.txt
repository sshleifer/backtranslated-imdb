ROLL is a wonderful little film. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old boy (very well acted, by the way) who plays soccer. Malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many curves involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough cyclists, some cops and some prostitutes ... and the movie makes us understand how the characters are from which part of the law, what is the content of each gym bag and also which genre is a key motorcyclist. Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARBABI. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL has reinforced three opinions that I had already held before seeing ROLL. Those opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it seems such a beautiful place for a vacation. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best directors are Australian. ROLL's cinematography was particularly impressive. I loved the colors and the stylized lights in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are HOT!
