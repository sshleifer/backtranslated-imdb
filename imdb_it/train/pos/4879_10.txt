A Chinese scholar who harshly criticizes the arrogant nationalist war policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a "communist" and imprisoned for life. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and her ideas, was left alone to save her family from hunger. This film is a huge statue erected in praise of the mother's role in human history. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less sublime in the title role and was a monumental scandal that did not get an Asian Oscar for best female role in 2009. It went to a girl with very limited acting potential. <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and "human" characteristic is a must see for all "true children" on earth.
