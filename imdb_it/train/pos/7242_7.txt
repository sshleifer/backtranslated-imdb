1933 seemed to be a great year for satires ("Duck Soup" for example) and this fits well even if it is an obsession with contract bridge. The tone is like a humorous piece of the New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the "Goings On About Town" page of that magazine. The only strange thing is the casting. Done a few years later William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you would not have had such sophisticated adultery, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some sharp and worn-out clothes, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge race on the radio. Even if you don't know anything about bridge, you may still want to take a look at a rare example of Hollywood satire.
