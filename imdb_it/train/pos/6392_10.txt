This independent function, in black and white, DV is constantly shaken, amazes and amuses with its ability to create the craziest situations and then find humor and interest in them. It's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, but as absurd as the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film on the ground, keeping the whole song from drifting to complete madness and here is the real message here. This film is about how we all survive in a crazy world. This seems to be the heart of the film. As crazy and off the wall as things are, Leon, 30 years old. old protagonist of paperboy, he always tries to keep it together. It is like a child who always tries to grab the balloon that is floating so that everything is resolved for the best, so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film could have gone far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece together. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the group here with a performance that shines through his absurd sick tics. Just like the characters in the movie, we neglect his sudden explosions to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. It takes the most ridiculous twists and keeps them real. It's his script and his cast that help keep everything afloat. It is a true testimony of Majkowski's ability and of all those involved in the fact that this film, with its plot and characters, never worked. Majkowski took a film that could have been abrasive and repulsive, and somehow gave him heart and humor. This is a unique film. Not to be missed. <br /> <br />
