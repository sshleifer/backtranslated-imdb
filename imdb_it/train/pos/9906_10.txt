YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, acting varies from medium to ridiculous. Yes, it has already been done so many times. However, what we are dealing with is a film that does not stray from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than what it is. There are indeed some original death scenes and the tension increases during the film. Moreover, you will never be more than a few minutes from a bloody murder. I invite everyone to watch this film with an unscrupulous eye and see it for what it aims to be; a scary and fun slasher moves with a melody of the theme second to none.
