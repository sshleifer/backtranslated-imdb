Tressa's vocal performance was exceptional !! Tressa played the role of female singer, while Richard was in the club. When he made his debut on stage for the first time, and started riffing and straining his stuff, he shook my soul. His voice is platinum. He needs to make a CD. He has more fans than she does. I loved his show stopping the performance in the five heartbeats, which he also starred with Leon when he was younger. How can a child have such a big voice. It's really surprising. Good voice Good Good Good Good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic, shaking the back, crying tearful, uplifting, takes you back in the voice of the days. If you read this commit, please follow my advice and start recording a CD. If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. I think you can really do it. Look at these other successful single hit singers, lol.
