This film is hard to look at in our hectic 21st century culture, but it's worth it for the messages it conveys, especially the consequences and ramifications of technology on society, particularly when that technology is used for war. /> <br /> This film presents a complete cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a warning against the improper use of technology, but while the circle is completed, familiar themes and feelings manifest themselves again to present selfish rather than self-destructive ways in which humanity can use technology. <br /> <br /> Brilliant for its time, the quality of the image and sound can be a challenge for some, but as a reference point in the history, development and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. In the end, free will and free choice are once again placed on humanity as a means of controlling our destiny rather than having served it by someone else or, indeed, by the state of society itself, as shaped by world events. <br /> <br /> Whoever is oppressed by what life throws at times tends to remain so, but nevertheless there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this film claims. <br /> <br /> Regarding the qualification of science fiction, one of the greatest common demoninatori of that genre is its speculative nature. It asks us the questions, if these events happened in this way and what effect would it have on society or on individuals within it? How would we react? <br /> <br /> As for the influence, this film projects those speculative sciences that make science fiction unique as it is and keeps us asking important questions.
