First of all, let me say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year, because I knew that Angelina Jolie was in there and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the film. In any case, no video store took him but he was short and saw the local library. I looked at it and absolutely loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes but it was done well and fun. It was not degrading in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress has done a great job. I laughed a lot about sexual humor. Overall, I think this film is worth seeing if you find it. It's adorable and simply fun to watch. I rarely classify films as 10 but I give one to 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Go and find it and watch it!
