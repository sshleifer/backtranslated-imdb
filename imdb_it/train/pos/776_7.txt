I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect to explore first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and secondly, as someone else wrote in a commentary, the implications of this type of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... to start with the second aspect ... long story short, it wasn't visible at all ... <br /> <br /> like the first one .. like I said, it had a lot more potential ... I think that kind of relationships bring a lot more tension ... a lot more tension ... and the potential tension hasn't gone away ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack would have could have been more than those few songs in the background and the theme (which was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments) ... yes ... I could feel the absence of a better soundtrack .. <br /> < br /> the actors ... I think they were somewhere between 7 and 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in key moments ... <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10. ... mostly for the story
