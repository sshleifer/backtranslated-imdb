Pegg has had some successes in recent years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, a movie on "Hot Fuzz 2007", at the beginning of 2008 he released with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now this comes, "How To Lose Friends and Alienate People ", which is in many ways one of my favorite comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a failed magazine that makes fun of celebrities mostly because he is not one of them. In any case, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played By Jeff Bridges) invites him (Out of nostalgia) to work on his magazine. Sidney is obviously aroused and moves to America, where he meets a girl who is currently writing a book, and follows its hilarity. <br /> <br /> This film is fantastic and I hope it comes out more in the near future. Pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and I can't wait to see the third part of the "Paul" blood and ice cream trilogy. Rate this movie 81%.
