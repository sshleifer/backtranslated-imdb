Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a fan. She becomes increasingly disappointed with reality, and as a result her emotional turmoil intrudes on her work as an actress. In the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything, but still manages to involve her audience, makes the film interesting (even if a bit self-important) as a parallel to the struggles of Cassavettes as a director. There are so many ideas thrown around, and as a result it gets a bit confusing (I'm still thinking about the relationship between dead fans and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented in their most raw form makes it a constantly interesting and stimulating film. It would be great with a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
