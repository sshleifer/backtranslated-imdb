Written by the writer who wrote the excellent series of murders that recounted the adventures of ACD with Dr. Joseph Bell, I could not wait and this did not disappoint me. It was rather slow, with much emphasis on Doyle's frustration in Sherlock Holmes that was very accurate and well represented. It was an interesting study of the character and very well shot (on digital video, unusual for a period piece). The acting was excellent in the round, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who played ACD, whose name I don't remember, impressed me endlessly. An excellent study of the character that has roughly the same amount of twists of any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See this if you have the chance
