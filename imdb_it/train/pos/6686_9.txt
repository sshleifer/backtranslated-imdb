This film was a brilliant concept. It was original, written in an intelligent way and of great appeal to those of us who are not true collectors of "conformist" films. Don't get me wrong: there are some great movies that have a great appeal, but when you move around watching a movie based on "everyone else is watching" - you know you're either tween or you don't really have an opinion. This had subtle humor - although most people probably only looked at the obvious. The actors played their characters with ease and I thought there was a lot more "personal" personality in this movie. It has appeal for children, as well as for adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not full of sexual references and countless drugs! A great film, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This is a forced purchase.
