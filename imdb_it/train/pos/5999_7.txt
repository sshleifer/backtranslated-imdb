This is a strange film for me, because after reviewing a good film by a new director (Phil Mucci's FAR OUT), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film , THE CURE. Normally I don't review films this way, but what the hell - I love shorts and I can't wait to see another one. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that while I liked THE CURE, I was not enthusiastic about it and let Jafri know. To his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway - giving him my honest assessment. <br /> <br /> The film has a tremendous style and, as far as Jafri's direction is concerned, it is exceptional - especially for a film so inexperienced creator (it's his first film). The combination of exceptional choices of color, rhythm and music that are well suited to the film has created a great sense of atmosphere. You are really involved in the film and this is a credit for the making of the film. However, the thing I didn't love was part of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was too easy to predict. I would have loved the finish if it was more of a surprise or an unexpected turn. However, considering that this film is of someone who should not be able to make such a professional film due to his experience, it bodes well for his future. Good job.
