The film did not work well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in preview. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the movie where past players have moved into. <br /> <br /> It is not the best film ever screened, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with her role. <br /> <br /> The best line of the film at the beginning, from the character of Robin, Jack: "I was that SOB!" Cleaned up here not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> He was happy when it came to DVD a few years ago in the wide screen / letter box format. <br /> <br /> I am not a fan of soccer or a true sports fan. But you don't need to be one who likes this movie.
