A strange, witty and wonderful representation of family life! The writer Andrew Marshall wrote something funny, premonitory and sometimes scary! Yes, don't be fooled by the cheerful melody of 2point4 and the sparkling characters; the show has a dark side, and sometimes it can be quite chilling. And that's what's so beautiful about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2D comic device (the case of My Family). Instead the characters are completely rounded individuals that show the roller coaster of human emotions. Occasionally dark moments like Bill, presumably haunted by a curse, and Ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show that take a surreal, dark turn, which helps add some depth. Obviously the show is also incredibly fun, and it's guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame that Eureka Video has stopped publishing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get hold of in-store episodes.
