The sparkling Elizabeth Taylor plays in this lesser-known classic of a London girl who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Upon arrival he immediately feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture, as well as being constantly aware of the herd of angry elephants. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat obscure and almost disturbing novel to this love story and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with black and the white themed villa and the beautiful scenery of the island.
