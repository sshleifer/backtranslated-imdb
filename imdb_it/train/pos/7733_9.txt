The noir quality of Foley in this film of saturated and intense pulp is apparently "perfectly" in shape. Shot on target, modified by modification, the film develops around a disturbed boxer who discovers his purpose (or lack thereof). Other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest, but personally I think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece!
