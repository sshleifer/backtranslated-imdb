I saw this movie after seeing Paltrow's version. I found the one very good, and I thought it wouldn't be as good ... but I was wrong: the English version was much better and fun! I found Jeremy Northam more "agreeable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong captures Austen's Knightley much better. However, both versions are good, but anyone who loves Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * Caalling *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things, but remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
