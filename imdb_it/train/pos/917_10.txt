I saw it in July and even with the Christmas theme, I found it touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality-mind as it is full of fantasy and pleasant moments that sometimes make no sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I only saw him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer in which he played a weak character. But in this, the expression in his eyes, while Hank considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and kind as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk like Max was splendid and always smiled when he appeared in a series of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including one in which Hank understands who Max really was in his life. It is not for everyone ..... especially those who are not in "wellness" films and this is definitely one! If you like that everything is perfect and sensible, avoid this. But I think it's worth seeing him again, and that's why I recorded him. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. :)
