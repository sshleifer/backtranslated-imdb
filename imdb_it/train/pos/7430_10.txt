Personnaly I loved this film and it particularly moved me. The two main actors are giving us great performances, which in the end is really heartbreaking to know what happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and the song is just as fantastic as they are. <br /> <br /> That's why I wasn't surprised when I learned that he had won 5 Golden Globe awards (the most awarded film at the Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This film is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A great film, which has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand had the courage to get involved, certainly as a "co-director"). His artistic talent is the greatest, and this will surely please you!
