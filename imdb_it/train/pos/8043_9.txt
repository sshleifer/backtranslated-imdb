I've heard people say that this movie is dull boring. I don't think they were watching the right movie. This is not the prototype action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about the novice and his mentor who seems to be killing people. In this way it works very well, with extraordinary interpretations of Berenger and Zane (who does not sleep in the film as he did in other roles - it really seems to play). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action towards the end - a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the accumulation from the rest of the film. But look at Zane's face as he panics, alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
