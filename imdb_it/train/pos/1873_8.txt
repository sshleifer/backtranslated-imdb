The violent and rebellious 25-year-old sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) is sent to three sessions for evaluation with Navy psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another outburst and aggression against a higher-ranking navy. Reluctant at the start of treatment, he becomes familiar with Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing painful traumas generated in his adoptive home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love with each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a moving and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a normal life. Denzel Washington's management is excellent, making a story about child abuse sensible, attractive and tasteful. In the hands of another director, it could be a very heavy story. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Turning to Viver' ('Returning to Live')
