I saw this film a few years ago and I said that I really liked it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. Director? I don't have too many things about him ... and I don't. My script is good, that's for sure. In a nutshell I have to say about this movie that is strange, strange, even obscure, but it's good. I saw it a few years ago and I've never seen it since. I want to see it again and again. I know I won't get tired of seeing it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is good. The film should have lasted longer. I think that 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for part 2 for this movie. Too bad it didn't happen. Jason Patric: you are the man! great movie. the end. :-)
