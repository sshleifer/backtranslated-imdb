Bela Lugosi has appeared in many of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then draws fluid from their bodies so they can keep his old wife looking young. After a journalist and a doctor spend the night at his home and discover that he is responsible for the death of the brides, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and falls dead shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> You have almost everything in this film: the scientist's assistants consist of an old crone, a hunchback and a dwarf (his children), a storm and ghostly passages in the house of Bela. Bela and his wife find that they sleep better in coffins than in the movie beds. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes deserves a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
