After seeing You Got Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to watch the original film that inspired this, The Shop Around the Corner. I was stunned by this movie. It is a real gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that, if you haven't seen it, I would like to urge you to see it today. I'm not against the re-make and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time I have to admit that You Got Got Mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
