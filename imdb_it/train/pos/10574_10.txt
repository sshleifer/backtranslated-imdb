This is a wonderful film. The non-stop patter requires several guards to fully appreciate. Busby Berkeley's musical productions will never be duplicated. I think this movie easily overcomes all its other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some of the moods would almost push the boundaries of today's movies. Put rational explanations on how they set it aside and enjoy it for the show it is.
