I give this movie an A + for pure and simple camp! Dietrich's daughter, Maria Riva, wrote in her book about her mother: "If you see Allah's Garden in the context of the high camp, it can be a lot of fun." And how! I laughed with joy at the exaggerated music and incredibly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Spectators who have read the stories of Boyer's toupee (he continued to unstuck himself in the heat) laugh when he makes an appearance. Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when they give their jokes - instead they look dreamy in the distance, presumably so that their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you are acting in a turkey it might even look beautiful! ). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva observes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Banton from Paramount and let him design some of the most divine dresses, such as the beige chiffon dress and cape. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other reviewers that enthusiasm for Technicolor. It's really hard to believe that the film was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at Allah's garden with a forgiving attitude and embrace his stupidity, you can't Help but have fun.
