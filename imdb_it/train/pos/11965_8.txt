Reading a wide range of "Scoop" reviews in the past few days, I entered the theater prepared for a Woody outpart. Fortunately, I could not have been more wrong. Sure, Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but Woody the writer / director is in great shape - and he found a credible way to integrate his 70-year-old self into history. Judging by the laughter and laughter, the audience ate Allen's jokes and dialogue in a way I hadn't seen for several years. <br /> <br /> In a cinematographic panorama dominated by software-approved narrative arcs, tastes for twenty-year-olds and assembly formula for children, it is a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his personal and yet rewarding path .
