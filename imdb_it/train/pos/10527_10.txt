This is one of the best movies I've seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's excellent like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is as superb as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is as hysterical as Miss Bates. And check out the wonderful Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Anyone who has said that you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen Emma. I think that's what sets it apart from many others - it's classy. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, or look for a love story for yourself, look no further. Emma is that movie. With a beautiful setting, beautiful costumes and an exceptional cast (did I mention the beautiful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
