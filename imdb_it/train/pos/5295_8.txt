I thought it was an absolutely fascinating film. History seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is fine in the head, but the best performances are from his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and, of all people, Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are far from that. They seem to take Pecker's worst assessment of his gospel work, when I think the film clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist.
