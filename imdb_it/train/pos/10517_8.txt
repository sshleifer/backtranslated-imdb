Sumptuous productive values ​​and solid performance in this simple adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classic on marriage play within and between the classes of 18th century provincial England. Northam and Paltrow are a healthy blend of friends who have to go through jealousies and lies to find out they love each other. Good humor is a virtue of support that is very useful in explaining the accessibility of aged source material (which has been somewhat attenuated in its harsh skepticism). I liked the look of the film and the way the shots were made, and I thought it didn't depend too much on the successions of headshots like most other films of the 80s and 90s. Excellent results.
