There are many police dramas that make the rounds. I'm not sure why. It probably has to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a rough recruit, into a police team stationed in the Baltic area. No attempt is made to fascinate the police. They are truly on earth, sometimes hard and implacable, but Anna has a tender heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all the rules it sometimes holds back the incriminating information found in your research on the stripes and in other surveys. <br /> <br /> This is not a pleasant film. Not one to relax. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. The police appear to be involved in a lost battle. Tomorrow there will be more bombings, more murders, more family breakups and more children in difficulty. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. <br /> <br /> As the days go by, Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character Benny, a 12-year-old child from a destroyed family. Anne has her own way of fixing things. She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him in the best possible way. I was surprised that she came to seduce Benny's father. He asked me if he was considering his father or his needs. After all, the film makes it clear that she desperately needed a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
