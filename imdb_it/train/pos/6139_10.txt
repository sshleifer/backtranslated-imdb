A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a special mention for the "Portobello Ballet" are stunning. As for the animated section, the game between animals has become an instant classic; the climax with the attack of the armor is chilling and fascinating. I recommend seeing the restored 134-minute version or at least the 112-minute video. Here in Italy we have only the 98-minute version, although the film was presented in its original version with a duration of 117 minutes. If possible, look also at the German videotape: it was generated from the 98 consecutive minutes, but all references to World War II and all the scenes between the British and their Nazi invaders are missing!
