"The Mother" is a strange low-budget film that touches on at least two uncomfortable themes that are not usually explored in the cinema: the denial of love for the mother for her son and daughter, and the lust and passion in the third age. <br /> <br /> The characters are horrible: May is a disgusting old lady and I think it's impossible to feel any kind of pity or regret for her. He confesses that he does not love his son and his daughter. He betrayed her husband twice with an intellectual. He steals his daughter's beloved man, not to protect her from a boy with no morals, who doesn't love her, but only because he feels excited with him. He is trying to organize his life after the loss of her husband in the worst way, destroying her daughter's illusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life as it is. His brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings due to his wife, who insists on having his shop, a really terrible affair. Darren is an amoral moron who doesn't love anyone, even himself. <br /> <br /> Acting and directing are excellent: actresses and actors have exceptional performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I recognize that it is recommended for a very specific audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
