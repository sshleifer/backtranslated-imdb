I really enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives an idea of ​​the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is very rarely covered in films, most of which speaks to us of the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they gave very honest and convincing representations of a very shabby underworld that not many people hear outside my native shores. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun gas movie with stellar performances of who's who in the cast of Northern Irish actors. It will not move the earth, although it may slightly open the eyes of some people to the dark world of loyal paramilitaries.
