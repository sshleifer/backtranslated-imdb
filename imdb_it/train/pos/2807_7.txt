I caught the last half of this movie on a cable one night and was struck by how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims has deteriorated, the camera continues to function. the persistent blows of his corpse are discovered and his figure of concentration camp being compressed in a body bag are both moving and depressing. don't watch this movie if you're already depressed. then again don't look at it if you feel really good.
