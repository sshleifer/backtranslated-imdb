I saw this film on Turner Classic last night, for the first time ever, and I loved it. I like many of the older films, mostly due to the absence of all the obscene language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most movies today. I also think that they have been done much better in many cases (but not all). Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorites. I thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch and I loved it. If you feel the same way about older movies, I don't think you can go wrong with this movie. I think "You've Got Mail" is a remake (albeit slightly different and also a very nice movie) of this movie. For a relaxing evening with a film, don't be ashamed if your children or anyone walks during your vision, take this or take it on one of the classic movie channels.
