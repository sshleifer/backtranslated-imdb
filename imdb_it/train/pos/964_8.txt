"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film by Takashi Miike, but as one might expect, it's probably a bit too dark and scary for the younger ones. However, older children may very well eat it, ie if you play it in English. <br /> <br /> The story is about a boy who moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce. During a village festival the boy is chosen as "Kirin rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, bad deeds are at hand as a woman in a white miniskirt, go-go boots and a beehive hair-do, join an evil Yokai to transform the resentments of the people and objects discarded against them. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that goes to the same City of Rage, Tokyo. A pretty funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city ... one says, "Oh, it's just Gamera". <br /> <br /> The boy has befriended Yokai, who are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, who have isolated themselves from humans, and all the Yokai of Japan come together to fight evil. <br /> <br /> Miike & crew took Yokai's 60s / early 70s movies and turned them into a modern action movie for kids (older) that also combines strange mechanical monsters that they made me think of "Transformers". The look and the look of the film is fantastic, the effects are fun, and part of the humor will jump right over the heads of the children, but anyway, the bigger ones could have fun. As for adults, there's not much here, if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies you'll have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Fantastic and fun things, sometimes even dark but maybe it's just Miike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
