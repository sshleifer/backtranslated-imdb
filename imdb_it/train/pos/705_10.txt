I came across An Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for independent and unusual films, and happy to say that it didn't disappoint. This crazy half hour made me think all the way, and the ending was excellent - one of those NOOOOO moments that really are with you. I showed it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree. The little girl from the ghostie was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She silenced me, I can say so much. Nanavati did a great job putting this together. All the pieces have fallen into place and we can say that she is a great writer from what she did with this script. SO well written It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The direction was great and the acting was pleasant, but the most important factor here is the strength of the script. Good job to this girl, I can't wait to see more!
