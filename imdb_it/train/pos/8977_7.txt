Like a movie this is barely a 4, but for movie fans from the 1940s, it's almost a must-see and values ​​a 9 as a variety show! I was attracted to watch this from the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the extraordinary performance of Doris Day. Outside of "Calamity Jane", I never saw her put on a song better than her. Even Randolph Scott is memorable, even if he doesn't see much time on the screen. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was pretty sure that Humphrey Bogart had appeared. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If you ever appear on a TV station near you, make sure you follow the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
