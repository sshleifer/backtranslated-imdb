Or released on DVD or projected on a cable channel like Amer. Life network TV. I watched another favorite, "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea", as well as "Lost in Space" and Land of Giants ". They showed them forever but they are not receptive to suggestions for other shows. My father and I were great fans because I was already a big fan of science / electronics, (still I am) and my father was an old friend of Nader, both of them attended Oxy together, I still have memories of some episodes even though I was only 9. More than any other show.I think it was televised on Sat. after "Bonanza". Some of the episodes I remember are those in which he takes the experimental drug that slows down the action, the body surfs with the older ones, (I did me too!) or one in which there was a cave in the mine and transmits how to use mind control to slow the breathing of trapped people entering a trance state, a show I would like to see again, I got my wish with the 'original' Outer Limits "and" Sci-Fi Theater ...
