No hidden programs. Pure Scifi. All fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and I was pretty scared. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be appreciated more than the new one I saw and I forgot. The original, starring the great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and unique version that anyone should see. <br /> <br /> The production of the film is dated, but the fx used to make the Blob stands stand the test of time. I was convinced that this thing was moving on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
