I loved this film since its debut in 1981! I've lost track of how many times I've seen it! Never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if I feel down. The three protagonists are fantastic and the script is priceless, in addition to how you don't nostalgically listen to the acronym? I think I mention this film without realizing it. Basically, I know the whole script, so when someone looks at it for the first time, I have to stop myself to say something about how fun the next line is. I can't even narrow it down, though, Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable. The famous "I'll warn the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. The scene of Arthur, who will soon become the home of the boyfriend's father, is a scream, particularly his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
