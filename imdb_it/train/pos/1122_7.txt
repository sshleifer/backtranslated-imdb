Four teenage girls go to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls is witness to a brutal murder in the woods. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant low budget surprise. The cast is pleasant enough, the direction is constant and the violence is particularly unpleasant and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is rather gloomy. The murderous sheriff has no one-dimensional character, a couple of scenes seem to feel remorse for what he did. The subplot that involves the two boys they meet in the dinner is not going anywhere, but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
