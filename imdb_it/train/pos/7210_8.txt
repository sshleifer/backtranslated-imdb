New York playwright Michael Caine (in the role of Sidney Bruhl) is 46 and fades quickly; as the movie opens, Mr. Caine's latest games flop on Broadway. TV reviewers make fun of Caine and get drunk. Coming out on the Long Island Railroad, Caine lands in Montauk instead of his residence in East Hampton. Eventually, arriving home, Caine is comforted by his wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunate wife, an unfortunate cardiac patient. There, Caine and Mrs Cannon discuss a new comedy called "Deathtrap", written by the young hunky Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believes that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the success needed to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is set for a wicked and amusing". <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long success on Broadway doesn't stray too far from its scenic origin. The cast is fun and the twists and turns are still exciting. One thing that didn't work (for me) was the end of the curtain call; surely, he played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances are dead - but, in hindsight, the greeting that Reeve gives to Caine at East Hampton station should have been simplified into a smiling "Ciao". The location is not exactly East Hampton, but the windmill and the pond look similar. And the very animated love scene is incredibly warm. But the drama was so beautiful, "even a talented director can't ruin it". And, Mr Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
