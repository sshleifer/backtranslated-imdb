What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" has literally redefined television as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is impeccable, writing, directing and, above all, acting. Watching this show you will find yourself understanding that these characters are NOT real. Acting makes you think there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not just about violence, it's about business, family and many deeper things that depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I don't like it when people refer to the show, a show about the mafia. For me, it's a family show. A family that, through the generations, happens to be part of the crowd. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from extraordinary acting, magnificent narrative lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different.
