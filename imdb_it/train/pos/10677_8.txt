This film was the first British teen film to face the reality of violent rock and roll society, rather than being a lucid parody of the teenage life of the 50s. In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool junior liaison officers, the opening title indicates that 92% of potential delinquents, who have been treated under this regime, have not committed a second crime. However, this becomes only a pretext for the following adolescent drama until the end of the film, where we are told that we should not feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents, however confused they may seem. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly assumes the office of juvenile liaison officer. This hard-boiled character is a typical Baker role. Having currently been on the trail of a notorious incendiary known as the firefly and does not appreciate the distraction of the transfer. However, as in all good police dramas, he returned to the starting point from an extraordinary turn of events, returning to his initial investigation. <br /> <br /> His first case takes him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by his royal brother and sister sister), who have committed a minor theft. Here he meets Cathie (interpreted satisfactorily by Anne Heywood) their older sister with whom she eventually becomes emotionally involved. It soon becomes evident that the squalid environment of these estates in urban centers is a fertile ground for juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> The eldest brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the head of a rock and roll band of thugs. McCallum makes a catchy glance like the mixed American boy, who owes more to Marlon Brando than any other British star. Brando Johnny's character of "The Wild One" is reminded that he led a band of leather biker rebels in the same way that Johnny of this film leads his band. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the preaching of Dearden's earlier dramas like "The Blue Lamp" earlier is not so obvious. Instead we are presented with several well-designed characters on both sides of the law, while the drama of delinquents and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker are at the forefront. <br /> <br /> The plot, although sometimes predictable, offers some memorable scenes. The disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had takes place in a scene where Johnny indulges in music, leading a threatening advance to police sergeant. The most memorable piece of film is the climate class scene in which a group of terrified children, including Mary and Patrick, are held hostage by Johnny. Obviously in the light of the Dumblaine massacre in real life this scene seems all terrible. Understandably this is why the film is rarely broadcast or available to the modern public.
