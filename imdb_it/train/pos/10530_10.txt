What a delightful film ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by the lush, emotional and dreamy music of the Oscar-winning composer RACHEL PORTMAN, this film remains a pure delight that deserves to be seen more than once a year . <br /> <br /> Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was as fantastic as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the film was MISS BATES !!! She was hypnotizing to look, you find yourself on the edge of your seat hanging from her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I've met for centuries. From one of the opening scenes when he thanks Mr. Woodhouse for sending "that lovely quarter pork hog ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" screams in her daffy and clearly hearing-impaired mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law) who seems desperate and lost. <br /> <br /> The comic ways that Emma would have avoided Miss Bates's grids himself for a truly heartbreaking picnic scene when Emma insults Miss Bates for taking her cruel heart. Then we see poor Miss Bates stutter and on the verge of tears and just so squashed you can't help but feel your heart ripped from her for her. It's a classic scene, one to rewind and play over and over again ... <br /> <br /> The ending is right there with "Sense & Sensibility" and provides one of life's biggest lessons on how we should get married my best friend ... <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> I LOVED IT!
