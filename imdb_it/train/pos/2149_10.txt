Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly credible. The score is so moving, it led me to cry. The choreography was beautiful without looking athletic. Mai's graceful dance and charm gave me goose bumps. Tamako is an extraordinarily delightful character. You can almost see the enchanted student in the face as she remembers seeing "The king and me". Aoki's character is both exhilarating and pitiful. Masako is so extraordinarily natural as his bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a keeper.
