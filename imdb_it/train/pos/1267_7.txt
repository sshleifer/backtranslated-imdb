JUST CAUSE is an imperfect but dignified film held together by strong performances and creative writing (although extremely predictable). Sean Connery is a crusader against the death penalty introduced to save a young man of seemingly innocent color (Blair Underwood) from the definitive penalty. To fix things, Connery ventures to the crime scene, where he has to deal not only with the passage of time, but with an intriguing sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Twists and reversals abound - some surprising, others not - as the old crusader attempts to unravel the mystery. The resounding ending is a bit ridiculous, but JUST CAUSE is worth a look at a slow evening.
