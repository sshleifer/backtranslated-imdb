There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are detective crime crime series. Profiler looks crunchy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler graphics are quite simple. The plot of Fortier is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to identify the similarities ... The main character is weak and weird, but has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about enjoying yourself? Even the funny thing, the people who write Fortier seem American but, on the other hand, claim that they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and fun. Acting is not superficial at all ...
