My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. The cinema and alternative cinema (small room, with uncomfortable seats, the audience had to wait while the films were changed) were perfect. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of clich√©s in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really fun. Even the sound was brilliant (sometimes it's stronger than the dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved the way the post-war time was presented. Really fun! <br /> <br />
