Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of oppression by fundamentalist regimes, it has no problem creating exciting subjects. Panahi has a different approach this time with a mix of ironic comedy and a catchy and unprofessional cast. While continuing to convey his message about what he sees as inherently wrong in his country, he does so without the need for a heavy storyline. It is a positive view of a country, especially its people, which the Iranian population desperately needs. The biggest sin is that it will not be released nationally. The insular, paranoid Iranian government asserts that this film producer has only succeeded abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up among the revolution and seeing academics, artists and educated people "disappear" over the past 25 years, he has shown great courage in continuing to work out there. The realism achieved by shooting the current World Cup qualification really transports you to the event. The fact that he shot it on 35mm is surprising, since most would only attempt this project using a digital format. It sounds fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors really works in this film too. Beautiful all-round performance. After seeing many films showing the problems that Iran has and also the media reporting the facts, we can tend to demonize both the people and the government. This film does the opposite. He shows us that they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and at the absurd rules of sharia, perhaps a change for the better is not too far away. Some call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I think he only fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran. Independent young women.
