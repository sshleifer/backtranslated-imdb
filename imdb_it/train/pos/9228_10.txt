Waiting to see another Nunsploitation film with a bad Mother Superior who abuses and tortures her accusations, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated. <br /> <br /> Actually it has a feminist plot, although I don't think such a term existed in the era in which the film is set. Certainly it was not practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) are very trampled and locked up in humble places in society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) has witnessed the tyranny of her time until she can stay there longer and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young teenager near a battlefield. He sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before he can, his hateful father decapitates the soldier and shakes his head on his face (big family dynamics, eh?). After this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Even if the scenes involve violence, rapes and nuns, I would consider this more a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of the ingredients for a piece of trash exploit are there, but the acting, the camera work, the plot and the music are too good to keep it down in that level. Most of the "nuns" films I have seen usually have the basic premise: a good girl somehow stops in a convent, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch who loves to whip people and / or make her their life a living hell. br /> <br /> Flavia spends much of the first part of the film passively questioning all the atrocities that happen around her. Much of her passivity was forgotten when she became familiar with the energetic spirit (but a bit crazy - she likes to pee like me, but it's much easier for the boys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not get scared of fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually work like their liberators (of the cruelty and quasi-slavery of the abbey). In reality, he is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, who impales dear Sr. Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is the death of Agatha that sends Flavia to her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... Her father treats her as if it were dirt. Her Muslim lover abandons her at a very inconvenient time. I don't want to give too much on the rest of the story, but be ready to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. This is a great movie, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as an epic junk. Also, how could a film with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I am not familiar with the other works of María Casares, but Sister Agatha is a hellish character. <br /> <br /> I have read many excellent reviews of the Synapse (USA) version, but I love my German X- Copy of Kult DVD rated. It is not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually has a little more information on the image on all sides than the release of Synapse. <br /> <br /> And there are also many lines of great, wise or amusing dialogue (many from Sister Agata) <br /> <br /> "Why is God male? The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit "They are all males!" -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid - look at them, Sister - You fear that their power will be taken away from them!" -SR. Agatha (about the Christians who flee after the arrival of the Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Muslims can't do anything to you that the Christians didn't do! Ha Ha Ha!" -SR. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless these Muslims - to put fear into these pompous Christians". -Flavia <br /> <br /> "It takes the simple sight of a Muslim to make you $ h! T your underwear?" -SR. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing Message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a fleeing nun. The idea of ​​the film was born of events that occurred during the Musalman invasions of Italy that culminated in what is still remembered today as THE MARTYRDOM OF 800 AD OTRANTO "
