I also saw him at his release in '56, and since then I have been impressed with his final scene. If this is an answer to "High Noon", then it is an appropriate and appropriate response. The notion that, as this string is directed, "The city meets" is a message much stronger than the solitary personal heroism of "High Noon". In this theme, "Concho" is a phenomenal precursor of one of my favorites of all time, "The Magnificent Seven". Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, in particular the transformation of Sinatra from the overbearing little brother to the savior savior of the city. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on which I inflicted my affection for this film had the opportunity to try it on their own.
