All Dogs Go to Heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not a big fan of animated films, but there's something about it that makes it better than any other animated film I've ever seen. The music is wonderful as are the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and in particular of Ken Page as the king Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any film musical I've ever seen. This is a must see for people of all ages.
