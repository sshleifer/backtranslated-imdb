I acquired this, one of my favorite films ever on DVD recently and, as usual, while watching it, the whole thing simply upset me. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack of this movie just made me cry, especially the song "Will You". It is a journey of pure nostalgia for me again in my youth. This is the second best result for Quadrophenia (which he also starred with Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A fantastic soundtrack and a splendid vision of Great Britain in the Thatcherite years of the sad 80s in which I grew up. The ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the film I am like a crying child. <br /> <br /> I expect to wear this DVD from a repeated view, I can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, I'm sorry for your dear dad. God bless you all. xx
