'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's most enjoyable works if managed correctly, and this production does a good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, a pre-film celebrity, is Raina, the daughter of a military family, who has a peacock boyfriend (Patrick Ryecart), and who repairs a soldier from the enemy (Pip Torrens) during a raid in the city. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production rips at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as the waitress are a little unwilling from the rest of the cast, they still keep their land. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as the parents are delicious, and the whole work is generally happy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
