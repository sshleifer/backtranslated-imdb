With everything that happens in the world we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. Not a complicated plot or a deep meaning; however it is not without substance. There is more than furious action or heart-pounding dramas. There are fascinating little shows that you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy your date. Try it you might like it more than you think. The child is really smart and pretty. The "dad" and the girl go through some slapstick routines. When a jealous boyfriend intervenes, trouble brews for Curly and known life can be torn to pieces. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play important roles such as the upper crust and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable like the duo who plays homeless homeless homeless. Their worlds collide and the comedy follows.
