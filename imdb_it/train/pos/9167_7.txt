This is, in my opinion, much better than one of the two 1990 versions, but it's still not so good. It looks dated, probably because it is, but it holds up well compared to other BBC pieces from the 1980s such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The duration of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of the book of both versions of the 90s and St John Rivers is at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is as good as Rochester, but the actress who plays Jane is too old. There is certainly room for a television adaptation of this length that has more than a penny spent on it.
