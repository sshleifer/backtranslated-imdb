Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their land, are deceived by the unconscious pawn of Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time is their story, the characters they meet and their struggle to fix things. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful vocal acting by some of the best in the business, this unusual film hits the mark. <br /> <br /> The animation process, similar to that of the cropped "South Park" style, is much more fluid and much more three-dimensional. If I had not known that animation was this style, I would say that it was traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE! You will not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get much more from the experience!
