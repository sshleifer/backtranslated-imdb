There is something wonderful about the fact that a film made in 1934 can be the head and the shoulders above every Tarzan film that followed it, including the swollen and boring piece of the 1980s Greystoke. Once the spectator overcomes the first three scenes, which are certainly boring, Tarzan and his companion start as a blow, offering endless action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is as charming and beautiful as Jane and leaves with the film. Weismuller is also solid. Highly recommended.
