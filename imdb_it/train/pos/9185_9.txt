The DOUBLE EXHIBITION was a huge surprise. It contains an exceptional acting (in particular from the underrated Callan), a refined cinematography and a compelling storyline. In other words, it's one of the best horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s. Callan plays a fashion photographer who lives the dream of killing his models, at a time when he rejoins his psychologically unstable brother (who happens to lose an arm and a leg). When the models that Callan dreams of killing actually turn out to be dead, the photographer begins to doubt his sanity ... but there is more he is witnessing. <br /> <br /> This film has never received the praise it deserves. Most critics and film buffs are content with the horde of slasher movies released at the same time, but it rises far beyond the bulk of that excuse. It is intelligent and unique, which is not something that can be safely said on most films of this genre, but it is also made and made with passion. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind.
