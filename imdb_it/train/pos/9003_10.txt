<br /> <br /> I suppose this is not the best film ever made, but I voted 10 stars the same. Especially because of my feelings in the end. Me and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something you don't hear often. We are all a little cynical and tired of sentimentality, lazy manipulations or sermons in modern films. The film's story revolves around Jane, a young woman in the late stages of the MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a crisis. This could have been so easily a boring and worthy piece, but it is so funny, human and devoid of sentimentality that it completely conquers you and is a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> The acting of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb, especially the second which is always credible and strong in its role. The chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title derives from Richards' masterpiece, a plane made of garbage and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes who live life to the full so that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and fun film that I would recommend to anyone. don't let the topic discourage you.
