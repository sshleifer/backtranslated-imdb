Sure, it's a special 50s drive-in, but don't be fooled. In my little book, there are a series of clever touches with unexpected cocks of humor. Take the dreadful Mrs. Porter who should keep an eye on the doctor's place. Not only does he steal the show, but he notices the whole film. And where those indie producers came up with dollars to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob wouldn't look good in b & w. Yes, the result is irregular around the edges as shown by the number of goofs. But with the exception of many of the boys, the non-Hollywood cast performs well. Furthermore, the parade of hot-rodders and policemen appears lively and amusing. Pretty damn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was full of "young delinquents". Once again, the 27-year-old McQueen does not qualify in the age group, but still handles the attitude of a hot rodder. The film was a hit at the time, helped, no doubt, by the melody of the catchy title that got a lot of radio play. And apart from the unfortunate final effects, the film is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the blob to return now that the polar cap is turning, say, into chilled water.
