"A little absurdity from time to time, is loved by the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful show, wonderful premise, vintage piece made with a keen eye for details. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - simply wonderful! <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it, smile a little. Have a good time. <br /> <br /> So, thanks.
