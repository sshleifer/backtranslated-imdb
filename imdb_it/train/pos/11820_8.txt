Heh, if I told you to compare The Dark Knight with a movie adapted to 18-year-old comics with 5.9, you'll drive me crazy? This is just to get your attention. Every day I meet people who complain that there are no good films, that they seem to know only the recent successes. It is never a bad thing to look for and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those that cannot be easily overcome in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews mostly complained about DT's "messy" story. But it seems to me that the plot is clear enough and I had no problem following it. I haven't seen the comics, yet I'm not a big fan of US comics, but I appreciate the film and the high-level performances. Perhaps the expectations of most people were too high about the story he would tell. But if you see a movie that unites Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what do you expect? I had a few scratches on my head and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The protagonist's role, although not as competent as it seems, was still able to bring him up and enchant the public. Madonna was more explicit than "out of breath" in her seductive role, but she added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was fun and a prodigy for himself. Apparently he is bold enough to become sarcastic in his previous roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro that punch us in the stomach to make us laugh. And many thanks to the tricks. <br /> <br /> For me it is not bad at all. The surreal feeling really struck me.
