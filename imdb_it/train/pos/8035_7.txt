Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie, and when you want an intense fight, you turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). Here a sniper plays in the jungle in search of rebels and drug lords. Life is a whore, so she gets a kind of green office (Billy Zane) to help with the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who has teased Anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but Berenger makes the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Sure, it could be a bit long - who wants to see a lot of walking in the jungle, but it's good, tense action when the weather is right.
