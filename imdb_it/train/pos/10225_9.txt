I had a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this movie, <br /> <br /> because it's obvious that those people who criticized the film never saw it, or were stupid enough to pay for it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was the Elvira show a few years ago. Elvira delivered the film with all the possible laughs. <br /> <br /> It's a monster movie ok, compared to the hundreds of horrendous American movies made. Much better!!!!
