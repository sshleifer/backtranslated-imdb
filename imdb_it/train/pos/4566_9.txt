Daniel Day-Lewis is Christy Brown, a victim of cerebral palsy who uses "My Left Foot" to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film. The film also sees Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Their brilliant interpretations, the great script and the wonderful direction of Jim Sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of Christy Brown, an artist and a writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born in a lower middle-class Catholic family in which his mother was constantly pregnant (22 children in total, 13 of whom survived). His father considered Christy mentally retarded and physically handicapped, but did not allow his son to enter a home. The children of the family greeted him every day as they went to school, and then his mother fed him and talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Fricker conveys the sense of a woman who, despite being surrounded by a large family, needs someone to talk to. Christy doesn't answer. Eventually a cart was found for him, and neighborhood children, who had known him since he was a child, included him in all their activities. The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot, and when children find out how well he kicks them, they put him in football games just for this purpose. One of the most beautiful parts of the film is the relaxed way in which other children treat it. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as Christy who writes "Mother" on the floor holding a piece of chalk between her toes. "He is a real Brown", declares his father, lifting him on his shoulders and taking him to the pub. Entering the pub, he announces: "My son is a genius". Things change when Christy ages, because she has the desires and emotions of a young boy. It develops overwhelmingly, is rejected and goes more into itself, passing to painting. Eventually he enters therapy at a nearby clinic and works with a therapist, Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. He falls in love with her. When he discovers he is engaged, he is about to go crazy. But he survives to live, to paint, to write (three books in total) and to love again. <br /> <br /> Because it is a film, out of necessity certain things had to be omitted and the characters combined. Brown has not actually been diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time, which was left out of the film. The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in Christy's life, and although we know that her mother believed she had a good mind, in reality, she worked very hard with Christy when she was a child teaching him the alphabet, etc. Also, before Mary, Christy had a 12-year relationship with the woman to whom she dedicated "My left foot". And the typical Hollywood finale, 9 years before his death in which his wife may have been neglected, does not end the story. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, Christy Brown's biopic is incredibly powerful, all the more because of two shows: Hugh O'Conor as young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as an adult Christy. O'Conor's facial expression and the way he drags his deformed body is heartbreaking. One is exhausted for him and his heart is broken at the same time. <br /> <br /> And what can be said of Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world - brings Christy totally to life, a full out, intelligent human being able to swear, get angry, embittered, drunk , intrusive, lascivious, funny and loving. A well-deserved Oscar won in the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on the Fourth of July". I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruise was so sensational, what was wrong with the academy? Uh, nothing to change. Not at all. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is as extraordinary as Christy's mother, who never stops believing in him and what she can do and who keeps her family and her husband together during difficult times. The wonderful thing about Fricker's performance is that the support, love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother. The character would never consider himself a heroine or someone who does something out of the ordinary. Fricker shows us a religious but not fanatical woman who believes that her duties on earth are a good wife and a mother. And no matter what, even when her husband is out of work, she throws her daughter out of the house to be pregnant, anything, she manages. Save money on Christy's wheelchair, get photos of her daughter and baby, start building a room for Christy in the back of the house. All part of a day's work. A performance worthy of the Oscar he received. <br /> <br /> Brown's life has been more complicated than this inspiring film, but this is an extraordinary achievement by all the actors involved and absolutely not to be missed.
