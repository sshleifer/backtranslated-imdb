Now this is what a family film should be! There are few films of recent years that have been targeted by families or children who are truly worth seeing; but this is one of them. My whole family came out of the movie, awed, entertained, dazzled and happy. We are still quoting small anecdotes here and there. The kids loved this and so did we (Hubbie and I have 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from its beautiful and surprising animation, the characters (however small they may be, and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There is not one of those with whom you cannot tune into. The personalities that give life to these little creatures are talented vocal talents, combined with the skill and mastery of some of Disney's best animators. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney, himself. I think Mr. Disney would wholeheartedly approve this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their band of little heroes could become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is a family leave the theater that wants to see again .. and buy to own on video or DVD. I look forward to seeing him again ... to collect what I might have missed the first time. (I've never seen my children identify so quickly and vividly with the characters before ... my daughter still talks about the little "point".) <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, moving, intelligent and Great fun for the whole family!
