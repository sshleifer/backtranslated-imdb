I saw it on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I had enabled the subtitles and I think SBS has provided its own for that, which, as usual, was of excellent quality. <br /> <br /> I just searched "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirms what I suspected ... the floating island of this story is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's travels", which was published in the first half and mid 1700s. <br /> <br /> However, this is an engaging Japanese fairy tale, which presents an English speaking voice. It's suitable for small children, I think, but it works for just over two hours, so it may be too long for some, even if it's not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two children trying to find a legendary floating island with a castle. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, army and spies who also seek the island, and try to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) to help them find it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are magnificent ... sometimes photo-realistic, especially the stone scenes illuminated by torchlight, or the beautiful scenes of bright and sunny days, with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
