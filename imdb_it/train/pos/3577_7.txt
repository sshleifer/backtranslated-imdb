Probably this film has never blip on the radar screen, but it has quite a bit of quality. It's quite realistic, yet you think "It's just a movie". Duvall and Close portray ordinary people, and you would never have realized that they are now famous actors. It seems that the fool of this story is a little too old to hunt down Eugene's girlfriend, but I guess it's possible. It seems unlikely that the child would travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I believe it is possible. You may think that the family problems in this film never occur in your family, but I imagine it is possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like "You think the job you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
