Very interesting and moving documentary on the World Trade Center tragedy on 11 September 2001. The main theme of this film is the heroism of the American firefighters who tried to save as many people as they could. The film is deeply emotional and quite disturbing - many people seen on the screen have lost their lives! recommended.
