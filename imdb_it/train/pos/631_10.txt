This film has everything a fantasy film should have, romance, clever wit, great acting and a good dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this film and was drawn to its original storyline (based on the novel by Neil Gaiman that I'm trying to read) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the things that struck me most is actually the way the story is contained. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now that leave open-endings and this was a pure fairy tale, satisfying in itself without needing a sequel. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Fantastic fantasy.
