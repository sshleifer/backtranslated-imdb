Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells make this extraordinary anticipation film, with ambitions and goals that are difficult to find today. They predict the Second World War and how Britain was attacked, as well as the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. Times change; in the film war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that is surprising. We even see a helicopter (the film is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists who look like Roman with bubble helmets: if you can see through those funny costumes, you might appreciate the cutting-edge architecture of the masters of the 1930s, the Well's vision of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as an archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, the one who chooses to shape reality and not be shaped by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring as the final monologue of John Cabal.
