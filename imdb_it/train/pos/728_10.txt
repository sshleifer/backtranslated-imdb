The Ramones, which I consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their unique sounds then to a terribly intricate film about a rowdy rock fan (PJ Soles) who lashes out against a merciless, joyful principal (Mary Woronov) for the right rock. <br /> <br /> Characterized by a rich soundtrack of incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in its conception and execution. It's crammed with miraculous gags (like the mouse experiment), adolescent spirit (probably my absolute favorite movie) and bizarre off-the-wall moments (straitjacket scenes). If you are looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a beautiful, dignified and dramatic epic, perhaps you should look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hi everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this is the Rock & Roll High School!"
