This is one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> If the film has a flaw, it is that it comes at you like an angry bull. It doesn't involve the viewer as much as if he attacked him. '' Scarface '' is a voracious and inflexible production like Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Moroder's langup synthpop adapts to the action on a tee. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, screams and strides, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of the inexorable fate of Tony. <br /> <br /> Not so much a parody of caution as a disaster in progress, "Scarface" 'rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.
