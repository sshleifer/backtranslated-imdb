This game was really great and a real challenge. It has a fantastic and spooky texture and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all horror fans and it's very exciting from beginning to end. The only problem with this game is that I would have liked more weapons but that's just me. <br /> <br /> A truly exceptional game for role-playing and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />>
