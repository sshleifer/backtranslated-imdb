I saw him on the plane in New Zealand last week, and I wondered how he would live up to both the UK film and the book. I must say that I was impressed. If ever the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a Brit I was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on. A question comes to mind: was the script written using the Sox as the team before finally breaking the Child's Curse? Or was it another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (strange I know, an Englishman who understands baseball) I must say he added to the fun.
