It was a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on TV. I always wanted to watch it but I never understood it when it was in the cinema. The boy was wrong. Words cannot describe how fun this movie is, featuring the creators of South Park, who share a natural chemistry on the screen when they are fun. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly one week after seeing it for the first time, I saw it 7 times !!. I'm obsessed with this, and I know that anyone who appreciates trey and matts' work will appreciate this movie. MUST SEE, THIS IS MY COMEDY # 1 OF ALL TIME
