Shrek, someone? Well, imagine Shrek in the ice age. Remember the end of Shrek? Why are you doing it. Now, imagine, that Shrek turns into a human, and so does the princess. Take it? Beautiful animation, in reality, much more than a work of art compared to the images of Pixar and Disney, who are trying to get as close as possible to reality in their drawings. Strong one-liner, some social comments that children won't understand, good guys win. Another thing: Scrat. By the way, how does everyone know that his name is Scrat? 7/10
