This film is described as a comedy, but it is not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama that describes the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was a lot of fun; much lighter than the director's dark and serious The Circle (my favorite Iranian film). The initiative of the girls and the jokes between them and the soldiers was at the same time completely credible (as if it were a documentary) and completely exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the game and the sequel was surprising. He added a realism very similar to that of Kenny in Australia, obviously a very different film. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? they were very credible. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country thinks that Muslim girls wearing a chador are different from their daughters should they go see this movie ?? it will be a real revelation. <br /> <br /> For me, soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started with standardized official political answers to all the girls' requests. As the film progressed, they found it increasingly difficult to maintain this position. When what seems like all Tehran explodes into a wild party, everyone is involved in it, and the ridiculousness of current policies is obvious to all. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice mixture of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Even though it's a movie theater for adults, I think mature children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read the subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is able to produce films of such quality from artists such as Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the constraints force the directors to be extremely resourceful. Australian filmmakers (and other filmmakers) could take a leaf from their book.
