I thought this move was very good. There were some things that were less than perfect, but overall, I was quite surprised. The court scene at the end seemed a bit unrealistic, but it was real enough to be funny. I discovered that the film communicated the difficulties in going through military training and the resulting sacrifices. Being a military pilot I could relate to many of these parts.
