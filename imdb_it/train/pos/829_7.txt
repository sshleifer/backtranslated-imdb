I have to admit, I thought this movie wouldn't be good but I immediately changed my mind. The movie made you keep guessing which direction it's going. Pierce Broson is incredible in his role as a hit man, who suddenly burns out and asks for help from a man he met in a Mexican bar. Greg Kinnear is an exceptional man, like his role as a gentle man from Denver, who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce in a Mexican bar. The film will make you laugh as Pierce delivers hilarious scabbards (mostly on sex). <br /> <br /> The imagery in this film is very well done, especially in the bullfighting scene and when Pierce sees himself when he is trying to finish his last works.
