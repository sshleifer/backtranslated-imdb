This film was extremely funny, I would like to own it for my vintage collection from the 70s, the film has to see the list again, I know this cast of characters, they are people I met over the years and they pushed me to looking for this comedy, unfortunately this was never put on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a clown of the comedy, Pearl Baily is a great couple as his witty and cheeky wife, Norman a son with an unsafe secret if he will have a future if he is out, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man. Miss Dobson prostitute with a heart and little conscience. Love, lust, weird family ties this movie qualifies for a haunted show, comical situation with a mix of events like this could and should find its way as a remake, I think finding the cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible except Jerry Seinfeld plays the role of Dennis Dugan, this distinguishes a couple of episodes of Seinfeld that also bring me back to Norman, is that you, keeping them in the nearest, it is certainly impossible as much impossible to reform the fake girlfriend and infidelity of a parent. This film was a thrilling ride to alert a taxi driver, reminding me of the incident that Kramer takes on his caddy's advice about his lawyer. (episode of Seinfeld) Parents have a moment that leaves you speechless, fun beyond fun. He is screaming at me, bringing me back.
