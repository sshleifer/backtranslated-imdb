I have to be honest, I was expecting such a bad failure, because it really seemed like they were trying to milk the original film to get money. But it was not the case with this rather funny (sometimes weird) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and he having trouble sleeping was fun. The bubble of the jacuzzi, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this film will last a while because it is pretty good for a movie on video and DVD. While the movie looks a little weird and a little wake up towards the end, it works. 8 out of 10
