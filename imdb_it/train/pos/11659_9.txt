This animated film (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is certainly one of the strangest subjects ever for a film: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic review of that story, a preschool boy named Brendan, who lives in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a severe abbot who is worried about preparing the abbey's defenses against the imminent attack of the feared Vikings, must enter in the area surrounding him forest to find materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. Beautifully and delicately designed by hand (there is some computer animation in some key passages) in a way that looks like the Celtic medieval and traditional art, and with a very creative use of color and all kinds of geometric shapes , this film is inexorably strange, but it is a strange good, not of the off-off variety but of the kind of eye opening. If one were to make the hair in the egg - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th-century Ireland? it should be said that the mixture of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film never really merges. And the comic relief is sometimes a little too broad. That's why I can't give them the highest score. But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and imaginative film.
