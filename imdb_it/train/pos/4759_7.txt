Nifty little episode played mainly for laughter, but with a clever dose of suspense. Somehow a Martian sneaked aboard a broken-down bus on his way to nowhere, but which passenger it is (talk about your illegal immigrants!). The all-star supporting cast, from wide-eyed Jack Elam (who shamelessly softens him), to sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian, so I say let's open the borders!), To John Hoyt with the cruel face (the suspect obvious), along with familiar faces like John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver). Makes for half an hour a lot of fun even if the action is limited to a single set.
