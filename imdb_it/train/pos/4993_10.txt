Unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted), but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and moving love drama set in a slum. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young that are almost the best of their careers, and is a superb example of how the director, Frank Borzage, was able to create an almost fairytale aura around elements of poverty, crime and horrible social inequality, which shows just how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. This film shows how love survives between squalor and desperate need, and is totally based on the affirmation of life. This is a true masterpiece of the period and is a film that deserves to be more widely known.
