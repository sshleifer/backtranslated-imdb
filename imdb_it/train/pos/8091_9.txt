The version (s) of Peter Jacksons are better films from an objective point of view. That being said, they are not my favorite versions of Lord Of The Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First, the acting of the characters on the screen is simply too ordinary and uninteresting with the Jackson LOTR movie. The entire cast is too run by the mill. "Are you stating that those stupid Ralph Bakshi comic book characters are better actors than real people?" one could ask. Well, they're not really stupid (except for the Hobbits, later on them) and certainly have more personality than Jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue times. And this is due to the higher acting of Bakshi LOTR's acting. Take Aragorn for example. In this version his voice is deep and charismatic and full of authority (Aragorn the Lord) and with a seasoned rasp (Aragorn the ranger). This is due to the brilliant reciting voice of John Hurt. Compare it to the rather high-pitched sound of Viggo Mortensen without a soul and the duel quickly becomes uneven: Hurt beats Mortensen hands down. <br /> <br /> And then there's Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the entire saga. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) is a true magician. And by this I don't mean that you shoot bolts from your fingertips (it doesn't), but its presence is simply captivating. He is a mystic, powerful and can easily pass from an old man to a scary person. Add to this its appearance: tall, as old as the ancient oak, a beard as long as its body, sharp eyes, a magician's magisterial nose and, of course, the classic magician's hat. A perfect Gandalf, just like in books. Ian McKellen's Gandalf, on the other hand, is simply too boring. It looks too human, it looks too human, it acts too human and doesn't wear a hat or wield any sword. Yes, a sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf marks a pair of bloody orcs that he kills with his sword (as he did in books). And those are in slow motion kills. Gandalf is not a power to mess up. And it should be noted that, while I am sad to say it, the great Christopher Lee did not bring Saruman back to life. Fraser Kerr in this film did, even with very limited time and screen lines. <br /> <br /> Before completely switching to the visual aspects of the film, it must be mentioned that the dubbing and the general presentation of the film The Orcs are even superior to Jackson's pretentious villains. Bakshi's orcs constantly provoke their enemies (or others) with growls, screams and unpleasant speech. They are more credible as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. And finally, the Black Riders - or the Nazgul. These latter villains are frightening ghosts in this - not just some black knights. And they speak in a haunting voice, which hypnotizes their victim. My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazguls chase Frodo by the river. While Peter Jackson could not help but show riders simply the hunt for the party, Bakshi launches a nightmare dream with some slow-motion scenes and a booming sky. <br /> <br /> But I like this movie more than Jackson, the latter are, even if technically, even better. And this because of some key images. As you know, Bakshi LOTR presents a mixture of animated characters (all hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered in paint. I really have no problem using real people in animation in this way, but they simply don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures. This is especially true for humans (knights of Rohan, people of taverns, etc.). The orcs are different, since they are destined to seem very distinct from the other characters. The Orcs, while played by humans with the animation mix, seem much superior to the Jacksons version. They have green-brown skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest debasement in this film is, as always, the Hobbits. While I prefer almost all the characters in Bakshi's version over Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshi you get irritating and rather poorly designed Disney humanoid dolls. And you have to spend a lot of movies with them, so be careful. Again, vocal acting is good for them too, but the actors' mouths cannot save the "diving damage" done by these little weasels. Well, I've never really liked those halflings. <br /> <br /> The general failures in the Bakshi script are well known. Limited playback time (with limited budget) and many missing scenes. So while this film covers almost half of the story, it doesn't do it in detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior: <br /> <br /> -overall atmosphere (looks more like Middle-earth) -overall dubbing -music (I really dig the fantasy soundtrack of Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of the best roles of John Hurt) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (It is not a hippie fairy in this!) <br /> <br / > While Jackson's version is better: <br /> <br /> - because it covers the whole story - visual effects and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, despite its well-known shortcomings, it is one of the best animated films ever made and captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfectly. I will give a score of 8Â½ out of 10.
