This wonderful little film has all the elements that made Spaghetti Westerns so exciting and fun: the BIG music (by one of the few ... not the only ... female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), the sequences EXCITING action (and very vicious for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenography and set design (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). He also has a beautiful story with a nice tragic romance. Actors do wonderful jobs - with truly exceptional performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a woman in a Spaghetti Western ... outside of the Cardinal in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West" ). Without publishing any spoilers, let me tell you that this film contains one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen!
