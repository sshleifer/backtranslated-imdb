I read some previous comments stating that this film loses strength towards the end of the film and also that it has a similar ending to Cape Fear. I completely disagree. I'm going to give a simple review for the normal viewers out there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What a wicked psychopath !!! I have a lot of respect for his acting after seeing his performance in this movie. I was nailed during this movie. If you like thrillers, this is definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this film. This film is full of stars and I highly recommend it!
