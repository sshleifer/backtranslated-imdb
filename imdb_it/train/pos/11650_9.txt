A most awaited film of the year 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini starred in this film. The hype for this film was too high .. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this film it also gives some spiritual messages. But it also includes the typical actions, the style, the Rajini songs. It's a good fun movie and also gives good messages. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate this film as good instead of excellent because of the script. It's a must-see movie. Do not lose!
