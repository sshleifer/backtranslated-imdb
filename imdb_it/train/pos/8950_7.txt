For those of you who are not familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "minor" films from later in his career. And, although it's not a great movie compared to many of its other images, it's not bad and it's a decent pastime - but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason, decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and detached Ms. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the book of witches, this is a definite NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensitivity to witches. I am neither the child who sacrifices nor the omnipotent variety. Most of their magic is rather limited and useless (like Jack Lemmon who uses his powers to extinguish streetlights). And, strangely enough, all the witches seem to be bohemian attending trendy bars where you might find people wearing caps and listening to lousy jazz. Considering what I think about jazz, it must really smell like a witch in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> However, the film is rather romantic and vaguely comical, but not something I'd like to run out to watch. The acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough gain to make this movie exceptional - in fact, I almost scored the 6-movie - it was really close.
