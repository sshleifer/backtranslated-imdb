When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it wouldn't be a mind movie. Instead I thought it was disbelief of the reality in which someone would have suffered a blow. And you know what worked. Kurt Russel did what I thought was a remarkable role in showing the soldier without emotion what he was. I recommend this movie if you're out with the guys and want to see a good action movie.
