After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever show such presumption to imagine that he could ever approach Mr. Brett's portrait of "one of the most interesting characters in literature". Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and I think there can be nothing else. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a close second but, he is still second. It could be argued that the thesis that Mr. Rathbone's scripts were inferior to the highest level productions allowed Mr. Brett and I would agree on that. However when all is said and done Jeremy Brett will always and forever be the only actor to "become" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this topic and we, the public, went to enjoy Mr. Brett's unique performances. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
