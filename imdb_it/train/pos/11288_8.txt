Regarded by almost all critics as the best of Johnny Weissmuller's films Tarzan, I have no arguments about it, although there are a couple of others that I thought were just as funny. One thing: it's the longest in the series I've seen at 105 minutes. I only saw six of them, but this was longer than what I was used to and, with the final action, I thought it was a little too long. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good blend of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. Primitive special effects don't bother me, because that was all they had in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this film is best known for one thing: the skin! "Jane" has never worn something so succinct after this film, as the Hays Code was established at the time of Tarzan's next film. His dress showed a great figure possessed by Maureen O'Sullivan. The naked underwater scene, however, was not her - with a resonance. The woman under water did not look good, whoever she was. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of action here. Until the final, it wasn't even too much. The finale went on for 15 minutes though, and it was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie offers everything - except "Boy" (their adopted son) - you I wanted to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan who was making his cry Tarzan a dozen times. With his pair of "lungs" it was not a problem.
