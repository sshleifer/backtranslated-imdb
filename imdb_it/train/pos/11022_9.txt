FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> You should not expect credibility with action films in which the superhero has to perform an endless series of incredible feats, be trampled in the process but recover at the speed of light and transform harmless gadgets into weapons lethal ... especially when director Renny Harlin. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has numerous resources: breathtakingly beautiful landscapes, stunning special and visual effects (the first five minutes are exciting and set the tone of the film), excellent soundtrack, welcome attempts at lightness to alleviate part of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes (Stallone, star and cowork, have the lion's share of the movie, but the excellent Michael Rooker is more than valid), a fascinating heroine (Janine Turner) and one of the most unfortunate baddies of all time (priceless John Lithgow and deceptively feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in a longer part than usual and taking advantage of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Well, solid entertainment, if not credible. As Roger Ebert wrote (another film) "It's the kind of movie you can sit down and enjoy until you make the mistake of thinking too much." <br /> <br />
