I grew up in Brazil and visited and marveled at the beautiful coastline where the film was shot. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is located about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings to life the world of the 16th century in Brazil, where Europeans were just beginning to explore the coast, which was still in a pristine state and sparsely populated by various native tribes. French and Portuguese fought for the territory and for the upper hand on the Brazilian wood trade, all the while they negotiated with the natives, who also fought each other for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> A French misfit ("a mercenario") is left to die by his compatriots but manages to escape and is held captive by a completely naked native tribe. While he is a "slave" of the chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until it is the right time to be killed and eaten in a revenge ritual. > <br /> What I love about this film is that it recreates the native villages and their way of life in loving detail (they walked naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept life in those times as it was: in a splendid garden of Eden, life was untidy, violent, full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs. Europeans arrive and bring their problems, including greater violence with better weapons and greed. There are no romantic "noble savages" or "heroic explorers" here, they are only people trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film is neither overly sympathetic nor contemptuous of the natives. From what I know of the subject, the depiction is fairly accurate and adds an air of uniqueness to the project: how many movies did you see about the lives of Brazilian natives and their first business with Europeans?
