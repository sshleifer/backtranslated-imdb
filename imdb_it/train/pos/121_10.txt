Critics need to review what they classify as quality films. I think the critics saw too many movie scenes and succumbed to the Matrix movie style. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one vision is not enough to understand or appreciate this exceptional film. Lars von Trier shows that old shooting styles can produce wonderful cinemas and create drama and tension. The rear-projection effect he uses during the film evokes and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses like color and black and white in a scene very similar to Hitchcock and the girl in the red coat attracts attention and improves the drama and meaning of the scene. The comment is superb and has a hypnotic effect, keeping the focus again on the central characters in the scene and on the actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk more about the effects, but I think everyone would agree to push this movie into a separate category, and really intensify the drama of the film. A movie to buy if you don't already have one and one to see if you don't have it. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Don't miss this artistic film noir of one of the great directors.
