First of all I would just like to say that this film was more crude than any recent crap that Hollywood invented from its bowels. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of an action movie from the late 80s / early 90s ... free random acts of violence (ie when Walken and the crew enter to deal with drug dealers to get the money they they show and kill them rather than let them live and take only their money), the snap of the hills, the burning kids, the guys being unloaded from buildings and, of course, the kids who are on fire who are blown away by the buildings. Walken is at its best in this image offering memorable lines like "let's sit down on the deck". and others who make this movie a great buy of the clearence rack in the local video store. if you have a desire for blood for useless random acts of violence, rent this film today and satisfy your thirst.
