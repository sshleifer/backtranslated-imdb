OK, this movie starts as a poor Lifetime movie and doesn't improve after almost the whole movie. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff" and the cast is not well directed for the most part. For the first half of the movie, the girl irritated my nerves. I don't think this is one of his best acting jobs. The only reason I bought the film is because it was for sale and contained Ellen Burstyn. It's fantastic but it's not even one of her best acting concerts. The story is based on real events and helps the film. Actually, at the beginning I didn't even like the movie and I felt disgusted when I saw the frames of the balloon traveling, I mean .. you ask where you have to go and be done! But everything is forgiven when it reaches its destination and the story ends. If this doesn't bring a tear to the eyes, nothing will! It's banal and predictable, but it makes you feel good again in the world.
