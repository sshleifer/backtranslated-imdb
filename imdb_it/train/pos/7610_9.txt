I've only seen the first season so far but this is just great !! A wide variety of people stuck on an island. No one is what it seems to be and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their closets .... it seems Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so big? Probably not, but then a spoonful of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and an island that is everything you've always dreamed of - in your most bizarre nightmares and you'll be lost. The story has so many twists that it's incredible. Great set up, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of all is human (well almost all ... I think ...) with good and bad sides. But weird oh so weird ...
