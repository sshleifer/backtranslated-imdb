I grew up in Royersford, Pennsylvania. The city where Jerry's market was located. I remember that my whole family went to see the filming. I remember a guy showing the "Blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share that my mother was in the film. Her hairstyle was the same as Aneta Corsaut's and she fell ill one evening and saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until her death last August. My mother was not a teenager and she was a few months after the birth of my little sister.
