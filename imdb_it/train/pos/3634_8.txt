I had high expectations for this film, but I was looking for something unchallenged for an evening. I walked out of the theater totally happy and a little surprised. This is a very nice tribute film for baseball, and a great lesson in the pursuit of your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and I was touched by his interpretation. Definitely worth a full ticket and a couple of hours of your time!
