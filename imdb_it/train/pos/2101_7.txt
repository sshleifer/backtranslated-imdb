Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half-done modern heroes. They look only 12 years old to satisfy the vast audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can't be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a group of fakes who don't have beards and yet satisfy teenagers wanting to see something that looks a lot like an action movie. <br /> <br /> However, their "set-actions" are simply painful to watch and any girl can challenge their masculinity without asking questions. This explains the resurgence of old on our silver screens in recent years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, get ready .... he didn't have a beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say it's time for a new hero to come up and end to their kingdom. This "Largo Winch" movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley offered a very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he has been weakened is when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case. <br /> <br /> I didn't know when I entered the theater room, but this could be the film I've been waiting for for a decade. For the first time in France, from Belmondo, a film can be both well-made and rooted in genre B without blushing with its performance. Meanwhile all we had to chew was a giant pile of manure or something too small to reach a wider audience ... In other words it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, mind you). .. I think "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be a popular and quality film. <br /> <br /> I came out of the theater very happy and hungry for something else.
