I don't have much to add to what was said before, but it's a film of his time and the first (and probably only) moment when the studio hung the film totally on Dead End Kids. <Br /> <br /> Warner's gave the kids a great help, from director Ray Enright and an "A" budget, to an almost magical cast of secondary actors. At every turn, we get one of those gems performances by real professionals. There are too many to list, but it almost seems that all of Warner's (without the biggest stars) cross this image. (See if you can spot John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> The only performance above performance is that of the ever trustworthy Eduardo Cianelli as head of the mafia with a messianistic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the leader of the Thuggies in "Gunga Din". It's something to look at! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role as "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My offer for this is a second feature on a double bill with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hooray for Warners!
