In no way my favorite novel by Austen, and Paltrow is not my favorite actress at all, but I found the film almost completely delicious. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays "Miss Bates" are absolutely fantastic. The detail of the period is not alienating; the feeling of the film is right, in fact. But the real "find" is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There could be no more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and human in the film. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no obstacle to fun! Highly recommended. Anar
