<br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is one of the genres of films that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the study system. Ok now that you know my prejudice, here are some reasons why I think this movie stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star, and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a beautiful Hollywood story of the period , the writers change the theme a little more than usual. Even if Lily gets her big chance when the star stops, she doesn't succeed and has to swallow her pride and return to play a secondary role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough to say!) <br /> <br /> 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truly wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the director's mother - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). However, the supporting performance goes to the actress character Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, an actress who once became theater keeper. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a watch. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
