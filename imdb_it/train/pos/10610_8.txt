A young and sweet mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) meets a child abandoned in the woods and immediately falls in love with her. The elderly citizens generally support him in maintaining the child, even if a local temptress (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A determined girl in a long walk and a sinister traveling salesman (David Strathairn at his most frightening) have parallel stories that converge in a fateful way. This is a fascinating slice of life in the Ozarks, in the same style as "Where The Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three were shot on the spot in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple American people, but not simple. A minimum of strong language and short but intense violence make this familiar vision quite safe.
