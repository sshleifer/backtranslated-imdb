I still love him for about 17 years after the first time I saw him, in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very upset. Despite not joining the original (which as a child I never noticed and as an adult I don't care), this is what cartoons * should * be. Dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be appreciated by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our children nothing. The music is fantastic and remains locked forever ... I downloaded the entire soundtrack in one place or another.
