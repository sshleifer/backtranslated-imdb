Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid success rate for their TV work. However, their film work was much more pronounced (The Bank Job of 2008 was fine, the previous year Across The Universe decidedly weak, for example). <br /> <br /> Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. It has a fantastic history, excellent performances, lots of humor, fabulous music and, above all, the true heart. <br /> <br /> I savor the "moments", and this film has one - just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance ... <br /> <br /> Hugely enjoyable.
