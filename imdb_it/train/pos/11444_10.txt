Go see this movie for the stunning images of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures and give yourself an experience of great openness and relaxation. The music completes the movie perfectly, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators have defined the fragments of the interview with the artist a weak point, but consider it: why should you look further into this aspect in a film, if you can read Andy's reflections in his books or participate in one of his excellent lessons? This medium is much better suited to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works, and is competently used in this sense.
