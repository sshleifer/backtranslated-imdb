Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (the sister) grows up in a wealthy environment, but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and eventually join a hippy movement that eventually leads her to drugs. On the other hand, Prashant (the brother) grows up in a less rich environment but grows up to become a mature gentleman. The story marks Prashant's desire to save his little sister (who is perpetually in a trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This film bears the test of time, commenting that sects and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they should stand up and be counted in the face of adversity. Great musical compositions in this film that mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director brings with it a strange feeling.
