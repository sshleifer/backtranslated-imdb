I don't think most people give this film all the merit it deserves. I love low budget horror films and this takes the cake, especially for its originality. Yes, the Scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighting scare, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. I really didn't have much fun watching a Candyman movie. So the city chooses this little boy who calls him a scarecrow, even his mother doesn't care about him. Then he is killed and the spirit is infused into the Scarecrow, which then goes to make a spree of murder. His death is relatively easy to take when the film begins. The dedications eventually go directly to a group of horror filmmakers, but with the utmost dedication to Dario Argento it really struck me as interesting people, who want to make films of a new genre. Throughout the film there are a lot of Arnold scams, with a liner you will surely laugh like a stick and kill the sheriff with a stick. I'd say, grab a pizza from friends and laugh at your A $$ discount with this movie. I love it for its originality, more fun.
