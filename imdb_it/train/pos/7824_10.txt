As anyone knows, South Africa has long suffered under the vile racist oppression of apartheid, which has completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the murder, reporter Donald Woods tried to convey Biko's message to the world. <br /> <br /> In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is stopped charges. When Woods attempts to spread the word of Biko, he and his family begin to live under the threat of an attack, and are eventually forced to flee the country. The last scene dramatically shows the police shooting at protesters. <br /> <br /> As one of the two films (along with "A World Apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" stands out as perhaps the best work ever for all those involved .
