Jim Henson's Muppets were my favorites since childhood. This film makes me feel like a child again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to go to Broadway in a musical show in other places in New York City. You will see the cameo of the then New York Mayor Ed Koch. However, the film turns 25 this year and I hope today's kids will learn to appreciate the carefree mood of the Gang of Muppets. The problem with the show is that Kermit disappears and the band has to find him in New York City. It is worth looking for children and even sentimental adults like me.
