Now I had the pleasure of seeing Contaminated Man before when it was shown on TV in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infectious disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them. Now a few years later it is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly, all I know is that it takes place somewhere in that area. In any case, due to budget cuts in an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to lay off most of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, best known for his role as indestructible Robocop) enters there and asks that he return his work. He needs this job because he is divorced and needs it to pay child support. Then he enters in there, a fight breaks out and some things are thrown to the ground, dangerous things. We soon find out that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly that a drop of his blood will kill a person in seconds. Soon the word comes out and the disease expert (Hurt) is called to investigate and later collaborates with an American journalist. Now Muller is determined to go home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing, even if it must infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now as I said before this movie is very similar to Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal even if they have to kill some people in the process. Then we have a hero-type person (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) who is both nice and determined to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> The contaminated man is indeed a great film with a nice story line and some excellent performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
