I had no problems with the film, which I thought was pretty good. It is the actual video of the crime scene of the Los Angeles police that disturbed me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY thought that the general public wanted to see people brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. I'm sorry Lion's Gate, this was an AMAZING IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: the cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes. John Holmes was a loser, mistreating women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and is hopelessly immersed in drugs. His connection with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that caused the infamous murders of Wonderland. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders? We may never know the whole truth of the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the film does a great job anyway.
