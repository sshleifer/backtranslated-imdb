No, this horrible horror made on TV for the horror clinker of the 70s is not a dessert sweetly possessed by the devil. Still, this exceptionally terrible but undeniably fun and so funny cathode rejection reaches a breathtaking summit of absolute, insatiable nonsense and atrocities that is quite tasty in such an execrable way, it's absolutely fantastic. Richard Crenna, apparently stoned and possibly drunk, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if he had never passed the brutal rape he suffered in Jackson County jail, portrays a disgustingly beautiful and respectable suburban couple whose picturesque, boring, sleepy town existence is torn apart when the sympathetic German shepherd taking while the family pet turns out to be an ancient and deadly evil spirit. Soon, Mimieux and his two repulsive and cogolic children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien cops of the Disney "Witch Mountain" images) adore a crude crayon drawing of the ugly, ugly canine entity in the den. Boy, now doesn't it sound really scary and disturbing? Well, disquieting and disturbing, this ridiculous and ridiculous limping is not, but surely it is fun, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide"), the irretrievably weak direction of Harrington, to special comic effects (not so), to a laughable absurdity plot, and a game cast that fights valiantly with the absurd story (in addition to the protagonists, both Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong briefly appear as members of a satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a useful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the evil Mephestophelion mutt puts the blow on Crenna, forcing him practically to put his hand in a wildly mower blade. While contemptuous and snobby cinema fans can hold their nose in the perfectly putrid stench of this filthy bruising mass, devout TV rubbish lovers should consider this nice feast of a tube equivalent to Alpo.
