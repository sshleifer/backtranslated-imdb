What I liked about the film adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it remained so faithful to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, I find that the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. You can tell the Stone Angel team that he was careful not to let this happen with this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was a great choice for the role of Hagar and she's definitely a movie superstar. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chosen to play Hagar in her younger years has also done an incredible job that deserves great praise. I haven't seen any of Horne's previous work, but I'll definitely look for it after seeing his performance of Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> I heard that The Stone Angel's Canadian theatrical release is about to happen in spring or summer 2008. I can't wait to see it again on the big screen!
