Despite its rather salacious title, this is a light teen drama. Unless you are an old coot, you will probably find it nice. However, it is not so nice to develop characters or situations without problems. When you look at it, you have the feeling that you're running back and forth to the kitchen even though you've been sitting watching all the time. This is one of those movies that really matters to the characters, and they are quite attractive. Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many, I know, but I've always liked the darker Maddie Corman. Kids get most of the time on the screen without a lot of intrusion from those pesky adults. Is it just me or do most young males look very similar?
