The monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the life force of the virgins, and their new goal is the beautiful but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of noble, bestsellerist survivors like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr Dung himself, is actually not as bad as it could be. Yes, sometimes it's incredibly atrocious, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old graveyard, disturbing soundtrack and candlelit gothic scene, mirror showing the monstrous form of the bad guys, etc. Of course, the film is polluted by Mr. Dung's open-mouthed dialogue and obsession with all the cabinet tactics to denigrate fat people, leading to a totally useless subplot of the rapist teacher, but there are roses among the manure.
