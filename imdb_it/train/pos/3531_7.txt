Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir starring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does, I might add, without much help from his male actors, Curtis and Tone. It's Raines to the end, a cute and leggy actress who for one reason or another has never reached the status of some of her "noir" counterparts. Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadows and music is truly remarkable while dealing with this genre. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook, led by an excited Raines. It is this scene that brings "Phantom Lady" into a new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines, who offers a sincere performance like a woman in love trying to save his man. Franchot Tone called this. Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he could die and did not seem happy to have lived. And he never, apart from a brief moment in prison, seemed to be in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that, as World War II progressed, interest in psychiatry became deeper. But often the terms have been used incorrectly in films like "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has a paranoia related to his disorder, but seems to be closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headaches, he may have had a brain tumor that pressed against his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady doesn't have the biggest plot, but it's worth looking at.
