With mixed reviews this I did not expect too much, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a very funny little crime film with interesting characters, excellent portraits, writing that is breezy without being casual, and a good step. It also looks beautiful, in a strange way. Apparently, people like this movie or just hate it, and I'm one who liked it.
