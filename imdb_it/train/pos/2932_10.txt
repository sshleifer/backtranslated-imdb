I saw my fair share of comedy and stand-up movies, but this is so original, so cool, you might wonder why you've always walked to pass it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty vulgar jokes, but it's too funny to pass. If only every movie could be so fun. should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comic genius in this film and will make you say "this is the guy who made dr. doulittle!" It's about the ice cream maker, the mothers who unload shoes, the aunt with a mustache, racism and everything else you could ever think of and those you couldn't. Please, if you've ever seen a play in your life, it's like that, if only all the movies could be delusional.
