This film has big stars in their early years: Ingor Stevens never looked nicer; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, in conflict with his piracy and eager to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a great job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a little sad. It is really a good film for students to learn that part of our story, and it shows that all happy endings do NOT include lovers coming together - sometimes the happiest ending is that they sail and find partners of similar backgrounds who I will understand better in the long run. I've seen it every year at least twice for 16 years; and although it's not the best film I've ever seen, I love it every time!
