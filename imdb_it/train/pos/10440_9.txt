This movie is smart. That is, more than most other films, it transcends the lowest common denominator - stupid people probably won't appreciate it. The story is also based on dialogue. It has some parallels with Lost in Translation, even though Before Sunrise is much brighter, somewhat less abstract, and simply much better. <br /> <br /> The script, the characters and even the somewhat surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. I have rarely seen a movie in which the script and the acting fused together perfectly. <br /> <br /> Dialogue moves to very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a bit exaggerated. However, it almost always remains on the right side, although I found some moments a bit embarrassing and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line requires outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it produces excellent results, and overall this film is simply gorgeous! Only very, very rarely is "love" in the films depicted in a way that I believe is reliable and realistic. Every time it is reached, the result is fantastic. I think the extraordinary and seemingly timeless beauty of the female lead has been a great help in this regard. She is still beautiful in this film, 12 years later. <br /> <br /> This is simply a gem of a movie not to be missed. One of the best movies I've seen since the 90s!
