What a great movie! This is reminiscent of the wonderful Disney films of the classic family of the 60s and 70s. I was pleasantly surprised, after the last 20 years of absolute detritment that the Disney live production crews have turned out. <br /> <br /> This film is an absolute joy. That was the children's stars; professional and quality actors. I am very impressed by the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was a total esophagus * insert the hyperbole here * who runs a prison camp for rebellious boys. Siobhan Fallon was as wonderful as the mother of the star. <br /> <br /> I will not find the story here because it makes little sense to do it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the quality of the acting was magnificent! This work reminds you of what it means to be a child, without becoming too sugary or too sad. The deleted scenes in the DVD version have been left really better deleted. They were too tough for this movie and they would have taken so much. While the abuse was mentioned in the finished product, it was not shown beyond a certain limit. It was better that way. <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely delicious movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Get a 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon:.
