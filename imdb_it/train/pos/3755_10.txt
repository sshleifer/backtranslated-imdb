I remember this film from many years ago. Definitely the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact of vividly remembering most of the film after so long testifies to its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performance due to the language barrier. But they were nevertheless very powerful. <br /> <br /> This topic continues to fascinate us even as the years go by. And it has been treated more effectively here, with the right proportion of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I wish it was shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there an archive of art films that holds a copy?
