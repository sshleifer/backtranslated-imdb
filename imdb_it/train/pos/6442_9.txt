It is a superb Swedish film .. it was the first Swedish film I saw .. it is simple and profound .. what a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist made a great performance as a famous conductor seeking peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was as great as her inspirational girlfriend to help him continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> The struggle between the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends Michael's noble cause to help his hometown find his peace in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was the ending .. it wasn't good but it has a deep meaning.
