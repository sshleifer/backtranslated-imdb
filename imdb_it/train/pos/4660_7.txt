"Hot Millions" is a well-written and well-written story about an embezzler who steals (whoops! - class word too low for an embezzler, according to Peter Ustinov's protagonist) a "hot million" from the London branch of a US company creating shell company on the continent and using the company's seemingly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> Since 1968, the depiction of the computer of this film may seem naive to the most literate population of today; but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was published, I would affirm that even then, this knows that it was written by and for computer illiterates, probably intended to increase the comic aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If one has little taste for this type of entertainment, the film may seem to drag it. Fortunately, it has a well-wrapped finish; unfortunately, the credits do not give any indication of the classical music used within it - the symphonic piece at the end and the flute-piano duet in the middle - only the song sung by Lulu that I don't remember completely.
