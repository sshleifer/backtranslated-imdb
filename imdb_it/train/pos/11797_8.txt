Powers Booth is hypnotic as a leader of the Jim Jones cult who led his followers of the People's Temple from 1953 until 1978 when he led them into mass suicide in 1978, where over 900 died. A very well made film that might seem a little dated due to the time period of the 1970s, but worth 8 times the 10th
