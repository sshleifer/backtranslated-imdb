The film itself made me want to call someone so that they could enjoy it too. It was extremely fun. Angelena Jolie was as wonderful as Juliet. Parents are hilarious. They are also clients and enemies. The children play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church comedy. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart. (Spoiler Ahead. I think) They sneak away after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the film. If you don't like stereotypes and the contamination of classical literature don't look. If you don't mind, you'll have a blast watching this.
