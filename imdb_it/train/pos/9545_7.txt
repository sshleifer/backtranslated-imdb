I don't know whether to recommend this movie to "Tetsuo" fans or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label some things on this film as an obvious obvious "Tetsuo". The concept is similar, the editing is just as fast and frenetic - which is good because, in addition to making the film more dynamic, it obscures some flaws caused by the low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is much more blood, less eroticism and, in the case of "Meatball machine", the transformation of the human being into a creature that is partially a machine (sounds familiar?) called "Necroborg" (very original) is caused by slimy little aliens. <br /> <br /> These small viscid slits from space actually use humans as vessels for their gladiator games that play with one another. They infest the body, somehow manage to put in a crazy amount of mechanical parts, apparently pulling them out of nowhere and turning it into a killing machine that has other Necroborgs as its target. Their purpose is to defeat another alien in another Necroborg, tear it from the corpse and eat it. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot seems a little silly and I didn't expect much, but in the end I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a low budget film, but it's still relatively dignified. Don't expect much from the actors, mostly they are not very good, but can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the blood, some bizarre situations and the way the film is directed and modified. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
