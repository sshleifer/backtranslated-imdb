I remember seeing it in the 1970s - then I just borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With a break of almost 30 years, I came to another conclusion. Most of the principals interviewed in this series - some in the center of power such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (head of the German navy) Anthony Eden (United Kingdom) - are long gone, but their accounts are first-hand They will live. From Generali and Admirals of Sergeants, Russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, are all registered here. <br /> <br /> I can remember the interview with Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 70s) <br /> <br /> This is really a gem and I believe that the producer of this series was knighted by the Queen Elizabeth for this job - well deserved. <br /> <br /> Seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" that I have given any review but I discovered how a nice bottle of wine is more appreciated with a little time ...
