My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought around 1993. I was reading the liner notes and the band said the album, which remains in a place of relief in my collection, the book by author Paul Quarrington was inspired by the Canadian. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! A surprising read! Since then I have re-read the book numerous times, each time finding some new elements in Desmond and his desire to complete Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the film in 1996, on video. I haven't had many good experiences with Canadian cinema, but this has worked for me. Claire's role could have been interpreted differently, but overall I think Paul Quarrington's vision has been transferred nicely from the book to the screen. Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance like the isolated genius. The film is about family relationships, love and the search for someone who understands. I highly recommend "Whale Music" not only to music fans, but to anyone who has ever lost something or someone, and tried to find the way back to the world.
