Paulie seems the most gooey, tearful and sentimental garbage you can ever find, but in reality it's much better than you can expect. The stupidity of the plot could have easily set the tone for the entire film, but in reality in most other departments the film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> In case you are wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Purchased for a girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on his shoulder during speech therapy classes and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent away by the baby's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from New York to Los Angeles to be reunited with her. <br /> <br /> So why does this terrible movie sound relatively well? First, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and much more significantly) he has the courage to embrace his ridiculous pre-eminence and tells a truly moving, often humorous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the plot. Third, it has several surprisingly strong exhibits, including Jay Mohr as a clever swindler, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, the Cheech Marin cigarette smoker!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is sound entertainment for children of all ages.
