Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a study contract and goes to Hollywood. Remains at the Hollywwod Hotel (obviously). At the same time, the great Egyptian star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a whim and refuses to attend the first of her new photo. In a panic, the studio hires Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to impersonate her and have Bowers take her to the premiere NOT telling him it's not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can practically understand the rest of the plot by yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it nicely) but Powell and Rosemary Lane are a very nice couple and they have nice singing voices. The score is good (highlighted by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows his unique images in a really fun drive-in music sequence (with Edgar Kennedy making his patented slow burn). Glenda Farrell also has some fun parts like Monas Jonesie's sister. <br /> <br /> The film is not that good. The rest of the cast cups fiercely and most of the humor is not funny at all. Above all, Lola Lane only tries to play Mona as a comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maid is played to laugh and there is some really terrifying racist humor at some point. This is probably what keeps this off the TV most of the time. I realize that it was accepted at that time, but today it is disgusting. <br /> <br /> All in all a film so-so with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs. I give him a 7.
