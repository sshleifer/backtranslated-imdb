I've never seen this movie before. It was shot on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats suck the blood of the villagers. Frankly it's a damn good movie that has an atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder that interests me since it was the maiden name of the my great grandmother. <br /> <br /> a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty remarks that slowly builds up for its short running time, going off the track only when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything. From that point to the end it is a straight race to the finish line with very little fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong, and in this case I think they are from a source I trust most, saying that the complete execution time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). Riding on this I know is crazy but since most of the prints that are available tend to last around 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably less if it's only 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not count for much since it is at most five minutes and I doubt that it will make or break the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever the time of execution, if you like old creaking movies, you do, by all means, watch this movie, it's a great dark and stormy night movie.
