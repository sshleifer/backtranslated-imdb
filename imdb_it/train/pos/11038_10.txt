I was hooked from start to finish. The great horror comes from disturbing images and from organic shocks created not to make you jump, but to make you go "What did I see f * ck?" All the other commentators have provided brief summaries on what the film is about, so I will not repeat what has already been said. I was telling other people about this movie days after I saw it just because it still haunted me. I also had a bad dream after seeing it, and I'm a real horror fan, not easily startled by a tripe like "The Grudge" or "Silent Hill". What gave me the bad dreams was the discomfort I felt for what I would have done if I were in that cell with those kids. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious brought me there, and it was not pleasant. That my friends are what makes a good horror movie! The best part of this film is that it is thin. It's not about Bogeymen jumping on you, alien invasions or tons of blood. It is the opposite. The horror you create in your mind. The irony for the four characters is that the horror does not come from an external force that states that it is power over them. Simply, men ask for the one thing they want and get ... but not in the way they imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from a hidden book, but eventually they may wish they hadn't. Sometimes being locked up in a prison cell is the best place to be!
