This, the best result of Georg Wilhelm Pabst's period of Social Realism is based on a tragedy at the beginning of 1906 that caused the death of nearly 1100 French miners while a coal dust explosion in the Courrieres mines in northern France it took place after a fire three weeks, eventually releasing a lethal pit gas that caused the death. The reputable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate tragedy, providing a perception of reality, augmented by unparalleled audio editing, with the only music produced by integral orchestras in the initial and final parts of a work for which the effects sound have equal importance with the fascinating visual compositions of the eminent director. Pabst's "invisible editing" mode, which follows the action from one shot to the other through player movements, is perfectly integrated in this reference film that also shows a sublime cinematography using cameras mounted on vehicles, allowing the director to move between scenes without cutting. Although the cardinal theme of the work refers to socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is contained in its details, born from Pabst's incomparable skill in weaving numerous plots in a cinematographic tapestry that arouses admiration for the German rescue teams of whose homeland is very proud, no less desperate for disastrous losses for the families of the French victims; certainly, a fundamental and completely stimulating triumph today for a filmmaker as he was at the time of his first release.
