First of all, I loved the very lyrical Bruce Broughton soundtrack, and that alone added to the film's charm. The best aspect of the film was the three animals, superlatively expressed by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest jokes, Ameche plays a somewhat endearing character (the voice of reason), and Field adds wit to a character who is always seen revealing Chance. Humans weren't so engaging, and sometimes the movie was dragged, but that's my only complaint. This is a beautiful looking film, with beautiful close-up shots of Canada, I think. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a really boring moment, and this is benefited by vocal work and a well-written script. All in all, a fascinating and perhaps undervalued film, with a 9/10 on my part. Bethany Cox.
