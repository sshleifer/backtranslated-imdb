Look, even if we don't like to admit it, we must all suppress our fears about the extreme probability of experiencing the events taking place in this film. You know: get in the car and immediately start thinking: "Damn, I hope that today is not the day when my accelerator sticks to a cruising speed of 55 miles per hour, all four door stops are broken in the locked position, both my emergency and main brake fault, my ignition switch cannot be turned off, and I have a full gas, all simultaneously. "Fortunately, for most of us, our Thorazine takes to kick before you even decide that driving a car is a bad idea. Not so for the creators of the harrowing, white knuckle, edge-of-your-place (if only in preparation for leaving the room) juggernaut action, "Runaway Car" But they go ahead and drive anyway! <br /> <br /> I am infinitely happy to have found (thanks to imdb) that this film is real, and that I have not only dreamed it. <br /> <br /> This film is, at the very least, one of the fantastic views you will see on your journey to find the Very Bad Cinema El Dorado. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
