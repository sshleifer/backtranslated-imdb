As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as possible of the history of my new religion. I was invited to participate in a screening of this film with my children and other young men and women, as well as their families in our ward. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we went to Kirtland, Ohio, in the historic village of the church that is located there. We should have booked at the Vistor Center to see this movie. Since my vision of the film was limited to only a few ecclesiastical documentaries, I was intrigued. The only "moving images" of the church I had seen were "Legacy" and "My best two years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the missionary interpreter distributed the textiles stating that several people were deeply moved to tears by this film. I thought "OK ... but it takes a lot to move me to tears". Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It is indeed a very touching and inspiring testimony to the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Watch it and believe in its powerful message!
