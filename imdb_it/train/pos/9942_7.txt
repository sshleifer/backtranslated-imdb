A good Korean film not only on Taekwondo but on what it takes to be good, as a way of fighting for thugs cannot beat a taekwondo in his sport because there are rules, as there are for life and school and this film has nuances of this notion. <br /> <br /> Martial arts in the film are not so good but they are passable and fun. Friends who continue to accomplish something they would once have mocked become stronger through the mind and the heart. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously as it has slapstick, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea again.
