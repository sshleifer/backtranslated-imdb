This film is one of my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those films as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a trivial slice of life and turns it into a profound lesson from the heart. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man bored by his social life and the furrow of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out the window of a dance studio. The moment he takes his train to pass, he is fascinated by her. But is it only from her beauty, from her distant gaze, or from a connection that both will discover that they share? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking the traditional molds and the stereo types of Japanese society, they all risk happiness and discover that joy is not too far away. It is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane showing the true magic and the miracle that life can be.
