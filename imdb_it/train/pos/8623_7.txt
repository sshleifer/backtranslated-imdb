DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit films - but it is still an interesting film dealing with suicide and its reasons and ramifications. Those looking for a gore festival, or exploitation in the style of NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM films will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is certainly an "art-house" style film, so those who need linear and explicable narratives need not necessarily be applied ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is a "episode" for every day of the week that revolves around a strange chain that apparently kills people, interspersed with scenes of a decomposing corpse ... <br /> <br /> There are scenes very well done and stimulants, including the man who talks about "problems" with his wife, and the massacre of the concert (which unfortunately lost some of his "power" over me, because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS-like band on stage. ..). But seriously - this is a beauty sometimes (the scene showing different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene, and that the names shown are those that actually committed suicide by jumping off the bridge. ..), sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (sometimes the review of SHE WOLF OF THE SS is rather amusing), sometimes heartbreaking (I found the scene of the boy who spoke with the girl in the park of his wife particularly effective) film which is more of an "experience" then simply of entertainment, as many of these "artistic" films are meant to be. However, I did not find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and I probably would have put it on a relatively stable foot with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal "level of enjoyment". It is certainly worth taking a look at any Buttgereit or "artistic" fan. If you dig this kind of film - check SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion the BEST art / horror film I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
