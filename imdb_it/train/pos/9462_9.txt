Clean family-oriented film. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to see Steve Carrell as anything other than Michael from The Office. Boy, I was wrong. He should win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out. My husband had fun and is not in the movies of this "type". I saw it with two other couples in the 30-year age group and we all agree that it was the best film we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. Only 1 word of parody! I don't even know why it was PG13. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
