I absolutely LOVED this soap. It was one of my favorites. I highly recommend it :) ... I love Brazilian soaps, dealing with real life events. I'm really sad about the end of the soap, but I'm sure I'll be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who haven't seen it, please watch it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out for the bad guys. The only thing I would have changed was the end of Xica and her long love. I can't wait to see it again and I highly recommend it. Xica was by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. I hope you all like it too.
