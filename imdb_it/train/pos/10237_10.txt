This is one of the best films released by the "New Wave" in Hong Kong started with "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain" by Tsui Hark. Tsui set a tone for New Wave's approach to the martial arts film that almost all New Wave directors (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) have accepted since then as a given; that is to say, the approach to such films would no longer need a touch of irony, if not a real comedy. "Burning Paradise" puts an end to all this, and with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> It is not that there is no humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the early Buddhist priest who somehow quickly manages to perceive the young maiden prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is just like humans, not even Buddhist priests can be saints at all times. <br /> <br /> When irony is finally introduced into the film, it is the worst possible, coming from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple, which is a study of pure nihilism as never before recorded in a film . It is the very embodiment of Milton's Satan from "Paradise Lost": "Better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he fails to get to Satan's hell soon enough, he will transform the world around him into a living hell that can rule. <br /> <br /> This is the reason that underlines the brutal violence of most of the images here: It is not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel completely hopeless, to accept his nihilism as an all-encompassing reality. So there is a definite sense that pervades the Red Temple scenes that there may not be any other reality outside the Temple itself - it has become all that is in the universe, and the Abbot, claiming the mastery of a infinite power, is in command. <br /> <br /> Of course, fortunately, the film does not end here. Although there are losses, the human will to be only ordinarily human finally prevails. (If you want to know how, watch the movie!) Yet there is no doubt that, watching this film, we visit hell. I hope we don't see our post-death lives; but we certainly feel punished by the experience - and somehow better for all this.
