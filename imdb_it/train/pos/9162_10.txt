Although he hasn't started reading "Classics" in literature until he was 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there is not a part of the book that I liked less, only the parts that I liked the most. The 1983 TV miniseries with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was all I hoped it would be. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006. Dalton's' Mr. Rochester was great, but I absolutely loved "Jane Eyre" by Zelah. Looking back at another "Classics" movie I saw recently, I was disappointed with the production, the direction and the dialogue. He was only faithful to the greed and arrogance of Hollywood. The artistic license for great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism. Using the title after this license is a fraud. Leave it to the British to get this right (among others). You will not be able to re-read the book without reliving the film with its proper context and spirit. Well done BBC.
