This is an excellent example of Bette Davis's first talent. Production is above average for 1936. I can't understand why the rights owners of this film didn't put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE, PLEASE, release it. I would buy it immediately. I haven't seen him for over thirty years, on television, but remember it well.
