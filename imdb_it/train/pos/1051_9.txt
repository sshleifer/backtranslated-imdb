This is a powerful documentary on domestic abuse in Cameroon. The "sisters" in jurisprudence are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully pursued their husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won a woman with the divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is quite long - about two hours - but fascinating both in the individual actors and defendants and in the lawyers who have successfully represented them in the courtrooms presided over by female judges. He will leave you, as he left me, many questions about how exactly this change occurred. How and when did women come to hold positions of authority in Cameroon? Have the various cases described in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women in general by their spouses? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against the express wish of her husband, a one-time event? I am not suggesting that the directors could have answered these questions. They did the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they made deserves a large audience.
