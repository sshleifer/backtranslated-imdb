"Against All Flags" is the classic swordsman. It has all the elements that the adventure fan could hope for and more in this, the damsel in distress is, well, not really in trouble. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her most athletic, challenging her enemies despite the social norms of the period. Anthony Quinn completes the three most famous actors like the ruthless Captain Roc Brazilian and proves to be a clever and capable nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventures fan, "Against All Flags" is not to be missed. While it may not be in the same series as some of Errol Flynn's previous works (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it's still a very fun game.
