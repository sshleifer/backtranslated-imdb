This film is so old that I never realized how young Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember him acting in a great movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this photo who are not very happy about the fact that father and mother separate and discover that their father will marry a young blonde who is a gold digger who only looks for a rich sugar daddy. They take a man like a very rich Count, his name is Conte Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who gets drunk all the time and has no money and makes many comical laughter throughout the film. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked into a police station and told the police chief that she was a star of the opera and then Penny starts singing with the most fantastic voice of the soprano I heard , the entire police department and the convicts started applauding, which was a very funny and fun scene from this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first feature film debut and has been an instant hit overnight and has continued to become a big movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
