My family dates back to New Orleans in the late 1600s, early 1700s, and watching the movie I knew it was a story that my grandparents had never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins, obviously blacks, African Americans and others who can "pass" like whites and have chosen not to. It's a hard story to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is part of that story. It makes me want to cry and makes me want to kick the ass of my great-grandparents who owned those plantations and I marveled admiring how my great-grandmothers of the African heritage lived under that oppressive and aristocratic existence ... And At the same time, if I hadn't gotten out of that story, I probably wouldn't be the successful business woman I'm living successfully in a fairly integrated world today. The acting was excellent and right depending on the actor, but it is a film that must be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I wonder why she is "symbolically" writing about my family and I do not. I recommend this film to everyone. Leza
