When the scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepted the invitation to work at the Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moved with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and his son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and his daughter Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) at a large modern corporate house. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt by telling him that every member of the club has a professional meteoric ascension in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. Later it is presented to the club director, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) who becomes friends with Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the change in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about Jessica and the members. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked this film that partly recalls "The Wives of Stepford", with people changing behavior in a suburban complex. I just saw it today and found a great metaphorical message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to move up positions and earn higher salaries. I'm not sure the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but I think it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
