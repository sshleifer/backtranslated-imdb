Wow, this movie has had a huge impact on me, it moved me. It's an extraordinary story about a girl in Cambodia being sold in the sex market. I can't stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The film's setting is realistic, The film has opened its eyes, I can't imagine that someone is moving away without wanting to contribute to making a change with this horrible problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very moving. It was one of the best films I've seen this year. The girl <br /> who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, tells an important message that must be heard all over the world. Everyone should go see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
