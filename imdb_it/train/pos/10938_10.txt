Rarely, have I ever seen a film so satisfying that I had to talk about it immediately. This film is certainly one of the best entertainment available and is very authentic. I happened to see the dubbed version, but now I'm about to take the DVD burner with original Chinese dialogues. However, the dubbing did not interfere and sometimes provided a really funny humor: "The poisonous clan sweeps the world !!!" <br /> <br /> The story remains faithful to the Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists as the identities of the 5 poisons are revealed and an expert rhythm. <br /> <br /> Martial arts fighting choreographies are in a class of their own and must be seen to be believed. It's like watching real animals fight each other, but interpreted by their arcane martial arts forms. The skill level of the cast is unsurpassed in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a serious dose of the old Chinese culture and I recommend it solely on the basis of the genuine intent of the film to tell a martial story of the arts and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people beat each other, along with raw forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
