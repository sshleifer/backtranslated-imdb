If you like cars, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some superb actors in the film, particularly Vinnie Jones, with his typical absurdity and hardcase appearance. The others are not bad either ... <br /> <br /> There are only two minor flaws in this film. First, the poor plot, but people don't watch this film for the plot. Secondly, the glorification of Grand Theft Auto (automotive crime). However, if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, then look at them, I hope you enjoy yourself in jail! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage had to play a role, I initially thought "... sweeet.", but then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" but in the end, after seeing the film, I realized that "... yes, it sucks!". Just kidding, he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I will conclude this unusual review by saying "If a criminal's premature death has somehow illuminated the general public of the cinema in view of the tragic ending under the lucid patina of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death brings with it an intrinsic nobility and a supreme glory: everyone should be so lucky. You can say "Poor criminal". I say: "Poor us". Voight looks very pretty!
