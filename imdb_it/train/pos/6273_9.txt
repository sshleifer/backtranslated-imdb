I really loved this movie, yes, I know it was pretty far-fetched, there's no way Shelby's car could be able to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all its traction control and other gadgets, apart from that the whole film was well put together. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast was also pretty good with the exception of the Brit Bad Guy, he was a bit too "too" don't you think? Anyway, great film, great machines and great acting. I first made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remote-controlled garage that night. :)
