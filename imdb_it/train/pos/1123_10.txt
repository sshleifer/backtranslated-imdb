I really enjoyed this, and even if the ending made me angry, I keep giving it 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are coming down to Florida In their own way they meet 2 boys (Turner, Davis), they add nothing to the plot, but they are at least a little funny. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida to have fun, but they have problems with the car and they never make it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station to ask for help, the other three remain in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere that she has no choice but to go into the bushes. Soon it shows how a man (March) strangles a woman, terrified by the girl who flees the area, doesn't get very far, but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> His friends drive in the car to look for her, they also go into the woods and meet the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls, the other girl runs away, manages to get back to the car where she is also killed. <br /> <br /> In the end the two remaining girls find each other and because they enter the service station they are arrested. This is when I started to get angry, these poor girls are afraid of their lives and police officers don't believe them. <br /> <br /> They are abused and one of them is left alone because the madman kills her in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without entering dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This film has nudity, beautiful actresses, a shower scene that imitates Psycho, graphic violence towards women and a solid story. Some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive people who will NOT like the ending, but above all, this is a small unknown film.
