I originally rented this film for my daughter because she is a football fan - and she didn't let me down that way (except that the plot interfered with the football scenes). As a dad I suppose I'm a little surprised by the introduction of the theme of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as parents these problems are completely available to children nowadays (as I feel comfortable with the subject). In a sense, this emotion was a step forward in the main premise of the film - that at some age you have to trust your children to make their choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British girl, Jasminder (Jess), of East Indian origin who dreams of playing professional football. The marriage awaiting the older sister in a traditional Hindu wedding offers many opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with his parents' expectations for her - again not fundamentally different than most parent-child relationships . <br /> <br /> In SUMMARY, the football scenes are FANTASTIC (lots of things to learn in slowmo) and while I didn't need the plot - something was needed to keep the film going.
