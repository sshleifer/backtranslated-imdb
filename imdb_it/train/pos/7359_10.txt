where would a review of the movie Snitch start? James Cahill, god rests his soul, has made one of the most daring insights on the human psyche since Encino Man. His beautiful story unfolds around a drug cop McClure, which is a name synonymous with a simpson character who is even an actor! said that the police are digging into the underworld which is the high school drug and discovers a gang war to compete with that of the Police Academy 1, and I mean the one in which Jones is racialized by his new partner but manages to get out with some of the funniest sounds you've ever heard. <br /> <br /> Cahill's effect taking, both visual and sound, is electrifying, the slight pause between the action on the screen and the speakers adds to the drama that is a snitch, a truly gritty like an underground thriller . moreover, congratulations on your brilliant use of makeup, such as the extremely convincing burn that a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue! HOW DISGUSTING! I feel that the world of cinema is far less distant from the death of James, his memory will remain indifferently on and on, reborn every time we talk about his top production, Snitch. his comment by the revealing director released a shot of coca cola on the nose of every discerning film-goer, really appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets, captured in all the beauty of a punk roughneck spilled on a trash can garbage in a fight. br /> <br /> but I ask you, why does the swimming pool of the big bosses look so cheap? I'll tell you why, because this is life in Santa Ana, it's not all a walk and the offices of the princes built quickly, oh no. there are some people who have to infiltrate the soft, tattooed belly of street life in Los Angeles to make their way through moves that don't seem out of place in the Double Dragon production: The Play by School For Special Children. <br /> <the only thing I have with this movie is that a sequel has never been done. come on Steven Spielberg, come George Lucas, come on boy who did the revenge of the nerds from 1 to 23, how hard it would be to take a step forward and pay tribute to this great man, James Cahill. <br /> has discovered Eva Longoria, you know. oh yes, that did it. <br /> <br /> Jonah
