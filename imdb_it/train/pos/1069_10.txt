I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 and 2 two weeks ago, after capturing a couple of episodes of the first season on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I didn't like so much from Firefly (also and incredible show). I admit that the second season is not so good, but there are still some incredible episodes (see Designating this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford diary, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) And Alec is fantastic. I listened to some of the plans for the aspiring season 3, and I have to say that I can't believe it was canceled - I won't ruin it for you - but it would be shaken! I also think it has great potential as a film (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As evidence of my obsession, Max's bar code number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had, there are 3 episodes away from having seen both seasons twice. It's just too good
