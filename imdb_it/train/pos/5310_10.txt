Pecker is another mainstream John Waters film made on a smaller Serial Mom. Pecker's main character has the hobby of taking pictures of everything he sees. It doesn't matter if it's dirty or shocking when taking pictures. He soon uses the photos he took and shows them to his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. His father works in a bar to drink with a claw, but he doesn't earn enough with a striptease lesbian bar across the street. His mother runs a thrift store and loves to dress the poor. His older sister, Tina, works in a gay bar where his specialty is commerce. His youngest, little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sugary food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays the ventriloquist with it. He also has 2 friends. Among his friends, Matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry as if he were a dictator. Soon, a New York tourist buys his photos and shows them in an art gallery. With the image comes fame, but the images show the unusual lifestyle of his friends and the simple life of the family. For an R-rated film, Pecker is certainly more domesticated than most previous R-Waters movies and even Pink Flamingos. 10 more on 10!
