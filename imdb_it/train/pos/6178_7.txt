The fifth feature by Mitchell Leisen as a director, and shows his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous films were dramatic. He also has a cameo as a conductor. <br /> <br /> It can be said that it is a pre-code film, and nothing similar has been done in the United States for quite some time after (like more than 30 years). Leisen took the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or the Busby Berkeley wing. What I find funny or interesting is that you never see the public. <br /> <br /> As others have said, the protagonists are rather lacking in character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie characters. Gertrude Michael still provides a little spark. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and some good (the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is fun) but the unconvincing and false drama - three murders are too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been much better.
