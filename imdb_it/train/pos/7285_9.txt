This film scared me when I was just a kid. It is not "Citizen Kane" but has its moments. The tear-off scene is good. The plot is good even if the characters are not - it could have something to do with acting. Put some famous people in the roles and then watch what you get. This was one of those shots, editing (what little was there) and distributing a kind of movie in a couple of months. This is the classic science fiction at low cost and deserves it. I rated it a 9 based on other films of this genre and age.
