This film will explain to you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one-man industry. This film will also tell you why Indian movie goers are shrewd buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the height of his Bollywood domination when his former godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of choosing themes and building stories, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibility and clich√©s. Zanzeer saw the creation of Angry Young Man. Lawaris spoke of being a bastard and Namak Halal spoke of the servants' loyalty. <br /> <br /> But then, the theme was limited to moving the script through the regulation of three hours of singing, dancing and drama. What the film includes is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a normative hero. Amitabh's vocal talents and diction saw this film earn its big money, thanks to its impeccable Haryanvi accent. For me, this alone is the biggest attraction of the film. The rest is all typical of Bollywood screen writing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comic scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This film had a good deal of them. The capon of the shoe at the party, the monologue on the considerations of Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare, The challenge of mosquitoes in the boardroom and the usual drunken scene that has now become a standard Amitabh tariff. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the film with his moody and finicky character (remember he asked Ranjeet about "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned incident "). His was the role more important than the master while Amitabh was his faithful servant, but Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so Shashi had to carry out his act with the rest of the film. It was a character that could have been more developed to make a serious film.But this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed That way, people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and came home happy.The end is always predictable, and the good guys they take the girl and the bad ones go to jail, the ancient theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well. <br /> <br /> Do I know this hat is what makes this movie a classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi Prakash Mehra has created another ic ona in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot. My brands are only for Amitabh.
