Kalifornia was released in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 main characters had risen to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006. This is a nice psychological thriller that should please all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent music narratives they find their way into his work, as with most of his episodes of X-Files, Playing God and Red Shoe Diaries. <br /> <br /> People who were put off by Brad Pitt's strong southern accent and of course the characters of Juliette Lewis never spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006, this is the real horror of this film. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the film was written with the intention of a cult film, as in Carrie's photography, it is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your tastes for bizarre movies.
