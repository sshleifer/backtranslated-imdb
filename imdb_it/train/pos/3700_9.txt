Cameron Grant is one of the best directors who make films for adults. His only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is all dynamite through the film but the sequence of the DR's office with her and two other women is simply incredible. Almost as good is the performance of Asia Carrera with the construction worker. I highly recommend this movie and I gave it a 9. It's almost as good as the ELEMENTS OF DESIRE by Cameron Grant that I gave at 10.
