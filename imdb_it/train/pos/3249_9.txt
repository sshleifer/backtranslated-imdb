Corbin Bernsen has sent letters to four criminal partners he has worked with in the past and is a true intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ and Ruben Blades. They will meet him in this dark city of Montana and he doesn't explain why, because he was picked up by the New Jersey state police with a warrant. <br /> <br /> Of the criminal group that was reunited, everyone knows Bernsen, but they don't know each other. A lot of the comedies involved is that they feel each other. Like the older Gwynne, while denying that he makes fun of the others by muttering, but moving on. Especially when they understand what Bernsen had in mind. <br /> <br /> As for Bernsen, he is fortunate to be captured by a couple of bumblers in Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He gets the fall on O'Neill and runs away. <br /> <br /> After that it is the four criminals who try to finish what Bernsen started and Bernsen who took the police away. In the complicated script, it is fascinating how both narrative lines intertwine with each other. Hoyt Axton as the local sheriff observes in amazement what takes place in his city. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a fabulous funny film of capers from a group of players who seem to have mostly had a background on television or soon. I can't say anyone stood out in the cast, but they also seem to click so well together. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people is self-involved, but they all show a slight comic touch that a good director has highlighted. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a very funny film of capers, the kind of film that the well-known pessimist Murphy would have written.
