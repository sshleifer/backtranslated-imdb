This is NOT a bad movie like some reviewers, and like the summary on the IMDB page for this film, let's say it is. Why? The first is the fact that in 1984 filmmakers had the courage to face, as one of the elements of the plot, the issue of domestic violence - so critics who complain about the plot unfortunately lack one of the main points! Secondly, without the plot element of Prince's cinematographic report with his violent father, the musical climax would not work as well - so those reviewers who say that only music is good have, once again, lost one of the points - in particular, BECAUSE it is so beautiful ... because all the music in this film has a background of graphic elements that makes the music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For producers and film directors for the first time, this is not so bad! There are far worse movies out there than people from the movies! Finally, the reviewers who claim that the music is "good" have also missed the point: check the range of stylistic musical treatments, the variety, the musicality and the performance on Prince's stage - truly unique, going musically where no one else went during the 80s and with a style seen in the work of other artists (clothes and movement: which elements were the first to wear, Michael Jackson or Prince's? Also, see if you can see the spread fingers moving in front of the eyes that Prince does in this film, long before "Pulp Fiction" by Quentin Tarentino. As the sum of its parts, it is not a bad film at all.
