Why on earth should you explore the hypnotizing "Earth" nature documentary? How much time do you have on earth, so can I explain it to you? OK, I'm not going to extend my "Earth" review exploration to infinity, but I have to stand by why this is a "must see". The documentary takes up a naturalistic journey on the migration paths of three families of animals: a female polar bear and her cubs with the subplot of the real life of the father bear the courage to hunt for food on its isolated path, a mother of a whale with his little whale that takes a whale on a migratory tour for the prey, and an elephant mother with her young (perhaps not so small, elephants) offspring migrating to Africa. The directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield have done a job "out of this earth", also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three protagonists of the animal family. Richard Brooks Burton's cinematographically experienced team, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were closed-door animals that shot the wonderful natural sites and instinctive behaviors of animals; not to mention the fact that the slaughter of prey by animals in slime has been done in two and one less. "Earth" is also a student who learns about the effect of global warming on animals; dad's polar bear in the doctor is the poster's animal boy on that consequence. So, terrestrial colleagues, it's time to make the documentary journey to visit "Earth" today! **** Good
