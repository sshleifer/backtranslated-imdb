This film may seem dated today, but remember it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin was just passing the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and had a heavy satirical humor. This film is the grandfather of all of them. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.
