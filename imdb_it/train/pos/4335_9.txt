Peter Falk's caliber performance in a role written with an Oscar. I have loved the nuanced and balanced exploration of a marriage for a long time - how often does it happen in films, where usually the film ends when a boy and a girl meet? This is a film for adults, a complex vision through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - as everyone has adapted to each other in the past and grows throughout history. Besides that, he gave me about 10 big belly laughs, and I'm one of those people who usually doesn't get excited when the rest of the audience laughs. This was one of the few really fun movies I've seen. Great original jokes.
