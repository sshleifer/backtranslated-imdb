I like Ralph Bakshi films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animated "Lord of the Rings") and I'm a collector and fan of Frank Frazetta. I'm also a fan of swords and witchcraft who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the film release of "Fire and Ice's" in 1983 and couldn't wait to see it video or some revival since then. So the 2005 release was a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with some trepidation, because I hoped it wouldn't be worth looking at it once and then putting it on the shelf as collectible "collectible" powder until the day of my death. Fortunately my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly surprised by this film. <br /> <br /> As with Frazetta's art, this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality hard to find in most fantasy / sword and witchcraft films without being shoddy or dirty. The art is good and you can see the views of Frazetta at its best. Even my young boys loved watching it with me and asking to watch it again and again. However, my wife has some objections because of the succinctly dressed princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I don't mind because it's credible and there's no sex scene. <br /> <br /> There is roto-scoping used, but personally I like roto-scoping. It provides more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that are difficult to find in the animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some problems with continuity, I recommend this movie to all Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and sword and witchcraft fans. To enjoy!
