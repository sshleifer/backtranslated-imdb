THE MATADOR is a hit movie for men and women ... if you can say about a successful movie. Violence is never really shown, but often introduced. At first I was afraid to participate in another reconstruction of the dark-gang-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy of the mid-90s, but was happily surprised when I realized that this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship . Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film, but everything makes me smile. The three protagonists have the best chemistry that the big screen has offered in recent years and it seems that they had a lot of fun making this film together. The writing is acute, although at times it seemed that the script had been adapted from a theatrical performance due to the scenes of a series of dialogues. This is a good movie that I probably won't remember for too long, but at the moment it was a complete joy. Nice film.
