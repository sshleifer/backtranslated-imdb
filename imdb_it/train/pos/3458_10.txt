The casting of Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was brilliant. Cassidy personifies arrogance, security, charm and wit, all with a condescending malevolent smile on her face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (having appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down. A new Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job with the camera (yes, sometimes there were a couple of shadows on the actors) capturing the nuances and beats in different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also, the views and shots at Big Bear Lake, CA (the home of Franklin's cabin) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this episode yet, then you have to do it yourself - it's a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and very tragic - he certainly had his best years ahead of him. Rest in peace Jack, you will live for eternity through your great work.
