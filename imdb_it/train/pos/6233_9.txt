Musically speaking, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another more entertaining musical after Top Hat if it were possible. Although in this case the packaging of Jerome Kern by Roberta was like this, Follow the Fleet kept Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is a Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is an ex vaudevillian who joined the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now the two are on the ground. Fred and Ginger pick up where they left off, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's little sister, Harriet, who blossoms into real beauty. But Randy is a typical lover and leaves him a sailor. <br /> <br /> Once again Irving Berlin wrote a successful soundtrack with production supervision. Ginger manages to make some really great vocalises with Let Yourself Go, which she and Fred later dance. But the real success of the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance which is a number made in a show of the Navy. First sung by Astaire and later danced by the couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance on this is an absolute magic. I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some young people may wonder who he was. But they will know immediately when I mention her with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. Exactly Ozzie and Harriet. For me it is a mystery why Harriet stopped singing when she became David and Ricky's mom on television. Then again she didn't even keep her name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really keep a tone. Sing Get You Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Are Here, But Where Are You, both with real feeling and class. I advise you to follow Follow the Fleet if nothing else to listen to an incredibly forgotten dimension of Harriet Hilliard today.
