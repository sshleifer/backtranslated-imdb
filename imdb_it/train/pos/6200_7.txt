Henry Fool is a better film. But this is the perfect way to follow a film like "Henry Fool". Take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the opening blow of "Henry Fool" when Simon puts his ear to the ground while Henry arrives walking over the hill is more fully manifested through "Fay Grim". The exaggerated jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about the drafting of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a bit saturated in them. Even the use that Hartley makes of the Dutch corners in the film is staggering, yes, it is intentional, but he feels forced and abused, he goes beyond the bewilderment, what I would like to call, annoying. It's an imperfect film, but a must see for any Hartley fan or "Henry Fool". <br /> <br /> And don't listen to stupid reviews, don't look at this unless you've seen the first movie. The intrigue, satire and wit of this movie are totally lost if you haven't seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel. It's just stupid.
