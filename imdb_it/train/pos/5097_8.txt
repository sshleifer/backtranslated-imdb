This is a very rare film and probably the least known by Shirley Temple as it is not on any of its collections. The reason it is probably because he doesn't have a happy ending, unlike all his other films. This is also not a musical, even if it does bring out a song entitled "The world must live me". The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and on VHS, I would say that they did a good job as the color seems realistic, unlike the colorful films of Laurel And Hardy that are terrible . The film is good for its age and the story is not dated at all, I am surprised that no one has tried to. Sometimes the film is a bit too chatty while some scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five. Don't be put off by this, because this movie has some really good moments, especially when it's Jerry Ga ry Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear. his daughter sings to an audience in another room} is very well directed. Gary and Caroles also have very good facial expressions when they are under examination. In all this it is a good movie of the early 30s, accepting it for his age.
