The 74th Oscar was very good. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very fun and light. Personally I loved his last appearance, which collected some icy reviews due to vulgar language and salacious jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier have made this TV show to remember. <br /> <br />
