Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy interprets the innocence of being just a comic book with the bad guys who have a serious appearance disorder and are fun. Warren Beatty directs and plays the main character who fights crime without even using superpowers. I have enjoyed Dick Tracy since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone who wants to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like the Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Kid Caprice with enthusiasm. Madonna as the child who is the second villain in this film does not play the same toy she represents. As I said, no blood, obscenities, sexual insinuations or anything to offend anyone.
