And this is especially true for lawyers and policemen. Puerto Rico, which boasts a small but powerful film production company, brings this story to more levels of corruption, due to the ongoing drug cartel that begins in South America, makes a pit stop in the island's commonwealth, and then north in North America. Steven Bauer, the most recognizable face on the screen, leads a cast of world-class actors, in a story of "can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd?" Ricardo Mendez Matta moves from directing mainly action movies for American television, into a screenplay written by Matta, along with Poli Marichal. The rest of the cast (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, Jose Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, to name a few) turn into such beautiful roles, in a film that will make you think "are there any respectable characters here?". Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Named "R" by the MPAA, this film contains explosions of vulgar language, brief flashes of nudity, adult content and violence, some of which are rather obscure.
