This film was a lot of fun. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams who plays all the songs in French too. The score is also uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film consists of a mix of traditional animation combined with computer-generated images. The result is truly amazing. I watch this movie at least once a week with my children and we never get tired. The story is compelling and well narrated. <br /> <br /> I don't understand anyone who would classify this movie as less than a 7. Definitely a guardian in my family.
