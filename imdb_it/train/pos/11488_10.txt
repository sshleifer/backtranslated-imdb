I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week. I had never heard of the film and had my reservations about it. Just looking at the box I knew the film was an independent film and therefore the quality would have been inferior to a mainstream film. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after finishing watching Zero Day I restarted it immediately from the beginning. The film clearly followed the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how credible the two main actors were. The first time I watched this movie I wasn't entirely sure if what I was watching were real tapes left by Columbine shooters. Deep in my mind I knew that what I was looking at could not be real, but at the same time the acting was so convincing that you had to keep shaking your head. <br /> <br /> Is the film disturbing? Absolutely! Will you see things that will make you doubt the merit of the movie? Probably. I think what most people will find disturbing is that they will really have feelings for the two protagonists, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is this problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are organizing a massacre in high school. I know for myself, I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives had reached such a horrible point. They had fallen so deeply through the cracks that they had begun a journey down a road that could have been stopped, if only the people around them had noticed their situation. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal film. It gives you a close and personal look at the events that most of us will always see the conclusion on the news. It lets you think about the lives involved. It leaves you perplexed about how people get to this point. A week after seeing this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who haven't seen Zero Day remember the following: The film is an independent film with little or no budget and the film is shot on video cameras. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not traditional Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put all this aside, Zero Day is a film that will stay with you and maybe help you open your eyes a little.
