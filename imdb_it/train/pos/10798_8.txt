First I saw this Joe Sarno gem when, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the film was moving a little slower than I expected for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer made her entrance, the first time I saw her anywhere, I sat and I noticed. His presence in this film is difficult to avoid, and enriches every scene in which he is involved. I saw most of the rest of Sarno's films and other films with Jennifer Welles, and I have to say that it was Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best. Sarno's direction in this film on the domestic adult drama is superb, and Jennifer showed (figuratively and literally) a acting talent that makes it a must see. The co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both co-stars of Mrs. Welles, and also the frequent stars of Sarno's work, become credible shows like a pair of adventurous but normal housewives. This film is classic Sarno.
