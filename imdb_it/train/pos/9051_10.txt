I was looking at this when my wife called to ask from the other room for my rate choice. My comment? "I'm looking at my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only about 5 years old, compared to the "Rocket Boys" I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our education administrators and how the whole business of science gained momentum and brought me and others into the competitive vortex. My tornado landed me in my State Science Fair, in physics since '62, although our group was less successful in getting the support of, for example, the firefighters that we approached for guidance and advice until After a tragic event, our city went so that we can visit the Nike missile site on the shores of Lake Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film has given me everything and I bet it's all back for a lot of "Uber Nerds" from the late 1950s to the early 1960s. We are now in a similar period of scientific brain drainage and we really need this film as a country. Watch it!
