Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want to learn more from a movie you're absolutely unreasonable. It looks like a late era, Carry On, when the series was no longer a flaming track, but it was even more fun than usual, think Behind or England and you won't be too far from the mark. Pamela and Denise are sparkling, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece they are doing, although you can give me a lot of things that I am told to please. Supporting casts are energetic, although some of them are not particularly good; I can't see a couple of duff turns into a movie that is already practically forgotten making a lot of difference to anything, so smile. I truly believe Blonde and Blonder are an ace and I hope you hate me for it.
