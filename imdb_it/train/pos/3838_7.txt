THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, considering that Reve needs a hundred pages just for a small twist and the tension is the last thing that comes to mind when I read his work. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is the heaviest on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely concerned about proving something to the mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what he's trying to prove exactly. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unpredictable way, quickly moves away from the original idea or plot, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on the screen and what needs to be left out. In "The Fourth Man" he is not as explicit in describing the plot as it is with sex and nudity (of which there is plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems to be afraid that the public will not understand it and hammers home the story with explicit symbolism mixed with seemingly shocking scenes of nudity and sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or integral nudity, most so exaggeratedly free and in the face, undermines an otherwise beautiful story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can cope with Verhoeven's rather obvious satirical approach, it is sometimes a fun thriller with some intriguing twists and good all-round performance, particularly Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© . <br /> <br /> Darkroom --- 7/10
