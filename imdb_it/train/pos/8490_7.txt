I recently saw this movie in my international business class. I didn't expect anything but another boring documentary (not to say that I don't like the documentary, I only have bad luck with the films of that class). Imagine my surprise when this movie, which is actually a movie, came out. <br /> <br /> This film tells all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they must work together to get anywhere. The cultural clash shows how different the world is and how differently we perceive ourselves until someone arrives and gives us an alarm. I highly recommend this film to anyone in business or just wanting a laugh, because yes it's fun. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it! Greetings
