I have to rate this 10 out of 10 on the rare occasion that happens to see this review, take pity on me, take me to Hollywood and involve me in his strange and funny world. But in all seriousness, it was nice. The first episode is obviously finding its feet, but it has that strangeness of Silverman running through it. It is not a high-comedy laugh, but it is a good thing, there is too much to laugh about, and this would not be right with ideas when to laugh, it is for the public to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdity of all this. I can easily see this as the bizarre show of Drew Carey with his strange characters and his incredibly strong central character. It is worth looking at, we are waiting for the following episodes. A good chance from the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
