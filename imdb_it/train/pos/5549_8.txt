The silent film that the Pride of the Clan starring Mary Pickford should have been set in an imaginary island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the outdoor shots were shot in Marblehead Massachusett in Marblehead Neck, near several geographically rocky sea areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) Marblehead's film location in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a substitute for Mary Pickford during filming for several scenes including the "cliff scene". Both women were small (5 ') in stature and both my father and my grandmother reported that she was a camera-backed replacement for the cliff scene as part of Chiefton's movie set. I just wanted to tell this story for future historians and movie fans. The film itself (my copy of DVD is rather poor) is very well done with a lot of action and expressive acting, including several scenes in which Miss Pickford plays a strong characterization of the woman. I liked it and would like to have a better copy of it even though I'm not sure it exists as I have seen in various movie sites that the remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. A very nice silent film with lots of action!
