So I consider myself pretty big in the anime scene, with very few shows I simply DON'T LOOK. <br /> <br /> this show, however, I would recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Most likely the most original series to date, it has almost everything I could ask for. A story on the sidelines, so to speak, of an unconditional love that will NOT be allowed to participate, a very shameless comedy and a cast of actors (very Japanese and American) very well put together. <br /> <br /> If not for the terribly funny look, it would be, just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I've noticed, a 'love or hate', very few people I've seen introduced to this series will end up with a disgust for this. <br /> <br /> Original in the center, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet the house on this series. I am ready to assure you that you will like it.
