I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic films, but I felt it was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Astounding. Brilliant, sweet, fun and full of heart. Chemistry is impeccable as is writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together that you really think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> Movies capture you right away and don't let you go. You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. Even the small moments melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has risen to the ranks of one of my favorite favorites ever. A masterpiece.
