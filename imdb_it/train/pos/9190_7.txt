With Tony seriously injured in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman who attends a business convention, while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the great man. The dream sequences came from an old episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, while Tony finds himself transformed into an average Joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and confused identities while on a business trip to another country. His intonation of blazers and khaki wearing schnook is more mid-american and less that of an Italian thug of Noo Joisey. A nice touch. The incredible AJ (long-haired, long-haired hippy-dippy, who at one point calls Paulie "Van Helsing") has a beautiful scene with his old comatose. The best time is that the big boys try to talk about life without Tony, who immediately breaks into a territorial dispute. Vito makes a joke about the newly dead Gene that may have been a closet case, which is interesting in light of what we're about to learn about Vito.
