I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner and this movie explores some of the death metal of the 80s and 80s that I like to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, however, the essential stupidity of the noir film protagonist is not taken out well by the female protagonist and her hero is almost a Neanderthal, hence the kitch warning.
