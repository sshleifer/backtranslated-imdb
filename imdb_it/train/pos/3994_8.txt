I went to this film only because I was dragged there and I would leave immediately because the audience was mainly composed of old people and I felt out of place. However, the film was absolutely fascinating and far from being directed towards older people. The characters were all very real and credible and I found myself discussing the film, the characters and the plot for hours afterwards. There are some pretty compelling scenes, but they are necessary and help you understand the situation better. All in all, this is a great and valuable film, a little out of the mainstream, but that doesn't mean that this film can't be appreciated by people who prefer the mainstream. It's an exciting and interesting cinematic experience.
