Most films, or set in New Orleans, turn out to be ridiculous and ridiculously inaccurate (example: remember "The Savage Bees"?) I will make an exception for "Tightrope", which has almost been right). <br /> <br /> Here is one that does not inevitably fail. The accents are not so bad (yes, the "yat" accent here is much more bourgeois than southern), the city of 1950 is shown as is / was, without the obligatory "tourist" shots, and they understand drama well without trying to make everyone "an eccentric south". <br /> <br /> One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good movie to boot ..
