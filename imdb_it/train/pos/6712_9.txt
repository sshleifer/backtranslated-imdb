I love Sabrina! It's one of my favorite programs !! My favorite episodes are; the one in which he turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes weren't as good as those in high school, but they were better than the last series which was horrible. Valerie was a good character because she was rounder than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were incredible and there seemed to be no explanation as to where they had gone! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they weren't as good as his other friends.
