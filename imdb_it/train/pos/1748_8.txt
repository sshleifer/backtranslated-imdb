From the beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is probably the most fun I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm in September. <br /> <br /> Each element came together in this film so well. It is not often that you see a film with so many jokes from the gay, the penis and the race that is so highly praised by the critics. Carell and the rest of the cast sensually distribute every vulgar joke. Carell stays sweet throughout the entire movie where at the end of the movie you're cheering him on to succeed in his relationship more than you can do for him. The supporting cast is brutal, each of them has some problems with the women themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes that are given to us. This is what makes a movie easy to remember with affection. This film will often be reported when the words "chest waxing" and "condoms" are mentioned in a conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching him in the theater I was surprised how many old people were there to watch him. I saw a group of four women from the mid-60s enter. Despite an older audience, this film still filled the entire theater with laughter. <br /> <br /> I think the kind of people who will like both the office fan and Steve Carell. Many lines remind me of the kind of jokes you would see on Family Guy. The film is superficial enough for teenage boys and still quite sweet and intelligent for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie unless you are a fan of vulgarity or if you are easily offended. However, when you're at the film, remember that this movie is all in a good mood. The jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And they're fun.
