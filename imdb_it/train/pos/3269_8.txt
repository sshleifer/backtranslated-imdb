CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after learning that she is pregnant. We then see her husband in heaven, letting the powers know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him. He is told that he can return to earth but not as himself. Flashforward 19 years in which we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and meet a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) who, apparently, is the reincarnation of his father. The film is a bit predictable ... the story goes in all the places you expect, but it's so charming played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can't help but get the fun involved. Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen for the best advantage and she and Downey are supported by a group of talented lead actors in secondary roles. An enchanting and fascinating fantasy that will wrap and enchant you.
