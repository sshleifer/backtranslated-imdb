Before watching this TV movie I didn't know much about one of my favorite actresses. After seeing it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life was. He also had wonderful moments, but I didn't realize how sad he was. This film was very beautiful and told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball very well. I highly recommend it.
