Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this fantastic film for over 15 years. Slaughter High, man! Hells yes! <br /> <br /> I won't bore you with a summary of the plot, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what happens. That's why you're here anyway. What I will do, however, is to explain the affectionate memory I have of this thorny 80s D-Movie joint. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my father used to rent all these horror films. Would he care if his children were watching them with him? No. So at that young age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie left me great. I haven't seen him since, but I still remember most of the ridiculous killings in the film. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) Is electrocuted. Or the boy is drowned in a labor reserve. Come on! My favorite, though ... the stomach that explodes from the contaminated beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? So his stomach explodes? What!? And that big line: let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic disgust to the end. <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back now, almost 20 years later, and they laugh at it. But when I was 7, I was scared. That jester hat (or was it a mask?) That the killer drove me crazy all the time! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a lousy movie. But for reasons of nostalgia and humor, this film gets a 9 out of 10 from me. Stay up late every night and hope to see him in the same Late Late Late show, or hunt down a VHS copy and dust off the VCR.
