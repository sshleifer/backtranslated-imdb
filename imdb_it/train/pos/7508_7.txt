Great acting by Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biographical films to hit the screen in a while. While covering most of Bettie's young life, she also manages to stay on a mostly focused path, which is something that most biographical films seem to lack. There is an adorable and alarming subtext in dialogue and acting. This film is an excellent break from "American Psycho" Dir, and I think this will show how his best work to date. Oh, and as a photography enthusiast, I give this film 100% in the cinema department. It was amazing how they came up with a 1950s look with modern film stocks. Awards to the D.O.P. All very pleasant. I recommend anyone interested in seeing it: 8/10.
