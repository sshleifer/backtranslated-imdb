I will come clean. The only reason I discovered this DVD is because Dominic Monaghan is a favorite of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not so good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading the few reviews around this short, I was really excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, a sleepless who is often tormented by conditions that make him doubt what is reality and what is in his head. I don't want to reveal what happens, but I'll tell you that the film can sometimes scare you into its realism. <br /> <br /> The direction is fantastic, focusing on what is essential for the story without allowing it to miss any moment of entertainment or stimulation. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this fantastic 9 out of 10 movie, to go far beyond what I thought could reach any other short film.
