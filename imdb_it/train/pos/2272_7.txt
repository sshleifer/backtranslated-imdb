Nick Nolte offers an excellent performance in the fairy tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent who worked in propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lived anonymously until the competing factions wanted to dig into the past. As with much of Vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and on those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - self-confident and confident like young Campbell, and then broken and persecuted as the oldest man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)
