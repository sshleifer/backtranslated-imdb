I love all the films of Michael Landon Jr. And the cast of Michael Landon Jr of Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not be better. Dale Midkiff has the manners to bring out this character. <br /> <br /> This film has left me spellbound from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of the Missie & Willies girl with the Clarks days the visit was only God's time. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them do so was that of love a father. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 films before this [Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I feel you can see this movie and understand it easily. Yet leave and I want to see the 3 previous films because of the story that all the characters have behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I look forward to more films from him in the future.
