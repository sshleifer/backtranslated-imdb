I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of everyone's negative reviews. I thought: even if I don't read the books, this doesn't look like the Nancy Drew I heard about. But I was wrong. Of course, it wasn't a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become a big entertainment screen. The plot was pleasant and electrifying with many fears and I thought that Emma Roberts was really credible in her way of portraying this classic character. There have been several funny moments and unlike many of the statements, at no point in this film is Nancy going out like a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing that this film did well was to balance it all with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and moments of heart. I loved this movie. What a movie, what a movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see it, be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was going crazy! Go see it or get your ass and let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made. I love it, I want to own this movie! I also love Emma Roberts. It's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, I love it.
