Tip number one - read the title as "The time of the mad dog" or perhaps the dogs. This is a beautiful ensemble piece (watch the cast and rent it out - you know you're already curious), and the director at the first meeting Bishop gives them the chance, taking time, allowing the characters to interact and chew the landscape while they wait - not with enthusiasm - for the return of "the great leader" and whatever revenge is. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight is seeing Christopher Jones after his self-imposed exile from the movies; remains a dominant film presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, this is the "Wild in the Streets" reunion party!
