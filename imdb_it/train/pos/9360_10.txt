Let me begin by saying that at the young age of 34 I was suddenly a widower. I was devastated because he wasn't sick --- he died unexpectedly of almost a coronary - his carotids exploded ... he died behind our house. There has been much speculation by the police, because he fell on something and hit the head. I was a murder suspect until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children have been as traumatized as I am, so in love with a good father figure like him. I had three young children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years my in-laws attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually, asking me not to grieve in front of the children, and to wear masks and show people what they wanted to see, not show them my pain during the holidays ... Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit outside a vacation, except of course, the pain therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul . My in-laws didn't understand it! ALWAYS changed my relationship with them, and I never came back for a vacation. This is just an example of how my pain was not respected! My (new) husband saw me falling apart talking about the trauma when I shared my soul. Collapse, I can't breathe, I'm hyperventilated and I generally feel dead for a few days if I even try to transmit the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now on this film ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul has been agitated, my heart broken. My fears and my pain have re-emerged from the real demons that this film presents; how it hurts compared to how others expect us and the inner demons too. Adam Sandler has perfectly interpreted the horrible agony he faces, surpasses and, above all, passes through your time! This film has drained all the pain I felt over the years to treat. You see, when something hurts your soul so deeply, so deep that expressions are all that comes from your mouth in moments of thought, you can't face it without wishing to be dead and walking through life, in a dead state. <br /> <br /> The bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26 to which I clung, that when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, that the Holy Spirit of God brings that agony to God's feet - - I don't need to talk. Sandler portrayed him perfectly! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which he was dragged into an audition, for mental health purposes, and returns to confront his in-laws --- (familiar to me) --- and tells them the incredible truths that he was possessed by, for SE, that he cannot overcome. It is a profoundly strong and powerful performance. I started crying and had a hard time after the pupils got up to leave the theater feeling my legs too weak to do it. My son was with me and he saw it firsthand, my movements precise as I tried to hold it together; a lesson for him, my youngest who barely remembers his dad. It has been 13 years for me, but this film brought me back to losing my in-laws forever when they asked for a mask to my emotions and my surrender to their desires, instead of respect to mine. <br /> <br /> I write this so that if you are a griever, you are prepared for this film, but I highly recommend it in the 1000-star performances that Sandler has given. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a griever, please take a lesson from his film and listen and accept people's choices in their pain, letting them find peace in their free time! Sometimes, the soul cannot pronounce words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go see this film with the fabrics and not without preparing yourself to take it inside ... to your soul!
