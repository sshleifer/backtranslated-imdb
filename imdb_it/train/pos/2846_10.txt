I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago ... And I want to thank the people who worked on creating this movie! Not the best or the most .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I'd like to figure it out for myself ... it's easy and accessible. It's a film that makes you feel good after a bad day with no regrets about the lost time watching it! It's about love and care, about the life we ​​have but sometimes we miss it because of material material ....... Look at all the time we have but we miss it. ... why do we do a fu * k ??? We must live as if we were dying ... we take care of every second and we remember: if we do good things - good things come back to us! Joy is real ... and has a special flavor in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
