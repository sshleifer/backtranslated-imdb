The story: On the island Texel, the photographer Bob, who does a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. His free spirit and his will to live intrigue Bob, who has had a very traumatic experience just before. His life is not as simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob entangles himself in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win her trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this film is very natural and the plot takes place in a pleasant way even if it remains a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character were "psychology" a little 'more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives the film depth and something to think about in my opinion. History never reaches an emotional climax, even if the characters pass enough to justify it. So you don't know the characters at that deeper level. The actors offer a good job and they play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but I think it would be suitable for the film if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, since the naivety of this character doesn't work for an adult. on woman. Camera work is nice, and there are some great shots of nature on the island. I give the movie at 7/10.
