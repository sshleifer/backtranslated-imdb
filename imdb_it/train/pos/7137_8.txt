The plot of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper makes us seem like there is a big dose of maudlin, a sickly feeling. But the talented director Jack Gold is an expert in touching emotions in the right way, and instead emerges as a compelling, moving wartime drama with excellent productions and leading performances. One of the best, if not the best TV movies of the 90s that perhaps would have been even more successful if it had been released in theaters. <br /> <br /> The evacuation of children in rural cities and villages in World War II was obviously a common practice, but in the case of the young boy here it was doubly important due to a squalid home life in the capital of the Kingdom Kingdom. The horrors of war on the front of the house is however not overlooked, and the construction of the film until its tangle of throat and its hazy gaze leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what happened before. It is almost (but not quite) worthy of comparison with the final at IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946). All in all, a modern classic.
