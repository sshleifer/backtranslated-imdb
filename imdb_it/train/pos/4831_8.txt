I went into this expecting not to like myself; I thought it would be terribly worthy and serious, and rather tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> Actually it's much better than that, and I found myself really amused. I don't know much about Queen Victoria, beyond what she knows best, married to Albert, who died young, and cried forever. Seeing the circumstances in which she grew up was fascinating; in fact I found myself wishing I had seen more of the story, and I imagine we could see a sequel at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually the film is amazing. The sets and costumes are incredibly sumptuous without being too flashy and over the top. Acting is top notch for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> In a word, it was great!
