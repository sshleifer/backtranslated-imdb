The Russian emigrated director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) is launching his epic on the Russian revolution, and hires an old former general from the Tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to interpret the film's general, and the two relive the drama and memory of the woman who shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years old. <br /> <br /> As much as I can prove, I feel difficult to warm up "The last command" for all its virtues. 'The Docks of New York' was undoubtedly a great film, and 'Underworld' is a film I've always longed to see, but 'The Last Command' is pretty heavy. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really makes the script come to life, except in the sequences set in Hollywood, which describe the number of employable workers and the machinations of a large film production with the most advanced technology. <Emil Jannings is, predictably, a wonderful Russian general, who marvelously distinguishes between the old traumatized and decrepit ex-general, pierced by his unhappiness, and the vigorous, vigorous officer of the past. <br /> <br /> The finish is great and worth the wait, but to get there you have to be prepared to be a little bored sometimes.
