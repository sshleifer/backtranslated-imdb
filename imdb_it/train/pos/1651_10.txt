I saw the presentation of this on PBS in the United States when it was originally broadcast in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries were available on DVD, last year I bought the first editions of all three books. Since then I have searched the series on movie sites on the Internet. Today I found this website. I will give up the search. <br /> <br /> I too would like to purchase this complete miniseries - 26 episodes -. After buying the DVDs, I read every book, so I watched the episodes of that book. This is what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas Rangers trilogy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or series of books that have become excellent television miniseries - or movie series - what time is available on DVD?
