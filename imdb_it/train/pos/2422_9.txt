Yes, it's a low budget. Yes, it's one of the first Candy movies, but maybe it's his most fun! John Candy was not so far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and shows. If you don't break up when Candy tries to help a guy with his grocery while being handcuffed to a cohort escaped in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with just the apartment door that separates them (eh?, Watch the movie! ), or the way Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) is talking to his mother on the phone, or simply the countless number of facial expressions that only Candy could offer you, better check your pulse! If you like John Candy from "Only the Lonely" this may not be a movie I would recommend you see, but if you like the SCTV days of John Candy, this movie is a must see!
