This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she does not ask permission and she does not apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robotic dinosaurs, flying machines and a team of male cheerleaders who steal wallets. The star of the show is not a hero, he is a spoiled and bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offensive humor that it offers, the show probably isn't for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comic style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee ("Stay" by Bobcat Goldthwait) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack , Monster House). It also shows the best talents of the thriving online community, channel101.com. (If you participate in this show, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" on March 1st, it will draw from the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Watch the Sarah Silverman show. This kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
