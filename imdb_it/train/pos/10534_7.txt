Whether it's a good movie or not, films of this kind must be made, I think. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees", a crushing and mysterious film with Isabelle Huppert sodomized by a young American in a mud pond, in a cheerful sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope the director goes beyond the border, as if I felt that the choices made by Vincenzo Natali were not always subtle (some scenes were unfortunately "tarte-à-la-crème", like a childish farce), talking about screenwriting and cinematography? ? The color of "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprisingly, compared to previous Natali films.
