Despite being an impressionable young man when I first experimented with the Gundam Wing series, reviewing the series, I reaffirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, the character design and the depth of the character are masterfully executed. While at first sight it appears as a kind of group of boys, the elegant attractiveness of the characters can partly be attributed to a great art, with individual personalities that create clear and captivating distinctions between the characters. As a result, it is extremely easy to become attracted to a particular character. Personally, I liked Heero for his stoic personality. While I may be influenced by a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we achieve peace?) By providing action-packed battles in robotic clothes large, which, to say the least, is excellent.
