I was about 7 when I first saw this film. It wasn't that special, but a few years later I saw it again and that time it was fun, very :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language and also the "special effects". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, don't wait for a Hollywood hit, this movie was also made from ca. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy. Also the film and video version (But I don't think it was ever shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Look, have fun !!! Yeti forever !!!
