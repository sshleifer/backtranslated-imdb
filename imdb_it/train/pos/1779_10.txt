I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It's damn good! I'm not a big fan of movies but I have to tell you that this opened my eyes. Stunning color and fast energy. I was lucky enough to see him in a screening during the Zoinks! Film Festival in Boston, and the story really shrouded me from the beginning. He had a lot of themes and characters for adults and when I finished I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. It would be fun. My only problem is Melissa Connor's performance as Anya. UGH! SUCKS! I saw a block of wood pull out a better performance. I don't know what the director was thinking when he chose it. But if you ignore it you can't help but give this movie a great ten !!!
