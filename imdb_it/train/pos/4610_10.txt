On a winter's day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds rent a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, it sounds interesting", "who is this Jackie Chan?", "He never heard of him". Two hours later, after seeing the film, in a state of daze, we wanted to learn more. 16 years later (and definitely out of pocket from JC's movie collection!) The film still grabs me like no other. Ok, maybe I have a weakness for this as it was my "first" (Cannonball Run does not count !!) film JC, but it is an excellent film. It has all the classic elements JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say it is dated, it was made in 1985, obviously it's dated! But then also Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without films like Police Story where would the Hollywood action be today? PS sets standards, many scenes were stolen to be used in other films. To really appreciate it you need to see it in widescreen, otherwise you miss so much of the movie (yes, it really falls from the bus that goes around the corner!). If you have not already done so, WATCH THIS FILM NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
