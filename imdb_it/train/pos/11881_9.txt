Every great gangster movie has undercurrents of human dramas. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from "Scarface". This is a story of fierce greed, corruption and power. The dark side of the fabulous "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about the "kindness" of this film did not understand the point. The superficial characters, poor music and outdated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the life of these characters really counts, at least on a human level. In fact the film practically marks the satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers who have been positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, he is occasionally excellent and well-run (especially the memorable ending), but he often sinks into messy and misguided. Fortunately, he is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably a good therapy for him, considering the habit of coke he was facing at the time). The themes are consistent, focusing primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. Dialogue is also excellent, in which humor and drama are easily seen. There are many prominent lines that have since turned into popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast helps make it what it is, but this is really the Pacino movie. One of his previous less subtle performances (something much more common to him nowadays), this is a world completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet it is here as still as watchable, in a very funny (and intentionally exaggerated) form. It's hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this movie, perhaps in one of the most imitated performances ever. Pfeiffer showed himself to be boring and uncomfortable at first sight, but I understood how he plays the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly judged. Supporting players are also very good, especially Paul Shenar like the gentle Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes funny, sometimes shocking and constantly controversial. "Scarface" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that means for you). An essential and accessible gangster film and a reference point for pop culture. 9/10
