This was just another wonderful film from the Berlin Festival. But unlike "Yes", by Sally Potter, whom I had seen a few days before, where after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire to embrace the whole world and I was just happy to be alive, this time the opposite happened: there was something dragging me down, and the air suddenly seemed cold and hard to breathe. It was as if suddenly nothing was left, all hope, the whole future had been taken away to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed to be mournful and closed, but then, a beautiful day, that kind of brightness appears that opens the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. There was no one by his side but suddenly he found a mate, just out of nowhere, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of his life. That person was Toni, a vagabond girl who doesn't seem to have roots, just like her. <br /> <br /> But the title of the film is "Ghosts", and the ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, is there no way to keep them? Ghosts also represent people's hidden fantasies, the strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself, which are hidden from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts. Once she lost her baby daughter in Berlin, which apparently was robbed in a supermarket, in a single moment of carelessness. Now the time has passed, and Françoise is back in Berlin, still looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina could be that child, after all she has the same scar on her ankle and the heart-shaped desire between her shoulder blades that seems to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina adopts this idea, after all not only does she desperately need a companion, but also wants a mother. But in the end she is empty-handed, Toni has disappeared with a man, and her alleged mother turns out to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes Françoise's husband, and the statement could not be more disenchanting. Nina is only a "niña", a girl without a name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. There is no Marie in this world to accompany our solitary lives. So, in the end, we see Nina all alone, about to walk the road that opened before her, in a future that seems to be without joy and uncertain.
