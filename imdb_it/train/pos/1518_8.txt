THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, this would make eight films. Although, that film is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> I observe Amicus' anthologies with great memories as I loved them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them today are just as strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to track down this movie. The synopses of the stories were so tempting that I went so far as to pay a considerable sum when I found a copy. As fantastic as the film is, I felt a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It wasn't as good as I was led to believe. Although better than his two predecessors, he is nowhere near as good as his four successors as I will demonstrate. <br /> <br /> The connecting story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old House. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants. The linking story later sees him visit the real estate agent who sold the house. Although this linking story seems tempting on paper, in practice it is flat and lifeless and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I couldn't help but think that John Bennett is the version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry of a poor man. I would have preferred to see one of the two actors mentioned above in his role. We could have both here - one as a police inspector and another as a real estate agent. They could, and I believe, revive this weak element of the film. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each of which focuses on one inhabitant of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of criminal stories. He is absorbed by an exciting story about a strangler, even going so far as to draw a sketch to help his writing. Shortly thereafter, he begins to see visions of his own creation. Some excellent direction by Peter Duffell, in particular with the choice of camera angles, helps to belittle the screenplay contained. Elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and also helps to elevate the story. The story ends with a semi-twist, but I couldn't help but have the sense of a script that didn't allow it to live up to its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story sees Peter Cushing enter the House. He is a lonely man who is still struggling for a beautiful young woman who once abandoned him and keeps a picture of him. Cushing's performance actually brings this exciting story. He is helped by the director who chooses to focus constantly on Cushing's loneliness. This is carried on with a great hallucination scene that helps us see in Cushing's mind. However, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that looks like his girlfriend. Of course his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing turn in the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and easily the best sees Christopher Lee - my favorite horror actor of all time - enter the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee offers his perfect frozen performances here. He shows no love or care for his daughter at all. He even brings a school housekeeper to educate her. The housekeeper, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her superb performances, tries to find out what's wrong. Without giving too far, I can reveal that witchcraft has a role. Christopher Lee's presence is truly electrifying in all the scenes in which he finds himself. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her enormously underrated performance as the girl who is easily the most disturbing character in the entire film. The film is also worth seeing for the sake of seeing only this story. <br /> <br /> The final story is played almost entirely for laughter but certainly entertains and that's what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror film actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied with the approach his producers bring to films, seeing everything as cheap and false, in particular the costumes. So he decides to buy an authentic cape for his last vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a merchant who sells Pertwee an ancient cloak. When Pertwee puts on his cloak, he begins to develop fangs and basically turns into a vampire. Pertwee's performance must be seen to be believed. It's really hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much bigger. <br /> <br /> The linking story ends with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly appropriate since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house. The rest you will be able to train yourself. As weak as the history of links is, it has a decent ending, even if unintentionally comic. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the blame for failures in what should have been a truly magnificent film does not lie with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he has. I think the script was too sober and lacking the ambition that can be found in the next four films. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, despite its flaws, is a must for fans of Amicus's Anthology film, fan of other Amicus movies or fan of horror portmanteau movies. If my summary gives the film sufficient appeal in your eyes, take a look. You will like it!
