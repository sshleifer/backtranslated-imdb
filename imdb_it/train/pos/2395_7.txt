Although he had the misfortune of reaching the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this film deserves an audience. An inner look at the staging of "The Scottish Play" as the actors call "Macbeth" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a clear, efficient and elegant treatment of the betrayal that occurs to the crew. With a wonderfully evocative soundtrack, and with a much better appearance and sound than its small budget would suggest, this is a silent gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.
