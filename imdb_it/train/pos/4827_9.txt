And that's why historical / biographical films are so important to all of us, moreover, when they are so well done, like this one! <br /> <br /> Before seeing "The Young Victoria", I knew something about Queen Victoria, but in the end I had a lot more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as BIG as Victoria (who would guess it!) and will probably be nominated for an Oscar this year. Personally, I support her ... <br /> <br /> For technical reasons, I am pleased to say that it is a very successful production, with a wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and, of course, as if it should be, a fantastic Periodic Costume Design! <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but above all, incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
