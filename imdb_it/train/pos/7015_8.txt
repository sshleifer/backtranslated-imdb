Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically leaves the store to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS Agent is this? <br /> <br /> Many of us have all heard the line from an IRS agent, "Hi, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help you." Our smile then spreads in a chuckle that says "Yes, right". <br /> <br /> As you get closer to this story, you can't understand it. It is easy with those that are checked. What is your reason? Is it from another planet, an angel, a rich boy who wants to do good? He helps us so much that we want him to be our auditor if we were to be controlled, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (joking, I'm kidding) <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is perfect and so much that the clues were ignored that would tell me what was really going on. Intense, I repeat intense, the focus was on Ben and remains there. The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure it out and I haven't seen any clues (what clues are you talking about, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the best way to go here. At the end of the film I finally put it all together. Well, it was obvious since then. And yes, it's exaggerated, but it's still a good story, especially because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's exaggerated and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers, you have to understand that the message of the movie is completely wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you won't need too many clues to figure it out. I didn't do it <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Gender: Yes, but nothing to be excited about. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No.
