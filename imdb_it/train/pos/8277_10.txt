A disturbing piece that the passionate horror movie fan will fall with gratitude. Keep your Freddys and your Jasons: this movie is in the same company as "The Haunting" (the original). Lyrical and sincere, he stays with you all night, just like those terrifying CBS Radio Mystery Theater shows. A smart rent.
