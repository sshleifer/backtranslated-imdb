To all those who think 1. This was a boring telecan 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> SHUT THE F ** k UP !! This was one of the Academy's best prizes because 1. It was a moment in history to have a black yes. "Black actress" won an academic award for best actress, so many of our black sisters were ignored by the academy for many years. To be honest, I stopped watching the Academy awards because of the lack of diversity in both winners or candidates. For me it was nothing more than a group of whites caressing each other in the back. The academy had many chances to vote black actresses who were brilliant in the films, such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but it was not so 2.Halle berries deserved that Oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her for so long that deserving actresses have been ignored academy the majority of which are white voters yes yes Nicole kidman sang very nicely in muling rouge! but it was time for black people to be hosted in these awards. As for Mr. Washington, the academy owed him long after that unjust loss to MalcomX. For all those who think that the race is not a problem "probably the whites" in the film industry, well, there are many of the most talented black actresses who have been reduced to the typical stereo of the roles of whites of what they think is a woman black or does not exist "Angela basset". I don't expect many of the whites to understand any of this because they never had to deal with it. Some think they are the ones who inflicted it
