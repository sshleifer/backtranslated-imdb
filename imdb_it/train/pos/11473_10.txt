Zero Day is a film that few people have seen, and what a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the two main characters descend on the room and kill people mercilessly, then they commit suicide and made my stomach hurt. I was trembling, that's how strong this film is. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic. It's too incredible not to have a perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It's not a budget that makes a film good, it's the amount of feeling that producers put into it that makes it good. <br /> <br /> Leave a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can't get out. It makes you understand the real horror of the shootings - especially if you had to meet that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to look at it. I'm fourteen and I think this film is simply too good to be put into words. Looks like you're looking at something that actually happened.
