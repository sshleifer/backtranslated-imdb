I've been waiting for an image as original as this for a while now. The Brokedown palace has that `difficult to believe 'aspect, but with the brilliant direction and the script, the palace marks big. <br /> <br /> I never liked watching Claire Danes in any of her films, but I'll tell you something, she really changed her mind with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on holiday in Thailand where he meets a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, he neglected to inform them that they would carry an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, they are eventually captured and end up in a prison in Thailand. I know, I know, how can you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can overcome that one mistake, you will find a well written and recited story. Lately I've found myself attracted to the plots of the films I watch and develop a personal feeling for the characters I watch. This film is no different. At the end of the film I found myself more attentive to her than all the other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman offers excellent performance and combines the film beautifully. <br /> <br /> There are some twists that, at the end of the film, will make you cry. This is one of those movies that you probably spent while searching for that movie to watch at home. It is my opinion that the next time you go out to the video store you will not step back.
