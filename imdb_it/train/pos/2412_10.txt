I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best series of scripts and scripts to come on any network for a long time. This show had great potential and I couldn't wait to see it every week. This could be developed into a large Primetime soap. People eagerly await this type of acting while we are "Reality TV". I crave the kind of writing and acting that presents itself as Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove has updated this concept quite well and I anticipated that it is improving. There is so much to expand with these characters and they have all been very interesting and fully captivating. It would be a loss not to explore this and develop these characters after attracting and hooking them into their world. I loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without exaggerating or offending. I love.
