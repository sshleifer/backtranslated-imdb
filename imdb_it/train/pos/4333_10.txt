seen this in preview - great film - wonderful characterizations - witty and intelligent dialogue - the actors were fantastic - Peter Falk is a candidate for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was fascinating - the photography was wonderful Reiser was at the theater when we saw the film, and he gave a vivid account of the making of the film - it was his long dream to write a semi-autobiographical account of the relationships between children and fathers, and more specifically between him and his father - this was achieved in a dramatic and amusing fashion - the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a family feeling - I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see intelligent dramas and wonderful shows
