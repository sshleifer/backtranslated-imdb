Quick and easy, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As others have already mentioned, I too am not from the south, I don't really care for country music and I've never worn a cowboy hat. (I've never driven in a car with a corpse in the trunk, but I love "Goodfellas".) This is just a fantastic movie. Shooting in 2.35 format and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story set in Texas, with great shows. Travolta is fantastic. Next to "Pulp Fiction", it is the best thing he has done. It was in my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Take a look at this !!! It's a 10 !!!!
