Ashanti is a kind of movie from the 70s (to be precise). It reminded me of the Wild Geese in a sense (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission to Africa). It is also a very beautiful film, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are studying, one day they are kidnapped by slavers who work for an Arab slave trader called Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov, of all). The rest of the film is David trying to get it back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and ready to do anything to get his wife back, but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff. He is helped first by an Englishman who fights against the slave trade that no one admits (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then by an Arab named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has an account to settle with Suleiman (he is very intense for everything, a very engaging character), and so he rides with David to find him and get Anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene where David fails miserably to get on his camel. <br /> <br /> Then there's a lot of adventure. There is also a lot of questions about morality. The progress of the story is a bit predictable from this point, and there are some freedoms taken with the plot to move things faster, but it's all quite forgivable. The question is: will David arrive in Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is in it!)?
