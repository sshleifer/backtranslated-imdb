Those who remember only the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional storyteller would do well to look for this fascinating piece of satire from the 1960s. Ustinov interprets as a convicted embezzled (we see him for the first time on his last day of imprisonment where he is preparing the income statement of the prison governor) who, warning that the future is in computers, poses (through an able identity theft) as a computer expert and aims to infiltrate an American multinational. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who co-wrote the screenplay) is in top form, as is the delightful Maggie Smith, here strangely thrown like an accident-prone cockney -sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also performed a fun performance as a suspicious executive who drew on Maggie Smith. Moreover, Karl Malden is satisfactorily clumsy as Ustinov and Newhart's feminising leader. <br /> <br /> What do I particularly like about this movie? Not only is it a well-designed movie caper, but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumble in love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective). <br /> <br /> So what's not to love? Well, the script is no more computerized than most films (that is to say, almost for nothing) even if it captures the atmosphere of the late 1960s of the 'big iron' quite well. Also there are a couple of small plot anomalies that you probably won't notice until the second or third view, but I think these are minor flaws. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie that is worth looking for, and once you've seen it once you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
