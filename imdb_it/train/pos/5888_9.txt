I was able to see this film in its entirety and was deeply moved by it. I wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked wonderful - our image of 60-year-old women certainly changed from Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback of this film was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the 70s shows "MTM" or "Rhoda". I would have thought that since it was set in New York City (where "Rhoda" had been set) at least some mention would have been made of his sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would have appeared, assuming of course that she was still in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the ABC will make this series and will bring back to the appearance of the guests all the old casts of these shows. By the way, what was wrong with CBS doing this meeting, or a final series? Isn't that the network that carried "MTM" and "Rhoda" shows?
