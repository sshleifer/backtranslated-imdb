The castle of Man is located in one of those settlements built on vacant land and land that in those days were called "Hoovervilles", from the name of our unfortunate thirty-first president who was stuck with the Great Depression in his administration. The proposition of this film is that a man's house is still his castle even when it is only a shack in a Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a shack and the truth is told to this guy even in the good times it wouldn't work so much. But in a very typical part of Tracy before being chosen as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of a slew of classic roles, she is playing a tenacious and tender cup that plays Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women and men. Women had put some additional strains, if men had difficulty finding work, women made it last twice as long. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution for just one square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who faces this kind of problems and makes no requests to her in her castle. Soon they fell in love, even though Tracy is not the type to fix. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had something extra to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid story during the making of Man's Castello. And both were Catholics and married and in those days it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith very seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast Walter Connolly is a sort of father figure for the whole field, Marjorie Rambeau who went through all the pitfalls that Young could meet and try to direct it and Arthur Hohl, a really disgusting asshole who also keeps an eye on Young. Hohl brings the Man's Castle plot to its peak through his intrigues. <br /> <br /> The Castle of Man is an observation of the Great Depression, not the usual stuff to evade movies for those who try to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.
