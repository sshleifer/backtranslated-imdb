It helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and the time frame in which this film takes place. First of all, these women are NOT geishas, ​​they are oiran (prostitutes) in the "green houses" of the Yoshiwara type, about 1860, to give or to do .. This should help to clarify some details that could confuse the unaware. The film addresses issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps more importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and those of others in their immediate environment. This, in addition to the scandalous photography and the incredibly beautiful music, make a nice ride. Just connect it, suspend disbelief and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
