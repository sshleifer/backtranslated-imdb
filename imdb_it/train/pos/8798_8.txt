First of all, I will not praise IÃ±arritu's short film, even though I'm Mexican and proud of its success in the Hollywood mainstream. <br /> <br /> In another hand, I see that most reviews focus on their favorite movies (and not so); but we are forgetting that there is a thin bottom line surrounding the entire compilation, and perhaps it will not be so pleasant for Americans. (Although that was not the main purpose of the producers) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most of the short films don't show the suffering that the WASP people went through because the September 11 terrorist attack , but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I'm saying? Look, in the short film of Bosnia, the message is: "You cry because of the people who died in the Towers, but we (The Others = Eastern Europeans) have been crying for a long time for the crimes committed against our women and no one pays attention to us as the whole world has made you ". <br /> <br /> Although the story of Burkina Fasso is more comedy, there is the same thought: "You are angry because Osama bin Laden has hit you in a bad way, but we (The Others = Africans) should to be more angry, because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS a long time ago, and nobody pays attention to how the whole world has done to you ". <br /> <br /> Look now at the brief Sean Penn: The fall of the Twin Towers makes a lonely (and alienated) man happy. So the message is that Power and Greed (symbolized by the Towers) must fall to allow people to see the sun rise and flowers bloom? It is extraordinary that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is almost subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, the Ken Loach (very well known because its anti-capitalist ideology) is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by forces of the evil, but we (The Others = Latin American) have suffered in a similar date something worse, and nobody remembers our pain as the whole world has done to you ". <br /> <br /> It is as if the creativity of this project wanted to tell the Americans: "See now, America? You are not the only one who has become a victim of world violence, you are not alone in your pain and, by the way , we (the Others = the non-Americans) have suffered much more than you for a long time ago, so we are sympathetic to you in your pain ... and, by the way, we are sorry because you had a taste of your own medicine "Only the Mexican and French courts have shown compassion and sympathy for the American people; the others are like a slap in the face for the US state, which is not the same as the Americans.
