This film is simply wonderful! It has everything: laughter, pain, beauty, poetry, truth. All in a simple but intense story - like life! Don't distract yourself for a second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone tells Hollywood that you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories out there.
