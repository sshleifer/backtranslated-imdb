**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as to sacrifice their best friends and family and not realize what monsters are doing by doing so. Until, as in the case of Gypo Noland as a bull, Victor Mclaglen, it is too late. <br /> <br /> It is 1922 and the pinnacle of the Irish revolt Black & Tan against the powerful British Empire with the Tans, British occupying troops, in search of the wanted Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, wanted for the killing of a spirited soldier. Gypo, a good friend of the fugitive, McPhillip, is not lucky enough to have a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, forced to play tricks on Dublin's red-light district to pay her rent. /> <br /> After an indignant Gypo worked on a potential John who wants to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, an angry Katie tells the not so brilliant gyro that he is preventing her from supporting herself with the only the banking resource he has, his body. Katie also tells Gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what his desperate situation is. Telling the Gypo numb that it would cost only ten pounds to go to America and get out of the poverty of Ireland Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip who has just seen a £ 20 reward announced. That's enough money for him and Kaite to travel to America. Gypo going to a house on the Dublin flop and a canteen for a free meal is caught meeting his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells him that he slipped in Dublin to see his mother, Mrs. McPhillip and his sister Mary, Una O'Connor and Heather Angel, and if he can make sure everything is safe for him to go home and then leave for his Republican Irish unit outside the city. <br /> <br /> All the Gypos can see Frankie in the face is the reward of 20 pounds for him to be turned into police! Without thinking twice, after assuring Frankie that all is well, Gypo secretly goes to the police and informs his friend that he is shot later and killed in a police and Tan shootout in his mother's house. <br /> <br /> With the deed done the police chief delivers the £ 20 pound sterling, almost thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes it and slips out the back door of the station police so that one can see it. You can see in the face and actions of the police chief that he has nothing but total disregard for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip. Although he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the British Empire. This is how the low traitors or informers are also held by those for whom they work secretly. <br /> <br /> Gypo turns out to be his worst enemy after his betrayal of Frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind. Gypo sees and listens to everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, points a finger and involves him in the betrayal and death of Frankie by the British authorities. Gypo's guilty mind made him regally and gloriously drunk, with the reward money, when he was forced to admit his crime to his Irish colleagues in the Republican Army, who tried the Gypo almost dead and almost drunk went to his party to drink and prostitute himself. <br /> <br /> Any good feeling, if possible, that you had for the weak and robust mind, Gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation, in order not to shoot, he falsely implied an innocent man , Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime of informing his friend Frankie McPhillip. Which is quickly exposed as a total production by Gopo himself, nothing else. The color is then cast while straws are being drawn for those who would be the only ones to put a bullet in Gypo's head for the last chapter of this crucial and unforgettable Crime & Punishment classic.
