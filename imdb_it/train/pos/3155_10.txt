I would like "the spectacle of the 70s" to return to television. It was the greatest show ever !!! They should make episodes among other episodes, but of course this could be confusing. But I would like you to come back and do other episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely fun. You can't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really fun part to every episode and the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie went out together. Those were the best episodes. "That show of the '70s is the best" .... It will always be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show is over. They should make new episodes.
