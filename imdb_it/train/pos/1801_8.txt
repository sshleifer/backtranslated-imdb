I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then, and I still do it now. But what I realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a movie with a G score, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and the voice sung by Reynolds is appropriate for a landfill dog. There are some good songs ranging from the optimistic ("Let's make music together") to direct emotions ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot good, even if it plays a bribe once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. A film worth trying.
