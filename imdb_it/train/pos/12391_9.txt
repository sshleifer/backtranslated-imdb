Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful top model, who lives with lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) in her apartment. He tried to commit suicide twice in the past: the first time when he was a teenager and he saw his father betray his mother with two women in his house, and then when Michael's wife died. Since then, he has left Christ and the Catholic Church behind. Alison wants to live alone in her apartment and with the help of real state agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner), she finds a wonderful old furnished apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a reasonable rent. He sees a strange man in the window on the top floor of the building and Miss Logan informs that he is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest who lives alone supported by the Catholic Church. Alison moves into her new place and, once there, receives a visitor: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) welcomes her and introduces her new neighbors. Then, invite Alison to her cat Jezebel's birthday party in the night. The next day, strange things happen with Alison in her apartment and with her health. Alison looks for Miss Logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. A further investigation shows that all the people he knew in the group were dead criminals. Frightened by the situation, Alison embraces Christ again, while Michael investigates gruesome events. Alison understands that she is living in the doorway of hell. <br /> <br /> Although underestimated in IMDb User Rating, "The Sentinel" is one of the best horror films of all time. I saw this film at least six times, being the first time in the 70s, in the cinema. In September 7th 2002, I bought the imported DVD and saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie again. Even after so many years, this film is still fantastic. The gruesome and frightening story scares us even today. The cast is a constellation of stars and stars. You can see many actors and actresses, who have become famous at the beginning of their career. Fans of the horror film certainly adore "The Sentinel", and I'm one of them. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'A Sentinela dos Malditos' ('The Sentinel of the Damned') <br /> <br /> Obs.: On September 02, 2007, I saw this again movie.
