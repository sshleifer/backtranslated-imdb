I went to see this Finnish film and I must say that it is one of the best films I've seen this year. Intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories, all set on the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories unite very well at the end, remembering, perhaps, a bit like Tarantino's films are made. Most of the actors behaved very well, which is certainly necessary in realistic dramas of this type. I particularly enjoyed the acting of Sanna Hietala, the lead actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB has the wrong information about Sanna. His name, as you might have noticed in my review;), is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
