This is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released, and probably the most popular, is a parody of the 1926 silent film What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I looked at this and I don't understand kiddie-porn this was claimed. It's just a cute little movie. I saw family shows that I grew up watching in the 80s and 90s that little girls dressed more provocatively by acting in a 'mature' way. It was more provocative because they weren't dressed in diapers. There is nothing provocative in a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) I read that description of the film and where it is claimed only one pedophile would like to watch this. This is sick. For me, if you look at this and you are annoyed, maybe you need to look into your psyche and try to understand why it bothers you. It is an innocent film made as a parody of another film. All the films of B.B. they were parodies, nothing more. The parodies / parodies of today are graphic in nature and have real almost pornographic scenes and a rather base language. Shouldn't they be scarier? I can look at those without problems, but sometimes they take stories for children and turn them into crap in those parodies. This is what should go under the skin. Not that they did a babysitter (not a word, I know) a 1926 adult movie, because we know how those silent films were PORNOGRAPHIC, eh? Not to mention those pre-codified Hollywood-style films of the time, so vile and obscene. Would they NEVER make such a filth today? (note the sarcasm)
