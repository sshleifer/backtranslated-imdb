This film is extraordinary for raising the spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at it, I see and hear fun things I missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (foreign) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing that has ever hit the music scene today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly washed 60s-70s group that has never been good at first, due to drug use and internal fighting. One wonders what it might have been, listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruit draws inspiration from The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> Fruit member is quite memorable. Stephen Rea plays the role of Tony Costello, dead and dead, who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour, hoping to get monetary benefits. Costello approaches ex-roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him rekindle the flame of a long past. <br /> <br /> Juliet picks up the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), messing with Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot), and extravagantly glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Tumbling in is another ex-roadie, the hippy-token-jokester Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never burned the flame. <br /> <br /> While Juliet searches for the latest member of their heterogeneous band, the elusive guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by sheaf Bruce Robinson), the assembled members quarrel, just like in the old days, fighting over the rusty talent of others. <br /> <br /> The band is then given the opportunity to take a small Dutch tour, to prepare for the festival. With the young Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) of Hendrix taking Lovell's place, the crew hits the road. The sparks fly as their memories fade out, threatening to burn their unfinished goals ... <br /> <br /> Prepare to laugh, sing, cheer and cry, as these memorable characters engrave on your hearts. .
