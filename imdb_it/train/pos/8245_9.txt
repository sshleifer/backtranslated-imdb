Even without saying a word, Billy Connely is as wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mom" - even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... My father told me to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's a bit like Airplane meets (meats?) Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And don't forget my coffin head <br /> <br /> And Fido in a shirt Aloha is just great! <br /> <br /> And yes, social commentary is too much to start commenting. <br /> <br /> In short, everything really works!
