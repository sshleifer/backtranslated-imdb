Uggh! I was not impressed by this film, although I must admit that it is technically well done. It gets a 7 for very high production values, but as far as entertainment values ​​are concerned, it is rather poor. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 1950s. He won the Oscar for best film, but the film is just boring sometimes with a lot of dancing, dancing and dances. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting (like MEET ME IN ST LOUIS), this film is almost all about singing and dancing. Actually, this film is about the longest song and dance number in history and if you're not there, the film will quickly bore you. Give me more history! Consequently, with exaggerated production numbers and a weak history, this film is like a constant diet of meringue, which does not satisfy in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is the movie that beat "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for the best movie! And to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" weren't even named in this category! Even more surprising to me is that "Ace in the Hole" was lost to the best screenplay, this film's screenplay - although "An American in Paris" had almost no history to talk about and was mainly driven by dance and songs.
