"Victor doesn't have much, but that doesn't stop him from trying to hang out with Judy, the prettiest girl on the block, he just has hope and a one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family. Trust him, his brother he loves it and his half sister has just declared war, but Victor thinks that love can really win everyone in this warm, genuine and touching romantic comedy about life in the part of the city that most people never see ", according to synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett "Raising Victor Vargas" arouses engaging "debut" performances by lead actor Victor Rasuk (like Victor Vargas) and the cast. Mr. Rasuk and juicy Judy Marte (like Judy Gonzalez) are sexy and endearing as "Lower East Side Kids" who discover the joy of sexual attraction. Considering how attractive they are in this image, it is not difficult to foresee that they connect and, even if you might wonder how "innocent" they are, their characterizations seem true. <br /> <br /> Victor's brother "Nino" is played by Victor's royal brother, Silvestre Rasuk, who plays the part of the older brother. Sometimes, it's nice to see brothers of films that look exactly alike; and hopefully they will work together again. The sister "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs" Krystal Rodriguez (in the role of Vicki) and the old world Altagracia Guzman (in the role of grandmother) complete the family of Dominican immigrants hungry for sex. So, are adult training films in vogue or what? <br /> <br /> ******* Breeding of Victor Vargas (05/16/02) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, July Mars, Silvestre Rasuk
