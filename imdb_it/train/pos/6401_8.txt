Men of Honor has many important aspects. Good action sequences, many scenes of "feeling good", a good soundtrack, but the part that really makes the film is the great acting. Mostly from Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is centered on Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American diver on the open sea. Describes his hard struggle from being a poor farmer to entering the diving school and beyond. It's a good story, but it seems to have been done many times before. A person, against all odds, will not give up until they reach their goals that he established for some sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but many of the difficulties that Brashear's faces in the film are questionable include the CO. of the sub tampering school of its final test. However, this is offset by the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the film. Deniro plays the Mater Chief Sunday which is the teacher of the diving school that Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro enters, he omits this vibration of extreme arrogance that you cannot hate unless you have incredible power. Before the film ends, Deniro gives numerous speeches that will make you laugh at how beautiful he is, but you are too stunned by the way he punches them. In the end you have to doubt some aspects of the film, but admit it, if it were all true, it would make you doze your place within the first twenty minutes.
