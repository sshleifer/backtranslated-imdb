Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, writer / director of the acclaimed 2002 mini-film "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic, at 1 hour and 53 minutes, is another beautiful romantic drama in which we must face the tragedy and celebrate the beauty and joy of life. Westerners, particularly urban gays like me, need to be moved out of our security zone and be informed of real life and the struggle for death elsewhere to be able to love fairly. <br /> <br /> While "Yossi & Jagger" focused on a gay couple in the closed borders of Israeli military service, "Ha Buah" focuses on a group of civilian friends, both heterosexual and gay, who share a unity in the heart of tolerance generally tolerant to homosexuals, but not the capital, always gay-friendly, Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> "Ha Buah" opens with a dramatic checkpoint scene at the border where Noam (Ohad Knoller ?? Yossi of "Yossi & Jagger") meets for the first time the charming young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon flourishes ?? but in that political climate opportunities should be seized quickly or lost altogether. <br /> <br /> From there we follow an intricate intertwining of members and roommate lovers and the inevitable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow the dialogue of this movie carefully enough, you will have no reason to be disappointed by the ending. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Ha Buah" is vibrant and the images are both beautiful and rigid ?? that is real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> English subtitles are very easy to follow and you will quickly relax and enjoy world cinema at its best.
