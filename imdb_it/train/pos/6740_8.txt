The all-round character of the main role of this film, that of the policeman torn from his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for his time, 1950. <br /> <br /> Together with music disturbing and well written, the film is a great example of a noir film at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal inner anguish, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who does not tolerate nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the district. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this kind of film on his own. If there is any fault it would be with the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney who looks strangely out of place with the hardened cop. Their coffee scenes, however, are wonderful and sound real. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in his father's side, is just as perfect as Gary Merrill is the hood. Excellent lighting and atmosphere. The building where mortal actions take place highly atmospheric, I love the old in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
