The Last of the Blond Bombshells is a fun little piece of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman. He spent most of his life being his dutiful wife and mother, but he was never really happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick-in-the-mud kids when she locates a street artist. This sparkles memories of being a member of a girls swing band in London during World War II. Soon we find out that the band wasn't exactly all girl, since the drummer was a man dressed as a woman. Some Like It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth brings out her sax (which she practiced in secret throughout her marriage) and joins forces with the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist, and the money starts to flow. He does not take money because he is rich and does not need it. His way of playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm) who was the band's drummer. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - rather the man of women, and Elizabeth - being only a fifteen at the time - was the only member of the band who had no experience of Patrick's "talents" besides the drums. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her niece to reunite the old group to play for her granddaughter's school dance. Thus began a delightful journey into memory, combined with aspects of a humorous film on the road - all seasoned with really good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I think I am at the age when I have a lot of fun the older actresses do their thing, and this film is a treasure as it is not only the protagonist of Judi Dench, but it is supported by none other from Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and a host of British actresses. All this is completed by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fluff, but totally delicious and extremely fun.
