Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best and most fluid animations and cleverly written dialogues of any Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced of it in the first 15 minutes. In particular, I love the vocal work of Don Novello on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad that the whole film seems to move at a rate twice that of what would be appropriate, at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis does not provide. It is at best average. In the middle of the film there is a mediocre turn. That's all. It's still a good movie. Everyone should verify it.
