This film was fantastic and even with a not very convincing ending, it's still worth seeing. The film begins when Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a boy jumps up and announces that Colbert CANNOT marry because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate they find that the peace judge and many others remember his marriage and there is even a signed marriage license! Slowly, it becomes clear that Claudette's mind is slipping and the people around her seriously question her sanity. Then, when the alleged first husband is murdered, all the evidence and suspicions fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is an exciting film of mysterious suspense, like what I have described so far is only the first half of the film. What follows is incredibly smart and engaging. Unfortunately, the conclusion, however, is a bit disappointing, since the driving force behind it all turns out to be "just outside the left field" - and it's disconcerting since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information provided to the viewer. However, despite this, the film was so good, I can even excuse the loose end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as a "jointed boyfriend", although apart from him the other performances were excellent.
