I really enjoyed this movie, I saw the original classic a few times, but I barely remember the details. I think this film is much better than the cartoon, it's not so black and white. I particularly liked the way they made the character so complete and explained why it was so, the villain in this film was not the real Grinch but the major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for the whole part a great movie made for children and adults.
