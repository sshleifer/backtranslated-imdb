Intransigent look in a 21st century suburb Vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters from former documentary filmmaker U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalist and intense film of observation. <br /> <br /> After the worldwide release of Big Brother's reality shows, Hundstage brings modern voyeurism to a disturbing and profound level. A European art film difficult to love but not reprehensible may seem cruel and squalid, but it manages to convey the nihilistic and alienated feeling of modern society in a commendable way. <br /> <br /> A must for lovers of world cinema.
