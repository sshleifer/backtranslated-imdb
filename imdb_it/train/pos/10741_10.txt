Naudet's French brothers did something that no one else did, they had a video camera the day this tragedy happened. They were in Building n. 2, when you saw cards drifting away, the people hitting the ground jumping from such a height. <br /> <br /> I mean it comes up until both buildings collapsed and they ran, their camera was still running, when the white dust covered them, they found a door to the store and entered , but all this footage is real and I think they did a great job capturing it for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary film that I watch every 9/11, so I'll never forget what this country has been through. I think if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of the priest of the fire brigade, while he was being transported to church and his honorable funeral.
