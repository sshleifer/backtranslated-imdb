I thought King Solomon's Mines had been well made. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was superb but her makeup and hair were not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see a sturdy and seasoned actor in this role after filming films after film with light-skinned, fair-skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version cannot be compared to the 50s version with Stewart Grainger. It was a movie on a big screen and not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were credible, but the two media must be kept separate. I look forward to seeing him again, and I hope Patrick Swayze will look again at this kind of role.
