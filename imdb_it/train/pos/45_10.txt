Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had a drama in your life. It makes you want to see more. You wonder what the secret of Alicia is hiding. I think I saw that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Besides, I don't usually cry for movies, but this made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like that. All in All I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at yourself, the more you become part of it. The end is the part that really struck me when he cried when he got his diploma, because he had his daughter's name. My heart felt like it had broken at that moment. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she still hadn't gotten her. I loved it so much
