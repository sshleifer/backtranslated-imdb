Generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their people. I particularly liked the plot, even though you knew what was going to happen it kept giving the element of surprise for the whole movie. However, I find that coming to the end it may have been a little longer (maybe extended) - to me it seemed like it was a little rushed; as if the writer was trying to remove the laundry from the lines before the rain fell. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? As far as we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he did the whole thing ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Could be? If there is .. I can't wait to see it.
