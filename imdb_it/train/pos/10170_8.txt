In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film was actually surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see it and I expected to be bored by the clich√©s, the obvious jokes and the excessive, all that the trailer had promised. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes I really found myself laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. With a single 'toilet humor' gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to create realistically amusing scenarios and, without ruining anything, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there; script, director and actors and compared to other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film is high. <br /> <br /> Of course, you will not learn anything or you will have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will most likely have fun!
