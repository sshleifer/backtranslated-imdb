My father grew up watching George Reeves as Superman and when I was a kid he had episodes on the VHS and he allowed me to see them, including this movie (making them pass as a family if you want), and I loved it. <Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with the oil mine and from the mine emerge annoying radioactive men targeted by the city that are presumed to be deadly and it's up to Superman to stop this chaos. <br /> <br /> It's simply wonderful and fun to see. Special effects and old-fashioned sound - the crew brought out such beauty with such small technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a kid, and I am 16 now, it just serves to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.
