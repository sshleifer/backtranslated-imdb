Intelligent, gritty, witty, frantic, sexy, extravagant, squalid, erotic, sincere and courageous, Footlight Parade is a first-rate entertainment that films are made of. <br /> <br /> The realistic, satirical treatment gives a new cut to the material and its rhythm and delivery are breathtaking. To think that only 7 years ago they started making talking pictures! The brilliance of dialogue cannot be matched everywhere, especially considering that "realism" has taken over and swallowed contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was made at a time when the content of the Hayes code was ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and living cinema that speaks directly to the contemporary audience that suffers through depression and the general anxiety of the time. I would recommend watching a film of this period, 1930-1935, for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be.
