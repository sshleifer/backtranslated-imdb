Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, the Rostov Ripper, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation was hampered by the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate crimes. He does the job so brilliantly that he will leave no one intact. At first it is perhaps a little slow in pace, but it really catches you while the story unfolds. I can only say that, alongside "The Silence of the Lambs", this is by far the best film about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say what the actor's performance is that stands out from the others in this film. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as an inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigations. Donald Sutherland's performance as his superior cynic, and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him, is as exceptional as Rea's. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, who plays the serial killer? DuMann has brilliantly created a character that inspires empathy rather than hate. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his collaborators ... He is tortured, shameful, as well as extremely vicious. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this film to anyone interested in a well-made docu-drama, in which the actors are even more important than the special effects. Deserves at least a 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
