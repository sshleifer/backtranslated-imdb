This very underrated film is (to me) what a good script in a film should be. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and exposes it to everyone to see and wonder. The film talks about the divisions that people create to isolate themselves from the violence, hatred and bigotry of everyday life. <br /> <br /> We are asked questions and questions about life along the way. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks "Is my film a violent film (and by extension our enjoyment of it) that causes violence in society?" Claire asks "What kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life?" Mack is not immune from the moment he asks: "Is it possible to overcome the limits of the race and (an even more difficult step) finance?" Of course they are not mentioned in the film, but generic, others also ask their questions and to be honest it raises more than it answers. <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of life. We strive to find answers to the questions we will never answer completely, and in some cases we must give adequate answers to our needs and desires. As human beings who thrive on issues we cannot answer Some answers are real. Claire and Mack realize that even if they could take the easy way and let the state take the child, they found responsibility for his life in their hands, some answers no. Davis "sees the light" and decides not to make violent films, but the next day he turns around and refuses his epiphany as subordinate to his art. <br /> <br /> We all seek answers, this film does not respond, it simply reminds you to keep looking for answers. <br /> <br />
