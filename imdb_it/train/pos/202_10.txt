Give this Movie to 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors featured in this film + director Herbert Ross, and this makes it possible to adapt this stage. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70s. I love the kind of humor in this movie, it makes me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper, just $ 3). I looked at it as soon as I got home, but I had to watch it again because I missed some parts the first time. The second time I saw him, I felt much better, and I laughed a lot harder. I definitely intend to re-get this on DVD because I MUST see the special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how this happens. Two people work together as entertainers / actors / actors. They get along on stage, but they really argue offstage, they can't survive another minute with each other, then about 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a television special. You can find it in this movie. Matthau & Burns were fantastic in this film. It's a pity they died. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong comic interpretation. He was also 78 years old when this film was shot. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an academic award in old age. Jessica Tandy beats the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He deserved that Golden Globe. Although many people may not agree with what I'm about to say, everyone in this film has performed well. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. Another thing: anyone who hates this movie is a "Putz"
