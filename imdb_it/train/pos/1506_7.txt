Before such films as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween" changed the vision of horror forever, there was a more Gothic and much less violent era in the genre. Movies like the Hammer Horror series and "Rosemary's Baby" were the frightened and enthusiastic spectators of the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I rented this movie during my childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombie movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production of the famous but sadly disappeared film company Amicus were a good start. <br /> <br /> A great and disturbing soundtrack. Excellent performance from a stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography. Plenty of chills and old chills, especially in the first and last vignette. Some moments and haunting images. It moves at a slow but steady pace. The house is a ghostly and oppressive dwelling. Great sets and sets, which give the film a true gothic horror atmosphere. It depends more on the mood and chills without blood than on the naked and free nudity for his chills. <br /> <br /> Cons: Some rhythm problems in the first half. In addition to "The Cloak", the rest of the stories seem to have already been done before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, "Waxworks", plays well and is a moment, but it is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and suspense. The low budget is sometimes shown. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: after seeing this film for the first time in many years, I can understand why I rented it so often. It is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good example of an era in which horror films were made with style and class. Look at this with the lights out. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
