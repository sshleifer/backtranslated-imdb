If you love science-fiction Sci-Fi 70s like I do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" than you'll like this. It is a stream of spectacular awareness of the 70s, including a 12th century landfill and the Earth in a million years. This film is pure 70s. Wear "Fly Like An Eagle" by Steve Miller or "Dark Side Of The Moon" by Pink Floyd and you're ready to go!
