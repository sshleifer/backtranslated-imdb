Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and deserves respect for having tried it, but he is not in a class with great Shakespearians like Olivier and Welles; and suffers further from Kenneth Branagh. This brilliant Irishman cleanly steals the show. Olivier recognized that potential in his production and chose Iago with someone he knew he could stage. I hardly understood the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see even the view of Venice.
