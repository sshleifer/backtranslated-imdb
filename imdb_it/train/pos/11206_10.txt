I haven't seen this movie! At least not in its entirety. I saw some disturbing clips that let me gag to see everything. A sequence remains in my memory until today. A spaceship (very convincing) orbits around the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash device to photograph the surface hidden beneath him. The moon flashes in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds, here it is. Parallel lines, squares, could be .. then the light fades and the brief look at ... what ... is over and it is time for the spaceship to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've also seen some other clips, but I'd like to have the complete movie.
