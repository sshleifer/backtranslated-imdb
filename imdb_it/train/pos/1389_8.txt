The Williams family lives on a ranch in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in considerable danger when the place is suddenly pushed into a temporal vortex in which the past, the present and the future collide in a chaotic and unpredictable way. Director John "Bud" Cardos starts the film on a compelling and mysterious note and gradually allows things to become stranger, crazier and more exciting as the storyline of the cycle unfolds. Furthermore, Cardos fills the screen with a lot of dazzling visual effects and does a good job in creating an authentic sense of awe and wonder. The admirably sincere acting of a game cast qualifies as another important advantage: Jim Davis as rich patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the worried Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny and Scott C. Kolden as the brave Steve. Funky special effects offer an inspired combination of gnarled miniatures, animated stop-motion animated monsters (those creatures include a slender, hairless boy, a large lumpy beast and a skinny lizard) and beautiful opaque paintings. Richard Band's orchestral soundtrack is really exciting. Even the crisp and solar cinematography of John Arthur Morrill does the same. A funny movie.
