Hi, Game mates. I recently saw this film for the first time and it is also my first experience with Arthur Askey, I must admit I was very impressed with this film. As a fan of black and white films in general, passport for pimlic, the lavender crowd and Tommy Trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this film attracted the fact that it provided good old British humor. I noticed that there are some here who have criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion it is the test of time as a fine example of comic acting of the forties and if something adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than just stereotypes that looks like you can dominate the movies now. If you can get this movie, I suggest you put it into practice, too bad that these films are no longer shown on Sunday afternoons. I'm also happy to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (Godfrey private in Dad's army). I thank you
