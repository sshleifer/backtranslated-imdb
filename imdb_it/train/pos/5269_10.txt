I love bad movies. Not only that, because they are often fun as "really" "good" movies (like the Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they are often much better than those movies. And this is why I love the Italian cinema of the 70s and 80s. And this is why I particularly love this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> The director Ruggero Deodato has made some really good films, like House on the Edge of the Park, and even his Atlantis Interceptors and live like a policeman, Die Like a Man are action movies fun. But this is really bad. The barbarians is such an idiotic film. Peter and David Paul as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny, due to their lack of charisma and ability to act. But if they can't act, they scream and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, people try to hang the Barbarian Brothers, and escape a very extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, in reality everything is bad in this film. I can't describe how much I laughed when I saw this first time. The Barbarians & the Company is a classic course that everyone should see once. If you thought that Plan 9 From Outer Space is a fun camp, this will be a real killer.
