This film has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootings, bad guys and worst boys. It's fun to see James Belushi use his humor to get out of the trouble he'd gotten himself into since he stole $ 12 million from the last big boss "The Skipper." It seems trivial, of course. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, it's much better than anything that has been done with direct DVD garbage made today. If you manage to overcome the stupid plot, you will find that this film has some surprises in store. You could argue that the twists are predictable, but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you too much time to think about it too much, which is a blessing since this film isn't about revealing the final touch. that moment, only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie, they probably expected a mafia film instead of some crooks that crossed each other.
