After examining this intense martial arts film for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that it has lost none of its mysticism, nor any of its amazing martial arts actions as I remembered from my youth. The story of a martial arts master who sends his "unfinished" student to look for the 5 members of his Poison Clan, so they don't look for a fortune that the master's friend keeps hidden. Afraid that his last pupil has not had enough training, he instructs him to make friends with one of the five "poisons" in order to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough about the choreography or photographic work. A beautiful film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts films ever made. A CLASSIC!!
