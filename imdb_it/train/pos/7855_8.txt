Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle that I intended to get for a while. In the end I found a VHS copy at a reasonable price and I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives the typical frightening and innocently sexy portrait of a girl on the wrong side who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time the stakes are higher: a false accusation of murder, an illegitimate child (and the consequent case of bad motherhood) and contemplated suicide. <br /> <br /> We see why Pickford wanted to do this again. History is a true moral story, the type he loved to interpret. The controversial topics are not always clearly explained; a spectator must pay attention and collect suggestions to capture everything that is implied in first sight ?? even if in the end everything is more or less explained. <br /> <br /> The only negative remark I can make concerns Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, appears to be around 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary, of course!), Is sent fleeing in a panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab loads at him ! Then, to complete the work (or perhaps to justify his perplexed fear of the dog), he manages to nail him to the ground and somehow wounds him so much that he is still struggling to get up much later, like a bad storm hits! This is the same lovely laboratory that sleeps with Federico (Lloyd Hughes) and cuddles with Mary! And yet, later, Mary throws boiling water on Ben's face, which barely slows him down! OK, I vented on Ben and the chocolate lab! Apart from that, the film was quite touching and certainly caught my eye. Pickford's supporting cast was strong and credible. This is certainly among his best films.
