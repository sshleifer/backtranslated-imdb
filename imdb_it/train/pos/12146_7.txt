The return to the 36th room is one of those classic Kung-Fu films that Shaw produces in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to Hollywood spaghetti westerns, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the western counterpart of Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is "Presented in Shaw Scope", just like in the good old days. <br /> <br /> This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less summarizes the narrative of martial arts films of that era. <br /> <br /> Act I sets the premise. Workers in a small village windmill are not happy with their fate, as their salaries have been reduced by 20% by incoming gangsters. They can't do much for their exploitation because none of them is a martial art expert at fighting gangsters and their boss. At first they had less success in convincing Liu to imitate a highly qualified Shaolin monk (one of the best comic sequences), but their role was exposed when they pushed to the limit of credibility impersonating too many times. <br /> <br /> Act Two shows the protagonist who wants to get back to the crowd. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a trip to the Shaolin Temple, to try to infiltrate and learn the martial arts quietly. After a few moments slapstick, he is finally accepted by the abbot (who he personified!) But he is disappointed by the teaching methods - a bit like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he manages to erect scaffolding around the temple. Nothing can hold down a good man, and unknowingly build strength, resistance, and learn the unorthodox way to kung-fu. <br /> <br /> The Third Act is where the fight party begins. With typical sound effects, the maximum impact is given to any obvious non-contact on film. But it's quite refreshing to watch the fighting scenes here, with its wide-angle shots to highlight the clarity and detail between sparring mates, and the use of slow motion just to show stunts in different angles. You can find the speed of the fights a little too slow, with some pauses between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his ad-nausem style used in Hollywood movies, they definitely don't do fight scenes like before! The return to the 36th room is repeated Monday, so if you are looking for a nostalgic journey into the past, what are you waiting for?
