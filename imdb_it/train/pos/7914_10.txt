I probably saw this movie for the first time in 1995. Since then I've been back many times. It's great! I particularly like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Wow! This was so beautiful in the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me, as I know the movie "Tron" was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early 1990s. It was probably the first collaboration of several CG experiments set to music. I like it so much, I think I'll go see it now. Hello
