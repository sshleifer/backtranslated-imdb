It is surprising that the actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, # 1 fan of the Ramones punk rock band, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School". Soles is so exuberant, you don't mind that she's obviously too old to still be in high school (the fact is leveled making all the kids look like 24). The film is a frantic game that does not escape; in the end everything is blown into a thousand pieces, and this is how it should be. Mary Woronov, a strangely extravagant and amusing presence like the Nazi headmaster, first gets an exceptional piece, one of a kind, where Frisbees flies dangerously close to his head (how many holds did he use on that, or was it a case?) and Dey Young is very attractive as the best of Soles, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, ironically, in this "high school" gang are the Ramones. They can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment lasts too long. A Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is considered a fantasy and is well captured; other secondary songs are good, in particular a rare ballad by Paul McCartney listened to at the beginning ("Did we meet somewhere before?"). Great fun! *** from ****
