As far as I know, this show was never repeated on UK television after its original run in the late 60s and early 70s, and most of the episodes now sadly "lack presumed deleted ". <br /> <br /> Series 6 since 1971 however still exists in its entirety, and I recently had the chance to see everything, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After returning home from school, the Freewheelers were an essential vision for me and many of my peers again in those days of flared trousers, Slade and Chicory Tip. And watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat. <br /> <br /> No matter the bad / friendly acting, the involuntarily amusing fight scenes, the sufficiently large plot holes to pilot a large yacht that crosses the ocean and the "frighteningly, frighteningly" RADA accents of the protagonists . <br /> <br /> No - forget everything. Because the Freewheelers go back to a bygone age (I would say "golden") of children's television drama, when the shows were simply ghostly fun and they didn't take themselves so seriously. Before they became obsessed with all the "ishoos" full of anguish that today's writers have their young protagonists, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, sexually transmitted infections etc. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly if he were "redone for a modern public" in these days of pervasive political honesty, the figure of the boss would be a black female, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be a white boy confused about his sexuality and the girl would be a go-getter of all actions with an out-of-scale IQ, which would always make the boys disappear from scratches and make them look foolish - in other words a million miles removed from the wiper deferential and distal of the ankle of Wendy Padbury. <br /> <br /> It is a show that is "much of its time". But is this a bad thing? I don't think so first.
