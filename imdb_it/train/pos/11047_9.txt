I had waited a few years before this film was finally released in England, but in many ways it made me very happy when I finally saw it. There are a lot of great things for the film, to start acting. It's not something I really need in a horror movie, but the people in this movie are all very good. This and the constantly compelling and interesting script, with a pleasant, typically Lovecraftian feel, give the film a true solid backbone. Add to this the doses of surreal nightly images and occasional occasional gore and winning films. He also has my favorite kind of gore, supernatural and lousy. Moreover, the characters of Marcus, the angry transsexual of bodybuilding and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / toy are really bizarre and sometimes unnerving, and give a far, anything has a sense of morbid grown up madness that works well with the frequent Freudian shades. This is one of the most impressive recent horror films, much more shocking or out there than Hollywood can produce. My only complaint is that I wanted the finish to be darker, but it still works, so overall I would really recommend it to serious horror fans.
