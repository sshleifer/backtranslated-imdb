Chris Rock plays this remake of Heaven Can Wait by Warren Beatty (a remake of the 1941 movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time, before he can realize his dreams and adventures in his new body (even if temporary). In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a reserve quarterback for the then Los Angeles Rams. In the hippy version of Rock, our main character is a young and definitely not very talented comedian. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun to see the sharp rock like a bad presenter. It's a bit like watching Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur evening. But every time he tries his material, he is whistled loudly on stage - so much so that his nickname becomes "Booie". His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is all that the real Chris Rock is not. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a messenger of bicycles, and is going around the streets to try even more material when BAM! He's hit by a truck. Okay, so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second before by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he would have been hit anyway. No dice, it seems that Lance is not due in Heaven until 2044. What to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the "manager" of Heaven, reluctantly accepts to find a new body for the not-all-dead Mr. Barton. The problem is that the body they find is greedy, old white. It turns out that this guy (a Mr. Wellington) has all kinds of things - he's the fifteenth richest man in the country! So lucky! You can imagine how Lance will change things. <br /> <br /> But of course, while in the body of the wealthy Wellington, Lance falls in love with a beautiful hospital worker (Regina King). We males know how difficult it is to find a female given to our body, but try to win one while you are an old stocky white man! And it's even worse when you're not impressed by your money. <br /> <br /> This is Rock's first hit at a leading role, and I think he behaves admirably. There's still a lot of comic in him - and, of course, if he ever wants to have different roles, he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script - but this isn't really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his driving, his delivery, his behavior and his passion - are what feed this film. He is clearly having a lot of fun in the role, and seems intent on making you enjoy watching him.
