A very strong film. Bruce is good and even Brad. <br /> <br /> I think there are two cities missing from the list of receptionists on the list Bruce remembered. <br /> <br /> This means that the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, Novikov's ownership seems to work in this movie. However, I believe in Back to the future theory on the multiplicity of worlds. <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds man can meet. <br /> <br /> And I believe there are no problems in this. Here I disagree with Dr. Brown of Back ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 Monkeys has its beauty. Despite all these theories of one world or many or continuous, one can believe he is really crazy and the doctor - his girlfriend has just been lost. <br /> <br /> A sequence of events that can lead you to believe that he is from the future. The bullet - well it could be a mistake, some falsification. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - must buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> The best.
