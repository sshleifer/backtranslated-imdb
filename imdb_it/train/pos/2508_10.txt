This movie is fantastic. The plot was ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde, after growing up in the American world of actors who can't sing and singers who can't play. <br /> <br /> In this film, a young Sho (Gackt) meets a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live with others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but not a sweet one. The plot was really unique and contrary to the typical vampire movie. The script was full of twists and very compelling. <br /> <br /> The only fault I could say about the film was, despite the lack of a happy, even if quiet, fine, it would be its multiple languages. I had the unpublished version (I'm lucky I understood everything except some of the Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film was simply fantastic.
