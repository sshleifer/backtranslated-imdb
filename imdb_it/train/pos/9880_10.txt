This film was made in 1943 when I think Judy was at its peak (it seems wise). In his previous film For Me and My Gal, people often say he looks emaciated. Well in this film it looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows a talent for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun, especially in the beginning, when it's trying to arrange an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes in my opinion is Judy's rendition of Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean a minute that he despises her and the next time they go out on a date, the next time they meet after that date, they're in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I didn't like was the opening night. If I were Lily I would be furious with John, but he isn't ... it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> But all in all, I should give this film a 10 because it's simply wonderful and almost perfect.
