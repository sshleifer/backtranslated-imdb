Like A Streetcar Named Desire (also directed by Gadg on stage and on screen), Panic In The Streets represents a New Orleans in which its main fame as a celebrity - the birthplace of Jazz - is not even mentioned. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and it was probably a long way to affirm it as the best actor he was, rather than just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in a role not accredited as an assistant at the morgue, but the film is full of talents that begin with Jack Palance (still known as Walter Jack Palance) while the local "Big" followed the Zero Mostel shooting, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus the solid and reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who approaches Dr. Widmark's point of view. It is a very rewarding film to be seen very little. Take it if you can.
