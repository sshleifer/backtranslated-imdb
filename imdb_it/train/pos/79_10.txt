I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963). Too bad Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear. He was excellent in the show. Of course Walter Brennan was as good as Tony Martínez. I loved it when it called Amos Señor Grampa. I purchased Season I on DVD and can't wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If only there were more shows on television like this, it would all be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless all the dead members of the cast and, please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known to the public again. You are loved and respected. The Real Mc Coys will live forever.
