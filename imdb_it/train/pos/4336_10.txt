The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, his sisters and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is fun, moving and inspiring. It led me to re-evaluate my relationship with my dead father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been a better cast. I hope both Mr Falk and Mr Reiser are recognized in next year's cinema awards for their efforts: Falk for his performance and Reiser for the script.
