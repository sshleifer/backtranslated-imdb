The romantic drama of the working class of director Martin Ritt is incredible as they come, but there are moments of pleasure due mainly to the charisma of the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both formidable). She is a widow who cannot go on, she is illiterate and a closet inventor - you can probably guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a better title!) Is so relaxed that it borders on the bland and the editing of the film is a disaster, but it is still pleasant; a blue collar fantasy in pink colors. There are no openings to serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is just a plot tool for the following love story) and no real fireworks, even if the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the derivations are resized to an interesting extent. The finish is pure fluff - and the cynics will find it difficult to swallow - although these two characters deserve a happy ending and the image would not be really satisfying in any other way. *** from ****
