My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We looked at it a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad a new Pokemon didn't speak this time. I will get used to it. <br /> <br /> The iron mask marauder was rather mediocre when he captured Celebi with his dark sphere. Good Thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of his control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE performed by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever It has become a hit from the previous three films and people will always love that movie.
