. . . it's as good as the original. It almost reaches greatness thanks to Cundieff's remarkable ear for music and dialogue. The self-important bravado of hip-hop whores blows. The "Niggaz with Hats" (NWH) group is every rap group you've ever heard and completely self-parodic. The wardrobe is incredible. Buy the OOP soundtrack if you can.
