I had this film on tape for years and I started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry - what an irony!) Especially because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's music again. I ended up sitting around the first half hour, entranced by how wonderfully secured the direction, writing and performances were. The film is like a who's who of the stars of the 50s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and in particular Ernest Thesiger, as big as the old dried textile giant. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not protagonists of characters as such but fascinating and charismatic protagonists. This is science fiction in its purest form and comedy comedy. An all-time classic, and I hope nobody ever tries to do it again!
