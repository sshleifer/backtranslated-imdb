Good action show, but nothing new. This happened in the high mountains, which showed beautiful landscapes and things like that. A man hires a group of mercenaries, lead flies, and he kicks. It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was like that. He had a very effective scene right in the first part of the film that made me shudder with horror. Not a bad photo, just the same old one, the same old one.
