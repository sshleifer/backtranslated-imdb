This is a lukewarm docu-drama that does not cover any new terrain, re-elaborates all the clich√©s and is sloppy with facts. For example, Monaco is a very flat city. So why is it hilly in the film? For example, the end of the Great War of 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. Yet it is announced as a surrender. For example, European news vendors did not shout (and do not) while they headline their newspapers. Yet this strictly American custom is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until they took power, but there it is on the lectern as Hitler offers one of his stem winders. In fact, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than the Hitler oratory. The film also perpetuates the myth that the brewery's putsch was hatched at the Hoffbrauhaus in Munich. It was not. Robert Carlyle interprets his subject well. But his supporting cast is adequate at most and very often not even that. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can only hope that the second is better but don't bet on it.
