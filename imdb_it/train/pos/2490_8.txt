Those of the "Instant Gratification" era of horror films will no doubt complain about the rhythm of this film and the lack of free effects and body counting. The fact is that "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. <br /> <br /> If you avoid the indie racks because you're sick of boring teenagers or twenty who are killed by a madman whose back-story may have come out of the back of a Count Chocula box, "The Empty Acre "is the film for you. <br /> <br /> Set in the decomposing remains of the American rural dream, "The Empty Acre" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. When the weak relationship of the couple falls apart, a broader story takes place in the background. At night, a shapeless dark mass moves away from a barren acre of the sun on their farm and seems to be devouring anything in its path, leaving no sign that it was ever there. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues about what is happening and ends with a well-executed ending that resonates with enough questions left to validate the writer / director's trust in an intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a text subtitle concerning the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the film an allegory. Covering, well acted and technically astute, "The Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that horror fans should love.
