"Fever Pitch" is a sweet and fascinating addition to the small genre of animated novels such as date films or films that a son might be willing to go with his mother (even though the audience's boys became restless during the romantic scenes ). br /> <br /> I experienced a milder version of a story like that, as my first exposure to baseball was coming out with my husband the spring after the first Mets World Series win and then I saw the Mets win over their neighbor because I was the other one still in the small hours with our two young children, who grew up to teach me more about baseball through the other heartbreaking failures of our local National League neighborhood to win again (and it was me who brought our eldest son to his only game of Fenway Park when I got a little Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston). <br /> <br /> So compared to reality, the script credibly creates two people with real work. It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore's character is a substantial workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills, although he visits practically only with his three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow him to do a lot of jiggling and secondary stories minors with his parents do not fully work. <br /> <br /> It is also credibly set up as he meets the math teacher from Jimmy Fallon and how he falls in love with his "winter boy" - although it is surprising that his Red Sox apartment filled with apartment does not miss her summer boy "Jekyll-and-Hyde". Their relational crisis during the baseball season also takes place in a pleasantly adult way, from compromise efforts to his frank challenges to him, centering on the fact that they both face thirty years and singles. Fallon surprisingly achieves the gradual emotional maturity of his character. <br /> <br /> As the final borrows heavily from O. Henry, the writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the incredible Sox 2004 season into a revised storyline (with much collaboration from the Red Sox organization for shooting at the stadium). <br /> <br /> The script goes out of its way to explain why Fallon does not have a Boston accent, as an immigrant from New Jersey, but this does not explain why his heterogeneous friends do not. The most authentic sounds of Boston come from most of his "summer family" of other season ticket holders, who kindly chiseled the basics of the Sox tradition to win over the Barrymore neophyte (and all members of the public). <br /> <br /> The song selection includes many favorites of Red Sox fans, from the initial notes of the classic "Dirty Water", although most are required to be heard on the end credits as if they were listening local radio and it's worth listening to.
