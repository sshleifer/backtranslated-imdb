"Kaabee" describes a woman's difficulties during World War II and during World War II, raising her children by herself after her husband was imprisoned for "thought crime". This film was directed by Yamada Youji and, as expected, the atmosphere of this film is truly wonderful. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspect. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is absolutely incredible. I am baffled by the way they managed to gather this all-star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps the most decorated still-active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube was also very nice in a supporting role. It was Asano Tadanobu, who made the most impressive performance, perfectly interpreting the wit of his character and the difficult situation he was in. <br /> <br /> Films with pre-war settings are not my thing, but thanks to wonderful direction and acting, I was totally absorbed in the story. Furthermore, it was not an extreme left-wing nonsense like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and examines the controversial and delicate issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred at that time in Japan. Excellent movie, highly recommended for all viewers.
