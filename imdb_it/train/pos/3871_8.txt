Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman who lives in an overcrowded Jewish ghetto in 19th-century England. It is surrounded by architectures of looming bricks, oppressive, desolate, anonymous, worn, narrow sidewalks and streets, darkened windows and hordes of crowds in black and brown. <br /> <br /> He lives in a tiny apartment with his large family that runs a clothing store inside the apartment. As a child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and her brothers who ridiculed her for having imitated them from boredom. <br /> <br /> young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, she lives in a state of mental and physical boiling and lethargy and inertia, she exudes an empty and shapeless expression, she is dressed in simple clothes and insignificant, and is continually oppressed and diminished by the gray, worldly, imposing and massive buildings, the narrow streets, the narrow corridors and narrow doors, and his mother and his brothers with his mouth open, and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of his family. <br /> <br /> Its unique form of mental escape is Yiddish theater. Sitting on the balcony, in the front row, leaning against the parapet, there is a vast space between her mind and the stage, a space that allows her to breathe, think, feel and desire. <br /> <br /> Yet despite the freedom of thought that the stage offers Esther, her face and body remain incredibly sleepy, impassive, dispassionate. <br /> <br /> The aesthetic and common aspect of Summer Phoenix brilliantly conveys the demeanor without emotion of Esther - Summer / Esther does not convey any desire to want something or to anticipate anything. <br /> <br /> After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to free herself from the squalid life she is trapped in. <br /> <br /> She is eventually shown in minor parts in some theatrical performances, and meets Nathan Quellen, played by British actor Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the technical skill of acting. <br /> <br /> From this point on, Esther begins a grueling double journey to learn how to behave and how to learn to feel. <br /> <br /> Start experiencing emotions that you have never experienced before, and begin to gain the experience you need to understand and master the technical aspects of acting. <br /> <br /> Nathan accompanies you through the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc; then he starts walking through those emotions in his personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, Nathan tells her, the truth about how a character reacts, the truth about how the actor would react, and the truth that a character and an actor are not the same person. <br /> <br /> These technical passages and three truths slowly deconstruct the defenses of Esther and lead her to two uplifting experiences in the end of the film that mark the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement and emotion. <br /> <br /> Esther Kahn is a technically demanding film to watch due to its strange and narrow shots, the poor definition of the photo that conveys the fairy-tale realism set in the Ghetto, and the unmistakable characters of Summer Phoenix and bland portrait and unpleasant that brilliantly conveys Kahn's mental and physical ego and lethargy and opaque nature. <br /> <br /> An unmissable film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting and for people who appreciate ilmi and character studies.
