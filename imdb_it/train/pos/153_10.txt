This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is brilliantly moved by intense images that deeply move the sensitive spectator. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War while a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact, they are playing a version of what they saw in the adult world around them in their world. Later we meet again three of these children as adults in a sanatorium. Here we see what life has worked on each of them. One is a sexually repressed recluse patient. Another man is a braggart who got sick. The third daughter, a young woman, has become a nun and serves at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory on the effect of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This film has a climax that is certainly not for picky members of the public, but it is logical and deeply moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. There is a musical score that provides a background of terror in this film. This is not a movie for those who love the thrill, but a film for an attentive audience.
