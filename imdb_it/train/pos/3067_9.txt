How amazing to find on late television. If I had only read a short plot on a television list before seeing the film, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie about a man-who-sees-an-asshole-who wants to leave the business-and-falling-in-love .... seems trivial. But the film works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man has a burden on his shoulders, even before he says a word. The graphic aspect of the film is perfect. dark, but not hateful. <br /> <br /> Apart from the appearance of the hit-man family that provides a touch of surrealism, Macy's character is grappling with her marriage and her father's control. Macy shows a repressed sadness and her bedtime talk to her young son is incredible. The boy shows acting skills well beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I can't believe I found it by chance on late night television.
