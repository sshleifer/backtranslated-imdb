so in mid-season, I was so involved in school and my activities that I didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway, which is bad. <br /> <br /> I think that the followers of this show should write foxes and ask them to at least finish filming so that a season can be released on DVD later. perhaps then they will see how many people have been disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and watched it anxiously every Thursday after the OC. Can you imagine my disappointment when I returned to try watching the show only to find that it had disappeared? needless to say, I am not very happy with the fox now. even more after discovering that NO ENDING HAS BEEN MOVED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. a half-shot show is like a half-done machine, it's practically useless. fox, film the damn conclusion and give some fans of the show some peace.
