I loved this movie from the opening sequence to the end. I found the style of the director / actor that directly addresses me / the very engaging audience. <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing about this film was its ignorance, and therefore provocative, of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment - and acceptance of oneself and the characters - allowed me to embrace them and get involved in their world. Without preaching and with gentle and loving humor and intelligence, this film has the power to open up to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
