I saw both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing it in the theater. I've been waiting for this since before filming began. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Less spoiler under- <br /> <br /> Overall it was good, but the continuity of the first two was also missing. Identity and Supremacy have gracefully fluctuated between adrenaline action and introspective drama. Sometimes this film has become unstable. The dead time for the construction of the plot was slightly too tight. This caused the following too frantic action. <br /> <br /> Camera: speaking of frenzied, Greengrass's trademark was present and very annoying to me. I know it has been spoken / complained of by nausea on the forum, but it does not mean that it is not relevant. All the martial arts exercises that the actors have been through have been completely wasted. The ridiculous cuts in the camera and the flickering camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie. It is an economic and student trick to make the film seem uncertain. I would expect these techniques to be used in some horror movies created for high school kids, but not in this classy adult games series. Even the foreground is too extreme. Do some framing. Get some interesting shots. The constant foreground seems to me a lazy direction. <br /> <br /> History: at the beginning the story was VERY confused. They entrust new names and faces to you from the beginning. It gave me the feeling you have when you get back into a movie and you know you've lost some crucial information. Felt hasty or compressed due to time constraints. After recovering, however, the story is pretty good. It is nice to follow contacts with Bourne. HOWEVER, I didn't care about the whole Supremacy scene (Landy / Bourne on the phone) in the middle of Ultimatum. In practice it makes the film a half prequel. I thought it was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: the star of the film is action. Obviously there are only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. That team was strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect and trust. Unless I completely lost something, they never even told you why they cooperated. The other killers in the film were pretty quiet. I felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / anyone who wanted to leave no margins open. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy .. Those scenes were phenomenal. These killers are not as interesting as Castel (the first violin fights in Identit√†). The cast in general degraded as the series progressed. Clive Owen was practically an afterthought. This is a measure of strength for that first cast. Second, they basically mistake Chris Cooper for Joan Allen ... Not exactly the same. This exchanges Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to name later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names that come to mind for this type of series. Apart from a couple of pauses that seemed long, the acting was perfect. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was successful. They seemed to want to get the series with them. If they had cut or reorganized the slower parts, completely eliminated the part of Scott Glenn, zoomed and removed the camera from the victim of the kidnapping, it would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> ENO SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don't see why they leave Bourne alive in the end. I realized that this was the conclusion. They clearly referred to the beginning of the series with its motionless floating silhouette. I thought it would happen. A type of complete circle end. I liked that Nicky reacted to the news. <br /> <br /> SPECIFIC SPOILER NOTICE - QUOTATION FROM THE FILM BELOW - <br /> <br /> Bourne's last remark at the end "Look at this ... Look at what they give you." quoting the first killer who killed, I loved it. The final scene was great. (Except it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot Bourne, why would he do it? Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after faxing her secret file? Makes sense.)
