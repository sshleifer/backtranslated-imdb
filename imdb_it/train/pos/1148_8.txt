This is one of those films - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that keeps a viewer's interest over and over again. Light films rarely win Oscars, but those who cast Soapdish deserve it. Even after seeing the film and knowing what's coming, it's still fun to see how the various facets of the plot develop. True, all drama is melodrama; but it is entirely appropriate for a film with a soap opera background. My favorite phrase comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now, why can't I write like this?" I think it's a shame that the TV and website censors insist on all these unnecessary hygiene measures.
