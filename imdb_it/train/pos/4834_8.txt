For anyone wishing to have an idea of ​​the Soviet vision of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of old photographs that improve in black and white during the middle of the century and in color when the story approaches modern times (ie in the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village, which is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the Tsarist era. Later he joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet communism into his village. His son, from the local beauty, fights the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated with a Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This film is long and slow, but absolutely logical and very well done. It can be seen in three parts.
