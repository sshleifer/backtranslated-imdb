A friend lent me this DVD, which he got from a festival director, I think. I was warned that some technical aspects of the film were a bit wobbly and that the writing was good but not exceptional. So maybe this has colored my judgment, but I have to admit I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The highlights in which the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really as good as Ernie, the main character, a bit pathetic in a nice way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent roommates who make Ernie mad. The character of Bill (Justin Lane), who spends much of the film dressed as a panda, was by far my favorite; it seemed the least one-dimensional, and it reminded me of an old college roommate so much that I called the boy after seeing the DVD. Truly a kind of amiable and very funny. Some of the recitations were good, others were so-so, but none of this was bad. I also loved the vigilante couple. Ridiculous and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this a high score, even if it has some problems, because you can tell when you look at it that these people cared and decided to do their movie in their own way. Congratulations to Adam Jones and the crew.
