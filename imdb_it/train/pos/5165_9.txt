This ensemble piece on adults returning to their youth training summer camp was a quiet entertainer and publisher of cinemas in the fall of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but again, some of the best films ARE released rest assured that they do not arouse much fanfare or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who is painfully good here) are the group of actors that embody these roles like people who have aged with good, bad and funny memories of past summers. This film covers the game of emotions, mostly pleasant, and the film never hits the viewer to hear what the characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to enter the memories on their own. Since I am a film observer who has a blunt and shameless handling in movies, this is something I appreciate from writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This film is a great cheap rental, a good main rent and even a nice seat in a theater movie. You could come across TV and I would definitely suggest a look-see.
