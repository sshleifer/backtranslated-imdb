I saw this film as a preview and found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a real discovery for a love story that explores intelligent, fun and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotion of the human race. <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, a real Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all perform prominently in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that there is a who's who of directors who weaves stories in intelligent and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean - WOW! This film is not a simple love story or a romantic comedy, even if it is both romantic and fun. It also has stories and series notes. But this is good in my opinion. Go see it for yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
