There is no way to approach "Zabriskie Point" from a rational point of view or attempt to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other films. This is because it is not a film. It's an idea and a feeling that the directors have somehow turned into a trivial object like a movie. What we see are not the developments of a plot, but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in the movies every day, but which we only imagine as the background that we will provide ourselves when we hear of some tragic event in the news of or from friends. We see it is our imagination of people who are abstractions to us, nobody we know, but no doubt we have heard about them in a book or on TV or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, driving and, inevitably, fleeing. Only escape is from something intangible - it is the collective situation and the cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist through laziness, or ... human nature. Set in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted suffering of modern existence. These creatures are actually empty lists that can show any trait we can imagine if we wish. Although the actions taken can be seen as criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not themselves criminals. They are human beings seeking a return to a family life, not manufactured that goes beyond the normality they experience every day. Not that they are always happy or sad, but they reach a kind of self-actualization when they move beyond and outside the suicide of modern life. They only reach true life in the natural world, even if this is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, "Zabriski Point" is a tribute to the attitude of the human sciences in the natural world. As even the most desolate parts of the earth succumb to our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the path of the death of the human spirit.
