George Raft as Steve Brodie, the carefree and dancing player who can never refuse to dare, is confronted with Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery), heavy and sentimental. A soft touch for every beggar, Connors impulsively adopts lies and strays, especially the runaway orphan "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And the homeless Lucy Calhoun, an innocent out of town with the ambition of become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this culture dominated by men, communication takes place mainly in the form of violence (it can be seen why THE BOWERY is a favorite of Martin Scorsese). Explosive cigars provide a running gag. "Swipes" enjoys throwing stones through the windows of Chinatown, on an occasion when a laundry is turned on. (The simultaneous arrival of both Brodie and Beery volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl, during which the building burns to the ground.) Beery casually sucks up an annoying girl and beats anyone who disagrees with him, including Brodie, who defeats, in a nightly quarrel on a moored barge, to regain control of his saloon, lost on a bet that Brodie would not have had the courage to jump off the Brooklyn bridge. (Brodie makes the leap, but only because a subterfuge with a mannequin fails at the last moment.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, gladly illustrating the daily life of the fillet; waiters who sing, bold bartenders, whores of Suicide Hall are dragged into the Black Maria, tailors who come off the streets unlucky from the street and force them to buy clothes they don't want. A small but admirable film.
