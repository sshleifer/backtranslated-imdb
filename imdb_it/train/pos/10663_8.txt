Here is an excellent double bill by Barbara Stanwyck on a record. The first film - and believe me the lesser of the two - is "To Please A Lady" (1950) by MGM in which it is paired with Clark Gable. Essentially it is a stellar vehicle with Gable as usual that dominates the film with its presence on the screen. Here he plays a macho pilot who gets a bad press from feminist journalist Stanwyck and begins the battle of the sexes. Obviously after a long time they end up with each other's arms and everything comes to a predictable and welcome conclusion. A bit of a stuffed toy of a move, but Gable and Stanwyck - two Golden Age icons - make it watchable! <br /> <br /> But the real meat of this DVD is the second characteristic - a wonderful and rather unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful jewel of a movie that hasn't dated a comma! Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and the mother of their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when suddenly a tragedy strikes. A falling wooden pier collapses trapping Sullivan under a heavy trellis and guess what? Yes, the tide is coming. Not having a soul in sight and unable to free himself on his own, Stanwyck leaves by car for assistance. After driving a certain distance, the only help he can collect comes from an unscrupulous prisoner (Ralph Meeker) who - in exchange for his help - wants more from her than money or a change of clothes ("I'll do anything for save my husband "). Do you or she? <br /> <br /> Meeker runs away with the image! It turns into a brilliant performance! Once you get into the movie, you simply can't take your eyes off him! Brando-style actor, never surprisingly much of his career in the movies. Although he gave splendid performances like the disastrous, disgraced cavalry officer in the exceptional Mann / Stewart western "Naked Spur" (1953) and as one of the condemned French soldiers sacrificed in the powerful WW1 drama "Paths of Glory" by Stanley Kubrick (1957 ) his only real claim to fame was Mike Hammer in "Kiss Me Deadly" by Mickey Spillane in 1955. His performance in "Jeopardy" should have worked wonders for him, but he only had such a brilliant career in movies . He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this version "Jeopardy" can now take the rightful place as a classic noir. A memorable, tense and exciting thriller thanks to the refined performances, the close direction of John Sturges, the clear Monochrome Cinematography by Victor Milner and the soundtrack by Dimitri Tiomkin. The extras, however, are not big jolts except for a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers for both films. <br /> <br /> This disc is also part of a box set by Barbara Stanwyck that celebrates its centenary. Hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - an MGM winner!
