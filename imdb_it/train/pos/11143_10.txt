I saw him as a naive young punk when he was released for the first time. I got sniffed like a child as I left the theater, trying not to show anyone. So when I saw him again now in '07, I knew what to expect and the sobs were ready and ready as their time came. Fortunately this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I had not remembered from my youthful vision - or perhaps I had not noticed because of this, was the technical genius of this film. The use of flashbacks that tell so many stories without resorting to dialogue. The camera work that seemed to place the viewer, along with the characters of the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to go to the restaurant, the camera opens behind the woman and the child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters - squalid, sad and brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama like this with people that most of us probably reject. Then again, Joe and Ratso could be some of us. It must have been in 1970 when I saw it. I remember coming out of the theater I was driven to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie.
