I have just finished listening to the director's comment for this film, and I think the only big thing that I have drawn is that this film, like Mann's The Insider, is completely subjective. It is taken from Howard's POV. So any review or attempt to contemplate a series of comments about it, as Ebert did, is really about the character of Nolte actually. If you hear, like he did, that the movie "doesn't work", then you're saying, I think, that Howard doesn't work. And to be honest, you might be right. Howard's reasoning and personality would actually not hold up to professional mental treatments and analyzes. <br /> <br /> But, hey, this is the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
