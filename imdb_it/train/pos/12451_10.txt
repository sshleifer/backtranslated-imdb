Even though I bought the DVD when it first came out, and I saw it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it when I saw it for the first time and still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that he never made enough money to motivate someone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill if he makes a film that is so faithful to comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another tough female protagonist, anyone who is not familiar with the character will see this as a delusion. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense than on action thrillers. <br /> <br /> The draft between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the starting material and is tense, full of suspense and fascinating for anyone who does not have to have blood and explosions. Alexandra did a great job in the way that O'Donnell's character would take control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this particularly ahead of the curve after the desperate restarts of Batman and James Bond. After two dismal previous efforts, though not so well known to the public, this is really a reboot of the Modesty character, and it's really sad that probably no more films will be made about her.
