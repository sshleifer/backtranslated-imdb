I just had a nice 45 minute ROLL rhythm. <br /> <br /> Roll is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who dreams of becoming a sports star. Mat travels around the city and must be collected by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat is dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great how Mat taught George a little moral and respect while George taught Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were wealthy and did an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> Each character in the film complimented each other very well, the two policemen were fantastic. David Ngoombujarra brought some comic relief to the film. Tiny played a nice gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite "Pando" characters from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things I liked about Roll is that it showed the cities where I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was nice to see places and landmarks I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
