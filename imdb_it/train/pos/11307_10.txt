To get in touch with the beauty of this film, pay close attention to the soundtrack, not just the music, but the way all the sounds help weave images. How beautifully the opening scene that leads to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! Notice the way the music introduces the characters as we are guided into Joanna's wedding. Don't expect to find much of Italian political life in 1943. That's not what this is about. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led into a word that goes beyond neorealism. At the end of the film there are moments in which Antonioni's landscape has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
