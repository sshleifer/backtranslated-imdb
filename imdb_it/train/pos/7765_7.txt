Douglas Sirk directs this drama over the poor well-off. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with a different aspect of life. Kyle is the feminizing son of an oil magnate; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it is Kyle who has the means to amaze and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) appears to be the nymphomaniac of the city and carries a torch for Mitch, who always seems to be the one who cleans Hadley's messes. Ambitious with a claim; a bit exaggerated, but the stars make it a movie to see. I was very impressed with Malone. To complete the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
