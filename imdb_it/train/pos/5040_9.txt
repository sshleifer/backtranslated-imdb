I saw the Frailty trailer on Yahoo Movies for the first time in the day after hearing Stephen King praise him in high sky. Not really a fan of either star, I still wanted to see him because I'm a big fan of the thriller. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The acting was superb, especially by the two young boys. I usually hate child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton has really done a good job of directing this too. It has been beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> Also note the twists. The three twists finally hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them coming. The last turning point in the film, combined with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though I've seen the film so many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
