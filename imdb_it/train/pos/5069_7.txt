The film is more about Pony than Gray Owl. They are also aborigines, Canada, British, Gray Owl aunts and North Bay Nugget. Excellent history. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, more like a book, which raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl who admits his imposture about Pony and his reaction. <br /> <br /> Some comments on user ratings. Note that user ratings are bipolar clustering at 5 and 7; it is not for everyone, but has a strong following. This film is undervalued and overlooked but will be noticed for years to come. Moreover, few women have seen the film, but they value it better than men. Has it been marketed correctly? <br /> <br />
