I know that, originally, this film was NOT a box office success, but in light of the recent Hollywood releases (most of which were decidedly based on the formula, less, useless, "save-the-blonde-chick" no matter what "drivel", Feast of All Saints, certainly in this sad context deserves a second opinion: the film - like the book - loses anchor in some historical backgrounds, but it represents a unique dilemma of America against the horrible institution American human slavery, and some of its tragic (and amusing and touching) consequences. <br /> <br /> And worthy of being identified is the very young Robert Ri'chard, played as the protagonist, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm it is truly universal, as he stated at the beginning of his "coming age", only to be cruelly disappointed by what appears to be his true education in the ways of the plantation world of southern Louisiana, at the height of antebellum iodo. When I saw the previews with the (feared) blonde-haired Ri'chard, I was expecting a buffoon, a fiasco, a caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, the end Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy lend vivid imagination and formidable skills as actors in the plagiarism scenario, voodoo, "Creole aristocracy" and revolt of Haiti woven into this story of human passion, hatred, love, family and racial perplexity in a society that has supposedly disappeared and yet somehow is still with us.
