It's always a nice surprise when a TV movie turns out to be as fun as Little Richard. This is a very watchable movie about the history of Rock and Roller, Little Richard played by an actor named Leon who I've never seen before but he does a great job. Like most TV movies, it's a bit more meek than if it were made for the Cinema, too bad because I'm sure there are a lot of things we saw on Little Richard that were controversial. Instead we see a lot of religious junk that is the only thing that ruins the film and eventually ruined a very promising career. All in all this film is good and the acting is above average for a TV movie. 7 out of 10.
