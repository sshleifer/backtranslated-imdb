Sitting on the porch of his home in Burbank, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore the exact same size in every piece of clothing except the hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the biggest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro put on his mask, it was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> It was a bit exaggerated: there were times that Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in the stunts we can be satisfied that he was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what stunts! "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is, as evidenced by the comments here, one of the largest serials. It is exciting and generally very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor and, as someone else commented, he did very well. <br /> <br /> But, I have to admit, it's the action that makes this movie so beautiful. <br /> <br /> And what else could we expect, with the direction of that excellent group, Witney and English, with the great music of the surprising prolific William Lava (the list here says he was not credited, but is it not correct, those other composers listed here really were not accredited, and I don't know if they wrote anything about the music - it sounds like Lava - and with the wickedness, among others, of the great Charles King, and with dozens of parts? <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is also a villain played by radio Tarzan, Jim Pierce, who was the son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read his mini-bio.) <br /> <br /> There is a chapter that slows things down in a depressing way, but heck, it's only a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you make it through, Well, you're back to excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a big THANK YOU for presenting this excellent serial, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank all those who had the impression of seeing it as a game of chapter, or series, and not as a clipping function.
