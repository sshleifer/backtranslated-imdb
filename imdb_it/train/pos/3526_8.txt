Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a bad fight and split with his wife, seems to drown his pains in the local watering hole. There he discovers a woman in a similar emotional state and, in search of company, asks her to perform in a club to free her mind from their problems. You agree, but only on condition that they keep their names for themselves. Sure enough, when Scott returns home, he finds the police there, waiting to question him. His wife was murdered. Where were you at 8 this evening, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he does not know the woman's name. And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman. Not even the taxi driver. Nor the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club. Even the club dancer, whom Scott clearly saw the woman (both wore the same hat), will not recognize that there was someone with him. Something is happening, but whatever it is, Scott is unable to defend himself from a trial and is sentenced to death for the murder of his wife (on the "weakest" evidence in Hollywood's judicial history). He is left to his faithful secretary, "Kansas" (Ella Raines), who later joins a nice inspector Burgess, to find out the real murderer before Scott is executed. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is built on themes that recur, almost compulsively, in Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. Also, there is the character who becomes mentally upset by the death of a boyfriend or consort as found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. He can let the viewer feel as if he were treading on a worn ground. But in the right hands, the feverish plots, the displeased dialogues, the narrative incongruities, are all at the limit. Fortunately, Phantom Lady was guided by sound hands. <br /> <br /> This is the first Siodmak noir. He would continue to stand out as one of, if not the, preeminent style practitioners (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here it is fortuitously coupled with the director of photography Woody Bredell (they would have reunited with Christmas Holiday and The Killers). There is some great storytelling done in the camera. In one shot, a character's deteriorating mental state is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror, suggesting more personality. The same character, who is an artist, has the self-portrait of Van Gogh with his bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look for the noir. Released very early in 1944, that's all; the wet pavement, the bags of atmosphere and terror, the strongly contrasting b & w, the wildly expressionistic versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), the discordant beams of light, etc. It's a terrific photo to watch. /> <br /> Franchot Tone aside, the cast, as well as the argument and the relative inexperience of the director (and presumably, the budget), suggests cinematographic ambitions of "B". I thought Tone was a little bitter. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not up to par, and actually looks rather weak in some scenes. Ella Raines is mainly good (and very beautiful). His "sex scene" with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delusional that it must be seen to be believed. Another glaring scene is when Kansas searches for the bartender to question him. It is a chase scene, while she chases him relentlessly through the streets, with a stop at a subway station. Some real tension in here. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4
