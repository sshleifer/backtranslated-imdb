This is a real eye candy. A world made of floating islands and ancient flying cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is to cast cathedrals against their opponents ... Who can resist them? An ancient prophecy, a group of lost heroes and a nice princess in search of her hero ... seems familiar ...? Yes, we've already heard that song. But you will forget it while observing spectacular landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you'll want a little more history. <br /> <br /> What's behind the 30-year circle? What made the rider mad? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart? And apart from this group of peasants, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it's not the Lord of the Rings.
