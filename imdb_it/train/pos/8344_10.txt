This is one of my all-time favorites. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a romantic chick comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and this is true ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters "You're thinking about what I'm thinking" and Ed says "Now what are the chances of that happening! " In my opinion, a movie is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and enjoy the same amount of fun, and with that, you can !! I also loved Walter M.s' way of portraying Einstein. I think all the characters fit together really well and the story runs well. There are so many times that I find myself smiling along with the film and mentioning my favorite phrases while watching it! I would recommend this film to anyone with a heart and enjoy a romantic wellness comedy from time to time!
