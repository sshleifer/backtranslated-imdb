I was very moved when I saw the film. As Jonny could keep that hope and faith was incredible. so many people only care about what they want and care about all the things they don't have. and these things are so small, like the chothes, the money a new car. I saw people crying because of a fault. this movie brings everything back to basics. love, I hope that the beauty of simple but important things in vita.it makes our daily problems seen for what they are Small and really unimportant. you look at this boy and you realize until you've been blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you. You are truly blessed. And the saying stop and smell the roses really has a new meaning. know that Jonny will see it and I want to thank him so much for having shared this faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you, Jonon, I know you save the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the skies above.
