This film is a journey into the mind of a screenwriter captured in his paradoxical philosophy. Examine the always illusory question of "who am I" and "what am I?" It is a courageous and stimulating undertaking. There is a load of beautiful images, paradoxical inspired by dreams, similar to Escher who remember the hand that is drawn, or rather, it is erased. More and more we follow the writer in his agony about what to say and what to film, we see him calling with his wife who left for Peru, leaving him to take care of their child, a task that he carries out with less and less attention until he is so absorbed in his dilemma not to look at the child anymore. His wife returns and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him to overcome the last threshold until he cancels himself. Exchanged with pleasant and destructive images, the story is mainly philosophical. These are the veils of Maya, the world of illusion. The paradox of the film, however, is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to show that thought should stop. During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophization, the film made me want silence or a shorter film. If this was the purpose of the producer, he succeeded quite well.
