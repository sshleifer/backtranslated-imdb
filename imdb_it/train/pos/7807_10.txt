The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) is extraordinarily NATURAL which is what cinematographic acting should be; and the directing ability is managed so brilliantly on every detail that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I'm rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors, Attenborough credits that leave me perplexed: aren't they proud to say that they made such an excellent and long-lasting film for the public? I hope to get some answers to my puzzles from someone (perhaps one of the "knowledgeable" personal (insiders) of the film.
