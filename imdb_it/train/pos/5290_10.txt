Going for something very far from the deliberately vulgar things he usually does, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) He made this parody of the celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, she offers him his big chance, which he accepts. But once he hits it big, he has to reconsider everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life when he becomes a celebrity. The kind of things we might expect, of course, but with Waters directing, there are always some things that shock us (you'll know them when you see them). I would definitely recommend it. He also played Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
