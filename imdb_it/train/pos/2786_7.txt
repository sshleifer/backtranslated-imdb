What surprised me most about this film was the pure audience that attracted. Similar films like Anita and Me have never caused as much fuss as this film, although I think it's probably due to the mention of "Beckham" in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant film that conveys a brilliant message - you can do anything if you are determined enough, and focus on it, which is such a positive message for anyone watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the best films of Keira Knightley, and I think she is a brilliant actress, and she was excellent for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can't say this for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I don't think he was a great actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary. <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant film and a brilliant story
