It's hard to say what the result, the charm and the energy of James Cagney or the excesses that open the mouth of Busby Berkeley's three big show-stops at the end. I read it, with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and fastest musicals of the early thirties. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell immeasurably adds the storyline of good-natured history. <br /> <br /> And what is the plot? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney), which produces musicals, and which is now almost out of the market while talkies take over. Start doing Prologues, live music entertainment offered on stage before the start of a film. He has the idea of ​​making them bigger and more, moving them all over the country. It is a ball of fire and ideas, and it needs all the ideas it can get to keep producing these things relentlessly. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise secretary, loves him, but is too busy even to notice; an office girl in round glasses with black frames (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife shows up saying he hasn't divorced her after all; a blond gold digger is putting his hooks in him; his partners are cheating him ... my god, what's next? All this may seem like a lot to swallow, but everything happens quickly, with Cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, snapping his fingers, barking orders and every now and then - until the last number when everything goes to sing and dance - take a step or two just to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's show off, band" we have "We need to build three shows in three days, so close the doors and start trying." These three super-prologues will present 40 choristers, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent units in luxurious movie houses ... the entire Apollo cinema circuit! The fatigue threatens, the pain in the feet, but all those unfilled singers in skimpy costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic) remain the course, dancing their hearts, giggling and chatting and looking remarkably numb. <br /> <br /> And then the curtains rise as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after the other on the same night, with the owner of the Apollo circuit that will determine that night if it will save Chester's skin or no. <br /> <br /> The first is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9-minute production number that presents a lot of healthy lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some may even be married), bedrooms and beds and doors with "Do not disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> Then to the next theater and 11 minutes of "By a Waterfall" which probably had Warner Brothers accountants worried about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive - dozens of girls swimming, trees, fountains, a huge cave with water slides, a gigantic pool - you would never think there was a depression. Berkeley brings out all his tricks - synchronization, human models, legs and arms that do all sorts of precision things - and he does it in the water, with lots of underwater photographs looking up. The girls are sure of the game. They arrive smiling with water in their eyes and continue to hit their signs. Everything must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a few quick shots in the water, is the only one who seems a little cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, the great finale ... 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler at "Shanghai Lil", with all kinds of girls bars and their customers, unusual in the fact that the races they are confused. There's Cagney and Keeler dancing at the bar, dancing on a table, fighting Cagney. There are those that look like fifty or sixty marines on the march, moving back and forth, shotguns thrown and captured. So ... this is true ... a form of human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the eagle of the NRA. This could be the only Hollywood music production I've ever seen Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a group of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment, folks. It's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's Prologues get the big deal and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so captivating that she tired the faucets with flying arms to help her for a long time. Joan Blondell makes us forget many Hollywood women who may have been more beautiful but who had much less spirit and personality. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who grabs it and shakes it, and Berkeley, a man for whom it has never been too much.
