I must say that I was struck by the fact that the cinematography was surprising, the frames close to perfection and the way in which he built the tension around a subject that seems more terrible boredom is beyond all limits. <br /> <br /> The film is about two storytellers, one seen, one not seen. Both are trying to explain the meaning of a series of paintings that caused a scandal long ago. The film is about theories and explanations of opinions, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. Definitely a film that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes of time to interpret the plot, the film still seemed a complete job. Fantastic direction! I have to say a lot better than Poet's Blood which, for some strange reason, reminds me a little. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call him with the word "artsy" slang. It's just a lot of professional speeches on various theories and amazing visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz took it out. At least for me. A fantastic film.
