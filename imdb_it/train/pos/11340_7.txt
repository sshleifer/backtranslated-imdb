Every child experiences a growing trauma and each child's active imagination has got the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco of the upcoming Clint Eastwood CHANGELING film - which resembles Henry Thomas in 1982) the combination could prove deadly . <br /> <br /> A lonely six-year-old whose imagination takes over when he is mortified to learn his quarreling parents Peter (Sean Bridgers, late for "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS: Miami ") suddenly decides to divorce, leaving him to himself and unleashing a new tenant ?? a zombie in his closet. <br /> <br /> Jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon (Matthew Josten) who gives him an internet print of FAQ on: zombies. Is Jake so convinced that one is out to get it ?? and his family ?? start to open an action plan to protect them before it's too late. <br /> <br /> The Indian newcomer Shelli Ryan ?? who wrote and directed ?? fuses domestic drama with horror underlings but the first (elegantly) exceeds the latter, with a decent story backed by fine acting (De Marco is the rare breed of child actor in which he is a CHILD and does not "play" - all of his nuances are very obvious of the clumsy, shy, introverted child that many can also report to them (I certainly can) Bridgers makes her husband a cheating empath in realizing that he really loves his son while Bloom has the most difficult task of creating sympathy like his mother a a little needy, those who are quick to emotion compared to rationality do not help when Dillon Ruth's mother (Monette Magrath, who looks like Laura Dern) constantly feeds her implicit information by driving a wedge between Jake and her father. difficult to do, his manipulative character is relatively nice but shows in a revealing scene that I won't go into details, but I'll show why this is so as he is (and, above all, how he influenced his son). <br /> <br/> Even the subjective camera of Fillmmaker is well used (many angles shown form Jake's point of view at waist level or slightly tilted; that is, Peter's upside-down shot that takes his son to the same position while have a little fun in the backyard), and the installation is relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan based the script on personal experiences growing and also witnessing the first-hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affections of adult relationships can be harmful if they inflict their fears , anger and stress their children. Here the film is very successful in transmitting its theme. <br /> <br /> However the basics of horror are a bit bumpy to say the least, but the tribute to George A. Romero's zombie movies is lovingly shown by Ryan (Jake's mom is asleep in front on TV as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEATHS, causing their own belief in the undead to be at home). The metaphor of a monster that acts as a substitute for domestic abuse can be a bit heavy, but again, the child's fear of something under his bed is universal.
