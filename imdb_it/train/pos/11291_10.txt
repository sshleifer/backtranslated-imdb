Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a pilot from Real (not Reel) who saw himself throwing his wings in the air and then tearing them with his fist while his pilot's wings were being assigned. <br /> <br /> Only a few seconds on the screen, but my family would like to have the movie. He was killed in a dogfight in Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it? <br /> <br /> Or has someone seen it in a video store, like Blockbuster? I hope they can make entire catalogs of these old films available as it is so cheap to make DVDs these days. <br /> <br /> Email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
