One of those wonderfully intense films that attracts us so intimately in there, it ends very soon! Then they stood and looked at the screen like "No, they didn't!", Lol. Good performance in everything! The acting is wonderful with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew he would give a solid and convincing performance by capturing young Victoria's royalty, anger and vulnerability through the entire movie. Furthermore, the production is exceptional from every point of view: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse into an extraordinary moment in the history of Brittany told through a very personal and moving biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen, later marrying Prince Albert, which ended with the birth of their first of nine sons. He had a well-written script and impeccable editing. Rupert Friend, the young prince Albert, always patient and compassionate, who competed to win the attention of the young queen, to ensure his love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) pledged to watch. Equally compelling was the relationship between the teenager Victoria and her mother, who at times was fury, as with her mother and King William (who disliked her mother). The acting and the scenes were captivating, very exciting. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing at that time and, indeed, to anyone who loves a truly compelling love story
