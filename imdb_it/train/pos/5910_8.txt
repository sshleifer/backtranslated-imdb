OK, OK, don't bend. I was joking. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and truer title. <br /> <br /> Racism and criminal dramas receive the satirical treatment desired by our animating friend X-rated Ralphie, boy. And he does one of his best works here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front it shows the truth. They build it, defend it, then boredom and stronger rivals make them (maybe) lose. See for yourself to see what goes down. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. With Scatman (RIP) and the loving walrus (also RIP) which are black and the main point of view, I saw it primarily as an attack on racism. Richard Pryor's liking for it says it just as well. And the youngest (pre "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> It is an animated film of "Blacksploitation". It's a good thing. Done well and well done It will make some contortions (like the lynching scene) but unfortunately it is based on the fact. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie REALLY should have rethought that title.
