Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code movie. It involves realistic events with really funny and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He makes his living by doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. One night he meets Trina, a beauty of any level who is cold and alone. She refused to resort to prostitution, so she didn't eat for several days, but the two take each other very well and form a relationship. His free spirit drives him to leave her, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between the two, even though they live in a shack near the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. His characters are fantastic and recognizable. We can see his thoughts on his face, making it easily identifiable, even though we believe he is behaving badly. Young is great in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, making her much more likeable. <br /> <br /> Pre-coded elements include lean immersion, pre-marital pregnancy and crime.
