I want to add praise for the production of this film, in particular luminous cinematography. The light of the fire that glitters on smooth and muscular skin creates extraordinarily beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar - the first entry for editing. Mala's performance is moody, penetrating and powerful.
