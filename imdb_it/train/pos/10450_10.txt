It was by chance that I was scanning TV channels and I found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who attract each other in a very innocent and virgin way how to approach each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV Series (Nicole). This boy and girl will warm your heart and soul and make you reflect deeply in your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed the strings of your heart with a boy or a girl deep in years. Jesse and Celine have a great conversation and profound eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them. I can't wait for SEQUEL to start for this film in 2004 and if you've seen this movie, you'll feel the same way.
