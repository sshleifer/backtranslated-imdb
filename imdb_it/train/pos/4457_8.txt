Yes, this is one of the great musical films I grew up with so amusing characters like Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention Kathryn Grayson's small and glorious voice. Music and dancing are superb. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique at the time. Betty Garrett plays the maid who falls in love with Sinatra. It is one of the great underrated stars of Hollywood. I saw it again on A & E TV and I also had it in my old VCRs. Never tire of these old musicals. Whatever happened to Hollywood ??
