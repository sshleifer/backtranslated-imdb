Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. Written wisely and perfectly delivered, this burning parody of students and teachers of a public school in South London literally leaves you in a state of exhaustion. It is vulgar, provocative, witty and acute. The characters are a superbly caricatured cross-section of British society (or to be more precise, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for lack of a better term, the show does not avoid parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out of the window in every episode. If you like shows that are not afraid to make fun of every conceivable taboo subject, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
