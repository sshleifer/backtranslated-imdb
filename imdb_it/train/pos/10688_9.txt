I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see the movie, apart from the slightly surreal basic plot that a lone man orders from a Russian bride on the internet. This was Nicole Kidman. I still loved the film, and I came out thinking "wow". <br /> <br /> As refreshing as it may be, the film moves well, with some surprises at every corner. The relationships in the film are credible, with Nicole and Chaplin working against each other beautifully. The humor is subtle, with some great "Office" style scenes in the bank, and the thriller element adds tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation. It is less about heroism and more about delicate relationships. The British film at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
