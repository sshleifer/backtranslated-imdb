In response to the person who commented on how the film drags on and who believed that there was no purpose for Jess's brother's role here is my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of the brother of Jess is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have predicted the problems associated with living life to the full by looking at how Jess's brother turned out to be. There are several cases where Brad Pitt and his lives run in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and later finds Brad Pitt a few days later. The dramatic irony was there, so the character of Craig Sheffer would have had a greater emotional turmoil at the death of his brothers, knowing he could do more to prevent it and later create a more convincing mood in the film.
