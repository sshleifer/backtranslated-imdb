This is not an art house movie, it is mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lot of beautiful people, t & a, and action. I found it very funny. It shouldn't be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also fun, which is just a pleasure. Definitely worth a rent. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I suggest you take a look at it for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even with your girlfriend (if you like to see the other girls do it!) > <br /> Even the bad guys are good. Vinnie, Corey Large, the boy hatiano of Heroes. Very bad villains.
