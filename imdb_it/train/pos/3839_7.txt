Most people know Paul Verhoeven as a director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But much earlier he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land. History is a basic premise of femme fatale, nothing new or compelling. Verhoeven thinks he can do better by adding a series of dream sequences, which instead of defining our main character and his situation, are used only as a way to carry forward the predictable plot. The script was solid, the dialogue helped to fill the effects of the bland story. What really made the film at least good was some fantastic acting. Jereon Krabbe was extraordinary as a "tortured artist" and even the supporters were very good. In addition, Jan De Bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film, helping to make Verhoeven look at least as capable as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
