If you were born at the time this film was finished, and I had a liberal / open family I had, I am sure that during the early 1980s you would have introduced yourself for the first time to walk on your parents watching dirty or dirty films . You know, not 100% pornographic material, but rather an alchemical mix of drama and pornography, or that you sneak into their collection and you were part of the rectangular plastic representation of a movie like that in a big dookie machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet and like a ninja, but still suffer from heart failure when huge pop noises were made by pressing tablet-like buttons for fear of being caught. In any case, these films have been sent to the back of your mind, waiting and waiting to be reunited with this visual "art". Needless to say, this film falls under the description above in a "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps because of my lack of sensitivity, I am more disturbed by the subtleties. The creator spoke to us at deeper levels of human carnality or what could be considered a true abomination, interracial relationships, masturbation of the bed, voyeurism, or could be the despair of the welfare state until murder, pedophilia / all homosexuality, or the repressed sexual nature of socially elite women in 18th-century France? Who can say, but despite the taste of Mr. Borowcyzk for the vivid and raw sexuality of being the "norm" for his works, I would say that indeed this film speaks to the viewer on a deeper level of the bestial carnality. Once I learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the vertigo of shock value and therefore, it is worth a try.
