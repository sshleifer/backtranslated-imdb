I saw a couple of movies about eating disorders, but this was definitely my favorite. The problem with others is that people with eating disorders towards the end automatically become better or accept the fact that they need help and that's it. this movie I thought it was more realistic because in this the main character Lexi doesn't improve automatically. She improves and then has an inconvenience. I think this movie shows more than the others that I've seen that improving is not just one thing, it's hard work and time-consuming, it's a long journey of recovery. I think this movie shows all this very well. There should be more films like this.
