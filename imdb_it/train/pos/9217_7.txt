This really funny movie has a crazy cast of characters, almost all the voluptuous middle-aged Hollywood women and a touching and funny love story. Capomezza and Malacici are rival restaurateurs in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also opposites - extremes - ends of the taste scale. Their children are expressed in the main roles of an ecclesiastical production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On stage! The chaos and confusion that this causes, while parents challenge each other and their children, is played for us against the backdrop of the beautifully insipid house of Capomezza and their wonderfully tasteless marriages. <br /> <br /> the four over-the-top parents and the charming young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a clear-talking grandmother, a woman waving a wand and transmitting the spiritual advice she receives from a medium called The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds in the shape of a back seat for a car and two doves. There is no gag sight or a joke that does not click in this hectic movie. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low-brows," and "Malacici" could mean "perched snobs". <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this film. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you might not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
