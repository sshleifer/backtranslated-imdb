I'd even say a few nuances about Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not Woody fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was initially conceived as a mystery of murder? In any case, Woody recovers a certain relevance in the cinematographic comedy with this. The curves of the plot are beautiful and narrow. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some actors are a little too hasty in delivering their lines, but they remain attached. Scarlett Johansson demonstrates her role in the role of Diane Keaton, and at no time are there unpleasant moments between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Jackman's Peter Lyman.
