Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre for themselves. Among the most important we have "Officer and Gentleman", "Top Gun", "GI Jane" and now "Men of Honor". The fact that this has happened does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This film is probably more like "GI Jane" because it focuses on the angle of desegregation. <br /> <br /> The story is actually quite inspiring and is probably the best human interest story mentioned above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines brilliantly in this film. Unfortunately, the director George Tillman has a tunnel vision in presenting the characters and avoids the development of the character of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and except for the opening scene, the fist fight and a couple of scenes with his wife, we don't know much about him. For example, Brashear sees the scars on his palms on Sunday and we must assume that he worked on a plow, but on this point there is no following. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) only gets a short scene with which we can judge him. The rest of the time on the screen shows him walking up and down. If a director is going to make a story of human interest, he needs to humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. offers an exceptional performance like Brashear. This is probably the best I've seen. This is a role and a character that is much more complete than any other part I've ever played before, and is up to the task. In "Jerry Maguire", Rod Tidwell was a fascinating character, but one-dimensional with the depth of a puddle of rain. Brashear is much more complex and rooted, and the issues it faces are the crises of life, making the part much more challenging. This is an excellent shot from Gooding's last role in "Chill Factor", a film so terrible that it was almost a professional suicide to take its part. <br /> <br /> After a period in which he tried his hand as a comedian ("Analyze this", "The adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle", "Meet the parents"), Robert De Niro is back to his roots dramatic with an exceptional performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he is such a big dramatic actor that he doesn't seem to waste his time making comedies. DeNiro gives Billy Sunday a rock hard personality who belies a tortured soul. It is a pleasure to watch him work. <br /> <br /> It seems that every movie I watch lately has Charlize Theron inside it. I saw "The Legend of Bagger Vance", "Men of Honor" and "The Yards" below and I was starting to wonder if he had a part in every movie in 2000 (actually, he only made five). This was a minor role for Theron, but he did well, managing to stay with DeNiro step by step. David Keith, co-star with Richard Gere in "Officer and a Gentleman", has a cameo here <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting special features, including the reflections of the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I liked this film despite the trivial plot and one-dimensional presentation. I rated it 7/10. I suck for the losers' stories and I have a passion for stories where the strength of character is the central theme. This film is particularly strong in both areas and gives us two memorable recitations that offset some of the director's shortcomings.
