'Iphigenia' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterful game is masterfully adapted to the screen and animated by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis has achieved the impossible. He managed to film a Greek tragedy on the screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. A stellar Greek cast helps him with this. The newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who although sometimes seems exaggerated, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent soundtrack by Mikis Theodorakis which is ideal in every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say that the film has lost the best foreign-language film Oscar with only 1 vote !!!
