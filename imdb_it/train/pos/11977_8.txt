OK. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During his run he became a phenomenon. Anorexic twins became popular. Bob Saget started making a salary (instead of his REALLY fun stand). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was fun and he always brought home a good lesson. And that's where it sets me apart from the norm: I liked the last few seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children get older there are many more things you can do with the script. That is why I dare say ... He could have gone much later than he was. But anyway. I gave him an 8/10 because of his healthy and fun story lines, and thanks to Bob Saget!
