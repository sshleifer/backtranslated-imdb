"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment on the film. What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> This character brings out the idiot in Moronie. A tough gangster with the inability to utter profane words, well, it seems like it would have been frustrating to be hard and not able to express yourself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will enter the annals of film history as one of the greatest morons. <br /> <br /> There is obviously a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moronie kept the film from an "R" rating because he couldn't pronounce swear words.
