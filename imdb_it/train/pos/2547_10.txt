We do not enjoy this gem, the invisible ray of 1936, often. But nobody can forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, austere and embittered in his Carpathian mountain retreat, is Janos Rukh, a brilliant science that reads ancient rays of light to ascertain events in the great geological past, in particular the crash of a powerful radioactive meteor in Africa. Joining him is the always elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry". Frances Drake is the young and lovely underutilized wife; Frank Lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a show worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly in daring episodes, with special effects that are still beautiful. It also contains some wonderful lines. A Rukh restores the sight of his mother, asks, "Mother, see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever and what I see scares me." Even better when mother Rukh says: "He broke the first law of science". I am not the only one who knows me who has confused for many years exactly what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely desert island material.
