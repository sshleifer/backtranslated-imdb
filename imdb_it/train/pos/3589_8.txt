I liked this movie and, after looking at it, it made me think about how many "Caitlin Roses" exist in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this type of sexual abuse and torment by classmates and have been too scared to open their mouths about it? How threatening and cruel can adolescents be towards each other, because as this film demonstrates, those who are right are not the most important, those who are popular and feared who manipulate the minds of young people and influence them to allow this guy of immorality happening .Tiffans Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as a victim of rape, and Brian Austin Green is as convincing as the guy split between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. This is the kind of film that does not get the exposure it deserves. It's interesting, and brilliant, too good to be just a TV movie.
