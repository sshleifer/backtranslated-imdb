Clint Eastwood resumes his role as Dirty Harry, which this time is the case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) who is killing many of those who raped her and her sister at a carnival. Eastwood makes his role and the film is mostly more about action so he talks, not that I'm complaining. Suddenly Impact is really fun entertainment.
