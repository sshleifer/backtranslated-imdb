I love this film and it is a wonderful example of an endangered family, a romantic love story and a very sad story. Everything was perfect and excellent for this film. It was such a great mix of actors and actresses and with a few laughs and lots of shouts this movie deserves to receive many awards. With the mention of a beautiful scenery, and even if I would have told this movie to The Notebook and The Family Stone, he was much smarter, sad and brilliant than those movies. The Evening tells of a love story between an old woman who returns to her childhood and her two daughters stand by her side while she is not well. The dating story is so strongly told and wonderful I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really met all the characters and in the end, I wanted to watch it again. This is an incredibly sad and vividly recited and dashed film that is truly one of a kind and should be seen by everyone for how wonderful it is. All the performances are amazing and the film catches your attention from the beginning and never gives up. I loved it and I'm so glad I saw it because it was really an amazing movie ...
