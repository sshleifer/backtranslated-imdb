This, along with "Hare Tonic", ranks as one of the best cartoons of Bugs, in fact one of the best Bugs ever. There are some comments on how the bugs in these cartoons are "basic", meaning, I believe, that it is not yet fully developed. I actually prefer this "base" version of the mid-1940s (Chuck Jones was the best version) which is actually bigger as a rabbit and a lot more fun than the long-leg version that towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. Insects of the last few days have become too sweet and sophisticated for my taste. Discover also "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of classic bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
