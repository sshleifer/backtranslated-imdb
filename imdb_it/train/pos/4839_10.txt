a timeless classic, wonderfully performed with perfect settings, which evokes a wonderful atmospheric film. a simple story mixed with humor and suspense. I would like a video to be available in the UK. I've seen this movie on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter.
