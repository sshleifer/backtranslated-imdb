Director Sam Fuller has a cult following, particularly in Europe. Yet most of his films are more than forgettable. However, he directed a truly exceptional film in "Pickup on South Street". Made very early in his career, the films that followed were far inferior. <br /> <br /> From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" works on all levels. It is shot with impeccable fluidity, with excellent all-round performance. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both with a good reputation for first-class performance, are at their peak. Widmark, who was no stranger to playing the villains, while he is really petty in the core, still manages to reveal the slightest humanity that makes his character fascinating and makes Jean Peters' character even more believable. <br /> Fuller has no punches in this really tough movie. There is a scene where Jean Peters is beaten by Widmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography. <br /> <br /> Less aware of many noir films of the period, this remains a great example of the genre.
