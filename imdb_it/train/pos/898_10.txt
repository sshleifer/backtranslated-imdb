You really should be very tired not to be overwhelmed by this jewel of a movie (and I've also seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). The actors, the wonderful settings, the settings and settings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the singer voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was just lovely. Even the human element (imperfect) has been intertwined, to create a bit of drama and guide the plot, as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution. Alok Nath is such an exceptional actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he plays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves real novels - those that go beyond superficial beauty to true love - as one of the best movies out there, in Hindi or otherwise!
