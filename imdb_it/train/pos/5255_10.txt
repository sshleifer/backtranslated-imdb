Tim Meadows must be the most underrated among the SNL cast members. What initially was a low-pitched look at a bad squeak develops into a 90-minute run that is completely enjoyable, even if it's still low. Don't jump at this waiting for a nice photograph or an Oscar-worthy performance. Enter the scene expecting brilliant nonsense with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best - making the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Ladies' Man" Phelps is a naive, likeable radio host who knows that very little of everything except the ways of the wang. Like a gifted gentleman, he wastes the wives of innumerable scholars who have joined together to hunt him down. The director does an inspired job of guiding the actors into a comedy that completely compensates for the lack of plot development. How much plot would you expect from a SNL scene? While some scenes are a bit inaccurate, for the most part, the sentences of a single head and absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone exactly. For example, in one scene, Meadows confronts Mother Teresa, but by merit. Of course it's rough, but not all of us, in the privacy of our homes, giggle from his advice to an entire city to "make it in the ass"? In another scene, immediately after a sincere kiss with the female protagonist, he suddenly remembers that his name would have been a benefactor, a woman he had slept with years ago. He stands up in front of the woman who is obviously in love with him and proclaims that "The Ladies' Man is back", with his obvious displeasure. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball outside the park while a bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, the repressed homosexual, completes his solid performances. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you like adult humor. Otherwise, stay away with extreme prejudices.
