I liked it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci-Fi / Fantasie. And the dinosaur mania. I read for pleasure, but when I feel too stressed or really crazy, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed me to do this. This makes it a success in my eyes! I didn't even leave to do something else while he was running. Whether it was evaluated as "good" or not, I don't really care. And no, I'm not a young man. Nor am I a moron.
