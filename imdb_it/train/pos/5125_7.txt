I swelled up to the bar expecting it to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering from "Saturday Night Foolishness" I had no desire to see a remake in some courtyard in South Texas ... and I didn't. John Revolta was as good as the jealous redneck, Scott Glenn was well cast as an ex-con, and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight. * Love that woman * Also, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy who can't stand the sound of country music]. A funny movie to the end.
