Children - of any age - do not want to know about their parents' sex life. And adult children are often seriously baffled and baffled by the evidence that elderly parents have an active libido. Finally, many viewers are very uncomfortable looking at a sloppy widow who would go unnoticed almost everywhere will discover her indolent ability and the need for pure passion with a handsome man half her age. <br /> <br /> "The mother" is a provocative look at a poorly filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, watch "television" and vegetate after her husband of almost thirty years, and a dominant and dominant type, who packs it with a huge heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in her own way. The male child lives with a beautiful wife who could lead him to the Bankruptcy Court with his extravagant business venture. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw), is a teacher with successful aspirations as a writer. She is attractive, not pretty, and seems to have an intimate relationship with mom - at first. <br /> <br /> Back at his home after burying her husband, May decides not to stay there. Rejecting the typical widowhood with her legacy of boring and adventurous days, she goes to stay with Paula who has a small child. Paula's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig) is a robust and handsome entrepreneur who seems to have taken a terribly long time to complete an addition to May's son's home. May is quite taken by Darren, who drinks with cocaine, whose treatment of Paula should have alerted May that he was, of course, a member of the Royal Academy of Cads. <br /> <br /> What follows is a torrid story between Darren and the infatuated and now stormy widow (dare I say rebirth?). The love scenes are graphic but are placed in the background between the amateur artists of May and the pen sketches of their meetings which then play a role in the gripping drama (or debacle, make your choice). <br /> <br /> The Manhattan theater It was packed for the early afternoon of today and showed more than half of the audience in the May age group. Whether someone was shocked or upset to see that she herself abandoned herself to erotic abandonment in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement. <br /> <br /> This blinding and sincere look at the awakened passion of an old woman after decades obediently obeyed her husband's desire to stay home and raise children (she also says that he did not like having friends ... that boy) faces a series of problems. While May's flirting with Darren does not constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions and problems, with a mother nursing her daughter's lover. And Paula is not made of the most serious things to begin with. The deal, once disclosed, allows the open peeling of the mother-daughter relationship which, from Paula's point of view, left something to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support and love: she hasn't been given a terrible hand by life, but it's not even a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> May is strong in her resolve to recognize her sexuality and expect, indeed, to demand a future of happiness. But it is also inevitably vulnerable. He is fishing in uncharted waters. Who controls his relationship with Darren and why they are difficult problems to understand for her, and much less determination. At sixty, it is still under development. <br /> <br /> "Something's Gotta Give" recently showed mature sexuality, but in an amusing and antiseptic way, ensuring that no viewer would be baffled. After all, it is Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton who does somersaults in the world of the rich. And to ensure that serious psychosocial issues have not been explored, Keaton's young girlfriend, Amanda Peet, daughter of Keaton, not only blesses the game, but ensures that the public knows that she and her old (er) aspiring lover don't jump never in the bag. <br /> <br /> It's not easy here. Anne Reid's inspired performance forces discomfort to arouse respect in others. His naked body breaks through with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction for others (the comments of the members of the public who leave today reflect all these points of view). Congratulations to director Roger Michell for dealing with a fascinating story with verve and empathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
