Comparable to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I, Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way never done before. The first 30 minutes build an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the film is, well, confused, you will choose more every time you look at it (I went to the cinema to see it 3 times)
