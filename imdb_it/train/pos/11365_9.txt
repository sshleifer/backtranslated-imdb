Ok, let's start by saying that this film is not an exact representation of the crimes and legal research of Andrei Chikatilo. Although in the Politburo it may have been an "official policy" that the Soviet Union had no serial killer, in reality the legal system had handled others, and "Killer X" (as it was actually called) had already been searched when Fetisov brought Burakov in the case. In fact, as soon as he realized he had multiple murders on their hands, the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the murderous madness of a man who did not fit what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters. It's nice that the director and screenwriters constantly remind the viewer that the story is only "based on real events", for a docudrama that is not so. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> Having said that, this is a damn example of a fast-paced Hollywood thriller that still crosses the bases of what happened . It's easy to follow and has enough truth behind its version of events to make the vision compelling. Yes, Chikatilo raped and killed both children and adults, both boys and girls. Yes, cheap lab work has made him free to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men have been accused of murders and "confessed" to their crimes that the police solicit. Yes, the gay community was harassed while crimes were committed (albeit with the assistance of Burakov). And yes, Chikatilo was led to confession not by the plea of ​​the special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but by the delicate understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunov was not at all close to the selfish martinet portrayed in this film). Regardless of truth and truthfulness, all these events are dramatized in a way that constantly tightens tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt the director and co-writer Chris Gerolmo has a perfect cast. The growing emotional involvement of Stephen Rea in the murders and the development of skills in detecting the clues, the lean manipulation of Donald Sutherland of the Soviet party's hacks and the thin spine that becomes evident when necessary, the seething Jeffrey DeMunn's rage hidden by an attitude full of fear, Max Von Sydow's childlike excitement to be part of a criminal investigation improves clear dialogue and clear editing in ways that cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Taken for what it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect (the "almost" due to a moment of complacency in the end that doesn't really fit). Highly recommended as a well-told fiction, not being presented a fact ... but considering the "serial killer" movies that usually come out of Hollywood, it's good enough for me.
