Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real "Miike" movie and I thought this sort of description could be a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on truth. All the Miike brands are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo tests and the central character difficult to love. Shinjuku is still one of Miike's most perfect films. He says in an interview that if he did it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film has a really captivating energy and a raw edge that looks so fresh that, although it might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex film, it could not replicate or improve the purity of this movie. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, the violence is completely visceral, the gushing blood and the violent beatings are completed by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a wrecked chair on her face. (Only a film by Miike could make you miss a phrase like that.) The film has a fantastic rhythm, unlike Dead or Alive that starts and ends with force and plunges into the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar problems, Miike is clearly worried about relations between the Japanese and the Chinese in the post-war period and this emotional theme is well managed here, the central character who really comes to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can't sing enough Shinjuku praise. I don't want to give too much. This is Miike before he started using CGI to animate his films and almost remembers something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are superbly crafted and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film is finished, I will resume it again to solve it.
