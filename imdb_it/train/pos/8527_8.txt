Allow me to come to the conclusion: I have 3 children, ages 5 to 10. I consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals. I have seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film turns upside down in The Wizard of Oz, the sexual joke over 18 in El Dorado and the tragic defect with the end of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. I could probably do the Nemo storyboard from memory only. <br /> <br /> What makes me support my only (varied) son who suggests this title for an evening's family movie? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
