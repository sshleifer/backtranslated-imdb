The whole film deserves to be seen only for the magnificent final moment - it's the best ending of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, fun, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this film delightful, even if it's the thing the Frenchman is taking in itself by taking it too seriously. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians were intertwined - and anyway, the music during the credits is fantastic. I want the CD!
