Cinderella was one of the first movies I've ever seen and for me it's timeless. It's a lovely film, with wonderful animation. My favorite animation scene was the dress scene - I love those mice. Even the songs are beautiful, not as good as those of Snow White, but they are a pleasure to sing and remember Tchaikovsky. A dream is a desire and therefore this is love? they are extraordinary. Even the characters are a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and mice provide great comic relief. Even the stepsisters were well made, as was Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother the best, she was really bad, compared to a great character in the name of the Fairy Godmother. True, the film drags on slightly, with the antics of rats, but they were really funny, so I don't care. I don't think it's overvalued, undervalued, don't you mean? He rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel does on Cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great adaptation of Cinderella, try the wonderful Ever After or the sumptuous Slipper and the Rose, which is not so beautiful. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I have the mistake of possessing, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
