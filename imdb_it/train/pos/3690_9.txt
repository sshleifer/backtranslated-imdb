Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the capacity to love the whole world, but since a human heart is very small, every human being has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of today's most eminent directors when they decided to profess the eternal love for that special place and to describe situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking walk through Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, desires and expectations. /> <br /> Always a few more quarters, always a completely moving story about ordinary people looking for love, whether in a parking lot, an art studio, a subway station. And Paris je t'aime speaks of a wide range of loves: love for one's partner, son, parent, for those who have meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs to be rekindled, love accidental for that stranger while your eyes meet, or love that is not destined to be ... today, but who knows? <br /> <br /> However, this film is not just about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not faded at all, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories could develop further, but not all and this is the thing I find missing, and by "further development" I don't mean no specific reference to the future of the characters. As for everything else, I can only say ... captivating. It makes you want to leave everything behind, flee to Paris and live those little novels.
