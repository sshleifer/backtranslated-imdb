[ATTENTION: CONTAINS SPOILER] <br /> <br /> I have an adult friend for whom the idea that her parents have sexual relations makes her terribly uncomfortable. It occurred to me when I reflected on the audience's reaction to "The Mother". <br /> <br /> People were breathless when May (Anne Reid) passionately writhed in bed with her younger lover, HÃ¤dren (Daniel Craig), or later saw sexually explicit drawings of May. I doubt that the public was astounded by the nudity or content of the drawings as it was to feel uncomfortable to see a sixty year old woman having a great time. <br /> <br /> Screenplay Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Son the Fanatic") demonstrates once again why it is among the most cutting-edge storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to take. This sad family drama is not a film that you can say that you enjoyed watching because it is raw, complex and often makes you very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it is powerfully good stuff. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed "Notting Hill", of all things) create an unintended, heartbreaking and superbly performed portrait of an old woman who realizes, after all these years, she can and should still enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a wonderfully epiphanic moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult, May replies: "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, indeed. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her May shift. He is thin, sober, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. He looks at Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. Or when he asks Paula to open the main door after a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. In the most devastating moment of the film, May falls to her knees in front of Darren, willing to do anything for him, just asking him to be kind. This is an extraordinarily gritty performance by an extraordinary actress. I liked the use of Michell's natural sound, especially when May and Toots first come to Bobby. He perfectly illustrated the cacophony of May and Toots, the irreverent way in which their family welcomes them. <br /> <br /> This film has at times reminded me of the honesty and crudeness of Mike Leigh's work, except for "The Mother" gets stuck in a slight sense of optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My only quibble: Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene an almost banal feeling. Lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain sways gently in the breeze. And the only sound is of May in the grip of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely envelops the role of Darren, make their way so fearlessly into these roles that it is unfair to hide their almost primitive energy characters to the public. Especially since Michell has no qualms about making sex scenes later on. <br /> <br /> This film has no immensely nice characters. We stand in solidarity with May, but she also causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt that Kureishi meant his story to people with nice people. His point, I believe, was to unmask a family that is already breaking when something emotionally catastrophic happens. It is adamant in its whiteness and at the end unforgettable.
