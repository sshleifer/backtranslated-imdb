THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always hear that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "odd couple." Their incredible work on the television series from the early 70s to the 70s was a highwater brand for television at that time ... easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the story. However, how can you go wrong with a pair of Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau is particularly fit as Oscar, the slob. Lemmon takes some time to get used to Felix, particularly if you've seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance before. The script is good ... definitely the best of Neil Simon. (I will record here stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst and most overvalued playwrights of the American theater.) The plot is simple: Felix, a maniac and barely separated from his wife moves with Oscar, the slob who needs help to save money for food payments. Their living arrangement becomes very similar to a wedding, culminating in some fun tiffs and gaiters. Lots of fun and some great one-liners.
