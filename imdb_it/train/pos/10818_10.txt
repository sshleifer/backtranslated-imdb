Why does this score so low? I really don't understand ... Is it because of bad acting? Bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in low-budget style horror movies? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in those films. People who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogues should not be allowed to evaluate bad and less expensive movies. Those films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I was expecting a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty ugly (most of the time they're just animal guts on the actors' bodies and that's lame), but I didn't care much because the movie it's hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the acting is exhilarating (bad acting is a GOOD thing in low-budget style horror films), dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a GOOD thing in low-budget style horror films), the zombie rapist with a huge cock is hilarious, the flying demon is hilarious and I could go on forever, but I don't want to say too much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene where a girl masturbates a sex doll like is alive lol! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the lol sex doll! <br /> <br /> The best jokes in the movie: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * sniffs coke * Detective Sloane: What * beep * Are you doing, good manners? What the hell did you do? What the hell is that? Detective Manners: It's nothing, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * injects heroin into his arm * Detective Sloane: What * beep * you are doing, Manners? Are you * beep * crazy? Detective Manners: It's cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * repeatedly kicks a random guy * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, ways? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac was hovering over demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock! He just started smashing his head on the rock! I think it's on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
