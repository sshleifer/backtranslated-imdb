McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is told in flashback mode, and concerns a family of three otherwise normal and happy that goes through a very bizarre situation. I can't say much more without ruining the whole film, I'm sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be, at least, surprised. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job directing those guys, and his acting is fantastic. McConaughey's acting is solid and fits the law perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film challenges you to think. Is Dad Crazy? Is there a God? Do demons exist? Up to where you go wrong. And what's "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. <br /> <br /> And then I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those films that deserves and rewards a second or even third vision.
