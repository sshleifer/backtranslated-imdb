Pleasant movie although I think it has the potential to be even better if it had more depth. It is a mystery to know why Elly is so reclusive in the middle of the film. Then, when we are finally given an explanation that goes back to his childhood, there are still not many details. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> However, it is still a good movie that I would watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
