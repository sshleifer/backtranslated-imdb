Of course if you are reading my review you have already seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 * 7 servant on his bike. Watch movies and emulate characters, etc. etc. I love the scene when a stone breaks in Kader Khan's mouth as he eats. Also where Shakti Kapoor tells a fabulous story of Raja Babu's business at the table and Govinda wears a 'dharam-veer' uniform and makes sentimental comments. This is my favorite scene from the movie. The scene 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' is just chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogue. It's brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just look at these actors who help each other and continue to take the scene away from each other. Its total entertainment. If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader Khan then it is a must. I think RB is sixth on my list of David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precedes this gem of a movie. 7/10.
