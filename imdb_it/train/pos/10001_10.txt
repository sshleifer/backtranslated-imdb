Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and the love scenes in the clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on the face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The advocacy of lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling his boss, and being dishonest Pepto Bolt's lawyer shrugged indifferently "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Even Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of the next Larry Sanders show, is also fantastic here as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malicious than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics. Look for the leg scene and the two great diggers who fight (one bleeds). This movie gets better every time I see it (which is quite often).
