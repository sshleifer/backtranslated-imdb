I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he had after returning. So when I saw a part of this movie one night on a pay-per-view channel I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and I felt prepared for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it's the most heartbreaking movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD right after I rented it. The way you emotionally move in so many directions is something I've never experienced with any other film. As for films in Vietnam, I think it's the best, even if the platoon is approaching by a second. On top of that, I think it's also the best interpretation of Colin Farrell as an actor. I like it in most of his films but this was incredible. I gave this vote 10 because it's one of my first five favorite movies.
