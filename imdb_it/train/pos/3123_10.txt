This is the first 10 out of 10 I gave a movie of. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action: there are no slow parts, great acting, intelligent writing. I also liked the shooting style in which the tremor and the different angles made it feel like I was part of the scene. Finally, I see an action film that does not try to please all sectors of the public (ie there is no forced novel). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Bourne films, but I loved this one. <br /> <br /> Attention: after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a little before driving your car!
