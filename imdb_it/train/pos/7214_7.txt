Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of those mysterious films in the Sleuth tradition that would be very easy to ruin given a real examination of the film's plot. So I will be brief in saying that it is about a play, a man who is a famous yellow playwright, another man who is a promising writer, the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been, and a long German psychic for the ride. The director Sidney Lumet, no stranger to the film, is good enough for the most part to create the tension necessary for the film. The dialogue is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in roles like these. Christopher Reeve is useful and actually grows on you the more you see him act. Irene Worth stands out as the psychic fun. What about Dyan Cannon? I like how Lumet made her back in those tight pants and probably wore the tightest peaks around her, but she's terribly annoyed in this role - a role that should have been given to an older and certainly less seductive actress. But why quibble with an obvious attempt to corrupt his male spectators when nothing will change now? Deathtrap is fun, sophisticated, witty and classy. The mystery has some obvious flaws that diminish it a little, and I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending, but watching Caine and Reeve under the direction of Lumet with Levin's high verbosity was enough to ensnare my interest and keep him captive full length of the film.
