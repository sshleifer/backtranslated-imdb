Mild, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something huge. In front and behind the camera it creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces that I had the pleasure of seeing, seeing and seeing again. It never disappoints me. People, even people who know me quite well, thought / thought there was / was something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or should I say, devotion to "Le Locataire" They might be right, I don't know , but there is something that irresistibly fascinates in Polanski's darkness and I have not even mentioned humor. The mystery that surrounds the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes it and, of course, us, me. That building populated by great winners of the old Academy Award: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For those who love movies, this is a mandatory view. One, two, three, many, many views.
