I loved this movie! It was all I could do to not burst into tears as I watched, but it's really very uplifting. I was struck by the performance of Ray Liotta, but above all by the talent of Tom Hulce who plays Ray's twin brother, mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. But the character of Tom, even if heartbreaking, knows no self-pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, don't miss it !!
