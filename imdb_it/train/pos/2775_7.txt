The old movie fans will know why I would call it "The man with the gray flannel dress". Most of the Bible-based films are basically schlock - what might arouse smiles and giggles here is like Peck, tries to raise awareness about a variety of psychological and social problems with the spear that carried the Neanderthals all over him. Like a great novel, it falls flat like unleavened bread. But there is something compelling about this film. Of all the great images of the Hollywood Bible he very clearly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average American towards faith in the biblical God. Billy Sunday's thesis is in discussion with the antithesis of H.L. Mencken for the whole script. Who has the upper hand in the synthesis of the Celestial Choir depends on your point of view. In addition to this, D & B boasts a good performance by Peck (especially in the closing repentance scene) and by Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife Michol, a lively and moody atmosphere (good idea to set most of the action to the dawn or night), and finally the thrilling representation of the Psalm of the Twenty-third.
