This is the best of the 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; its most successful at least. He was one of the most important directors of New Germany after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was as magnificent as the cold and calculating Maria Bruan, who lost her husband in the War, found him after taking an American soldier as a lover, lost him again after going to prison for her, and found him agin at the end. His day and a half of marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end. <br /> <br /> Such is life. Things come and go and you do the best you can. You can give up or change your way of thinking to survive. Although Maria has adapted her way of thinking and done what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which makes the end a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Great drama.
