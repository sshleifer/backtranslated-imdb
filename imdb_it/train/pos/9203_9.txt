This is one of Dev Anand's films that has given great but distinguished films to Hindi film industries like Jewel thief and guides. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple: a brother looks for his lost sister. The sister joined the hippies who smoke from the plate and sing Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the film portrays some of the significant events that the world has experienced in the Hippie culture of the 1970s, their submission to drugs, freedom, the duty to escape, the family and the adoption of anything new like the Eastern religion (which was new to whites). They were managed perfectly. Zeenat gave the best of himself and Dev as usual was remarkable. The songs are the most used (unlike the fact that they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this film. They have not been ruined. A perfect example is "Dekho or deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo". Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but it is not the essence of the film. Devji as a whole, who believes in making different films, was successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience the hippie culture and the beautiful Nepal of the 70s.
