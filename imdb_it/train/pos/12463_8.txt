Nora is a single mother out of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 70s, as well as her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. Isn't the philosophy of free love entirely out of the system? and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie. Hazlehurst won his first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for his extraordinary portrait of Nora, who makes sure he does the right thing by his sons, but falls in love with Javo addict (Friels) at the same time. Garner ?? who later would be costar in films like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHS and STRANGE PIANET ?? he is well portrayed as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in preparation for his role as a guest on the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 ???) appears as a bearded painter. Director Cameron's first effort is a winner; has continued to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his latest projects. But it is the extraordinary delivery of Hazlehurst that gives life to the intelligent screenplay and research, based on the award-winning novel by Helen Garner.
