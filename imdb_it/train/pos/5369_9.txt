Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold will play Ben Richards, a man unjustly condemned to play "The Running Man", a deadly TV show in which people must keep moving to try to escape the brutal death at the hands of the "Stalkers". Of course, people are expected to eventually die and it's up to Arnold to prove the wrong system. <br /> <br /> I haven't read Stephen King's book, but this is a great film regardless, one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the role of man of action, delivering death with unforgettable jokes. The classics are probably the "It was a real pain in the neck" after strangling a guy with barbed wire, and "It had to split!", Referring to the fate in which he had just sawed someone vertically. Dawson is perfectly irritating as the TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' are properly camped out. The action is violent, but it's an action movie. This is the point. The film has a fast pace, and at 90 minutes the welcome remains. <br /> <br /> With Starsky and Hutch Paul Michael Glaser at the helm, and built in the wake of the success of The Terminator, previously this film was probably seen as another irrational action vehicle for Arnold, and very far away. But today, anyone watching a lot of TV could see how the film is approaching reality. I wouldn't be surprised if you turned on the TV in the "near future" and saw a show not too far away. <br /> <br /> On that depressing note, I still have to recommend "The Running Man" to anyone who loves the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
