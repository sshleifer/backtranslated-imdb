I found this film hilarious. The parodies of other popular films of that period were among the most enjoyable I've seen in this type of film. Give it a go. If you've seen the movies this movie is spoofing and you get humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched the movie with me) heard the funniest part of the movie (this is not a spoiler because I DO NOT want to tell you what's really going on) was a scene with "flashy thingy "of MIB. When they discover the device for the first time and don't know what it does ... and then again later in the movie ... you'll understand when you arrive. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is that I have never been able to find it on DVD so I can buy a copy.
