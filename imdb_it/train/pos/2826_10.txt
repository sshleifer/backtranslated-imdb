I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was part of the vast Paramount chain of vaudeville homes. Does this Paramount have an organ ?? Mighty Wurlitzer? also beautifully restored - which was used to accompany the silent films of the day. <br /> <br /> We were fortunate to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer, appropriately playing music and thematic compositions that fit the action of the film. Printing was an almost perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the whole experience was a unique possibility in life to see a silent film as you wanted to see. <br /> <br /> This was Greta Garbo's first American film. He was only 20 but already had 6 Swedish films in his repertoire. <br /> <br /> It is rather ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; although the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the staging, it was necessary to leave a lot to the imagination. <br /> <br /> The modern public, for the most part, does not understand silent films ?? Acting was different then, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. So the audience laughs at inappropriate times ?? the acting is seen as "hammy" and too much done ?? but it was simply the style of the period. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all its subtlety, has done a lot to inaugurate the new era of acting: it could say more with a half-closed eye and the volumes could be light in a look down or a simple shake of shoulders. She exemplifies the truism that "an image is worth a thousand words". <br /> <br /> Although this is Garbo's first American film, it is obvious that the studio knew what they had in their hands: this was the MGM film at its best. The sets and costumes were magnificent. The special effects ?? which by today's standards are rather weak ?? They were still thrilling and fantastic. <br /> <br /> The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (based on the novel by Entre Naranjos) would seem to be tailor-made for Garbo; showcases its strengths, enhances its resources and there are no language problems to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress without any suspension of disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> His co-star was MGM reply to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day would ever do in a movie: afford to look unattractive, look silly and grow old ungraceful. <br /> <br /> Are there some pretty good parts of the character that are more than adequately played? especially if you consider the power plant that was Garbo. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupid and Martha Mattox as Do√±a Bernarda Brull. <br /> <br /> Is this when the extraordinary director of photography, William H. Daniels, met Garbo ?? they continued to make 20 films together. (He was the director of photography in 157 films and his career lasted fifty years!) He was able to capture his ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was the main responsible for the moniker with which he became famous: The Divine Garbo. Without his magnificent skills it would not have been the success that he was. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is a rare opportunity: if you have the chance, don't miss it.
