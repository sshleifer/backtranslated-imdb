The best of Zorro magazines and one of my favorite magazines, period. This is a serial set of the period immediately after the birth of Mexico. The new nation relies on the gold produced by this city to maintain the solvent republic. However, a golden god, Don del Oro is unleashing the Indians and stealing gold for himself. His Zorro and his group of men to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a winning Zorro and he cuts a fascinating figure by entering a good selection of scraps (most of which have been reused by later serial Zorro and other serial). History moves and isn't it clear who the real villain is? There's a reason why I've seen this the most serial I've seen, it's simply a great action movie. The only thing I can compare is the Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other swordsmen of the period. It's super and highly recommended.
