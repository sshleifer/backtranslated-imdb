I have seen some episodes of Cold Case over the years, starting with the episodes of the first season in 2003-2004. And while most was good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but it has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (ie the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt anyone could look at it without being deeply moved in their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story essentially concerns a case that was reopened, based on the testimony of a dying drug dealer. The two main actors are two police officers of the 1960s, named Sean Coop (aka, the victim of the cold who makes his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In history, Coop is single, a Vietnam veteran with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners of the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that both must hide from a profoundly and obviously homophobic culture prevailing at that time. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the flashbacks of their lives are mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then scattered everywhere. Examples include their red team car, the yellow curtains blowing gently near the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss while they were in a state of alcohol . I found it interesting that only the selected elements were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I have not yet understood the color scheme and logic. <br /> <br /> The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. A key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's son. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected official colleague of the force, confronts Coop with rumors concerning Coop's relationship with Jimmy. At Coop, at this point, one can feel sorry because the shame and misfortune of Coop's father were piled up on Coop: "You will not dishonor our family ... and you too are not my son". - clearly indicative of the hostile opinions of the homosexual relations of that era. <br /> <br /> Additional tensions can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer approach after Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and Robin Little Men". <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more than Jimmy in his life. Once he can see the tension in Jimmy's face that he has to choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church, and yet his eternal devotion to Coop. Eventually, Jimmy turns away from Coop, realizing he can't have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that has reached higher strength. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene In the entire episode, Coop, while he was dying from gunshot wounds in his car, quietly uttered his last words on the police radio to his companion: "Jimmy. .. we were the lucky ones, don't forget it. "<br /> <br /> The selection of the soundtrack was exceptional during the episode. I liked the final scene with actor Chad Everett, playing Jimmy still grieved, only a lot older now, and clearly I still miss his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is undoubtedly the most well written, well acted and well done of all the Cold Case episodes I've ever seen.
