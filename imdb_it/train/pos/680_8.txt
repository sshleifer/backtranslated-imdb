"The Last Wave" is one of those films that is very much based on the mind. The title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be a last wave that erases everything. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a lawyer from Sydney hired to defend some Aboriginal people accused of murder. During this period, unusually heavy rainfall occurred in Australia. While defending the aborigines, David learns the theory of the last wave and begins to wonder if it is only mythology. <br /> <br /> The last sequence of the film is a metaphor for descending into the depths of the mind. Peter Weir has created a perplexing but stimulating film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, look at the "making of" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some nuances of the film, some of which refer to the background of Richard Chamberlain.
