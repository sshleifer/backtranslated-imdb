I know it seems strange to come from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped shooting, but I love this show. I don't know why, but I like watching it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I could find to buy the seasons on DVD was in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. This is disappointing, but that's fine. I will continue to search online. If anyone has any advice on where to buy the second to the 14th season, write to me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. The only downside is that DVDs come from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and on my computer. Oh good. I still have it!
