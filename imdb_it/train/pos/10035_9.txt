I think James Cameron could become my favorite director because this is my second review of his films. Anyway, everyone remembers the Titanic RMS. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was all about the news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie of it, but he plays two fictional characters instead of the ship. Well, in the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and done zero and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not annoying but they look at this and you will find out why they could become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I think is bad luck, destiny, hand of God (no intention of blasphemy), or simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We have a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (idk was so cute), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill) , Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many others. We also received the current treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is fantastic, especially in the second part, the drama is just as good. Eventually you can drop your downpours or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and finds instead a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond said. Call and tell his story about the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated from the social class and, ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the plot works and there are very few flaws. Do Titanic, an 86% fantastic
