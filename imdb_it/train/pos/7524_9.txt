For a film that apparently talks about sex and skin, it has no right to be so strangely sweet. The story of Bettie Page, a good Southern Christian girl, whose mother wouldn't have left her appointment until she got married, moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful pin-up girl of her age, is driven by an exceptional performance by Gretchen Moll. His Page is not able to reconcile the images he takes (no one is allowed to touch, it's all fun and respectful) with evidence of pornography and alleged negative effects that his images have on the world around him. <br /> <br /> Page was a source of inspiration for every burlesque artist, not only because he had a figure to die for, but because he invested every image with an innocent sense of fun that was both sexy and simple . Rather like this movie, actually. Filmde in black and white and glorious technicolor, it's a nice way to spend a couple of hours.
