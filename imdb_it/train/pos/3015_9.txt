Why is it not possible to film this kind of compact and fun mystery in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing right down to the bottom. The cast is a great ensemble. William Powell exhibits a true quality star. Who knows, maybe he was rehearsing for his future as Nick Charles. It is a joy to watch. You can also see why Eugene Pallette has made more than 200 films. He's a great leading actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor does a job above average in a not very meaty role. All other hands fit in to make this a really nice way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect that Michael Curtiz had a ball that ran his own. Good boy!
