It is so gratifying to see a great work of art transformed into another without distortions or tricks. I had no idea how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book, you would understandably be afraid of seeing a wrong interpretation done more for an art film project than to actually bring the deeper meaning of the story on the screen. There are a couple of examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and improbable as history, the film leaves nothing. It is as if the director read Bulgakov's work in the same way that a conductor reads a score - without a missed note. Why can't we find this talent here in the United States? So now my favorite book and my movie have the same title.
