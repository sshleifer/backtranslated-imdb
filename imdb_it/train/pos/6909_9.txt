... and if you are very, very good it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This film had a silly story, but after all it was a fantasy, and casting and acting were spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities that you imagine the actors. You can take a look at what the actors are like behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This was one of the best roles of Dreyfuss, just as his character has his best role as a dead dictator! And the scene of separation: like something from Casablanca, indeed! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was superb as head of the Paradorian secret police. He gets some really fun lines, some of which are tributes to other films, like "Rolling up the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as a friend - besides being a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar for tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that Johnny Winters is the CIA agent and the many guest stars who play themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all perfectly done. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unforgettable fun under the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
