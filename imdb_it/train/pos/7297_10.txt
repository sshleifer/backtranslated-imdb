I really liked this movie. The acting was exceptional, as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for. The only part of this movie that I would have changed was the ending. The death of the creature was too horrible for the Sci Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this film. Jeff Combs obviously played a Messiah figure and the creature (or the shark if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. There have been particularly scary scenes that have experienced that "end of the world". I noticed it only after my third vision of this classic creature. I know that many people will not have references to Christianity, but if you look closely you will understand it.
