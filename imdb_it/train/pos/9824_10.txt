This film is an excellent example of the state of erotic B movies: ugly porn movies without hardcore sex. The plot in this is not as bad as these things go; involves a female lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad looking woman, bad series, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. Directors should learn the difference between vulgar and erotic. They don't even have the sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How stupid is it?
