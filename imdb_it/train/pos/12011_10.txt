I am stunned by the negative comments I have read and can only assume that the people who make such comments are less honest. This is the most moving and real portrait of Joseph Smith I've ever seen. It was well acted to the point that sometimes I forgot that I was watching a movie. He brought the life of difficulty of Joseph, his natural optimism, his lasting faith in people and in God, and the extreme sacrifice to life in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe. If anyone from ANY Christian religion can watch this film without being touched in a positive way, I should say that it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the film. I give the film a "10" and encourage honest souls to see it. At MINIMUM is an extremely heartfelt portrait of the man who gave everything he had for what he believed in ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film represents a lasting reminder of the kind of people expects to be- no matter what religious beliefs we possess.- Ann Pruitt-
