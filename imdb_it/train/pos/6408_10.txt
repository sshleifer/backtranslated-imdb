A classic Hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro both give spectacular performances in the two main roles, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, with performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "louse" I could choose is that Theron's role was superfluous and distracting (not his performance was good, it's just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to adapt his role.) <Apart from this, the characterizations, dynamics and action of the history of real life are compelling and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and the way in which their beings evolve are uniquely characterized by performing artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, the rhythm remains intact all the time. The score is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> Are we a predictable Hollywood movie? You bet. So Mike Leigh's addicts should steal a star, but everyone else should appreciate it powerfully.
