This is a documentary I found by chance on the British television channel More4 and I must say that I found it extremely interesting and stimulating. I will also look for the book that was the basic material for this documentary. Basically this is Professor Jared Diamond's theory of why some parts of the earth's societies prospered and others did not. The subject he presented was new to me and he discussed how the luck of the right crops and the right animals he can tame is certainly compelling. As for the documentary, it is well filmed and well narrated with not many of the recreated scenes that spoil many a modern documentary. The diamond also helps not to be condescending, which is a defect of many intellectuals when it tries to convey a message to the masses. People have said that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy this and I see it more as a geologist. It was also pleasant to hear a theory about the evolution of society not based on religion. Highly recommended vision.
