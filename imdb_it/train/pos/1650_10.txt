An excellent series, masterfully recited and directed, but unloved (I was told) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn from him after only one presentation. It is now visible only in private collections and through the British Film Institute on special request. Very unlucky, because the nuanced portrait of Ian Holm of the tired but determined Bernard Samson is superb; one of his best performances. The supporting cast, including the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, is superb. With Mel Martin playing the conflicted and treacherous wife, and Michael Degen in the role of mercurial Werner, the story positively simulates with the tragic and fatal personal consequences of the great game.
