This is one of those films that explore the cultural clash between people of Eastern origin in Westernized cultures. <br /> <br /> To love on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract because of greater cultural differences. Ken, a rock and roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so he can stay in the United States when his visa expires. It is expected that the marriage will be only temporary, that is until Kyoto acquires its legal status again. But, Ken, who seems to be lost in every relationship, has a liking for Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work. This, despite the encouragement of his friend to download Kyoto and get rid of all the commitments towards the girls, is bad for rock n 'roll if not to inspire some songs to write about broken hearts and all the rest. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education, and doesn't expect to be married to Ken all this time. Not only that, he is nostalgic and wants to return to Japan. It is sad that this is finally someone that Ken thinks he can love and be with and everything else, apart from the only time he thinks he has found someone to feel like this, the girl does not expect to stay that way long. It's not like she doesn't like Ken, she's just used to a whole different lifestyle. He says "I can't tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can't tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a 1980s killer-nintendo soundtrack. I chose Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies of the 80s, Tokyo Pop. And, for those of you who loved Loving on Tokyo Time, take a look at Tokyo Pop (a New York singer travels to Japan and joins a Japanese American cover band), except it's a film with a happy ending. <br /> <br />
