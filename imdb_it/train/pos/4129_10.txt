It is a show of Americanized cooking competitions. It will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is fantastic. I don't care less about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity of the dishes, from the chef to the goofy chairman. Really a good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You could criticize the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It's quite fun to watch and in general the winner deserves the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
