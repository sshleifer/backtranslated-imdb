This is a VERY fun movie. Some of the reviews I read on this forum were written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort for serious drama. IT HAS NOT BEEN MADE ... It is an extremely funny film, interpreted in an ironic way. Obviously all the actors have fun while they entertain us. The fighting sequences are lively, lively and, above all, not free. The so-called "green death", used on a couple of occasions, is not, as I read in a review, "creepy". A couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts struggle between Doc and Seas towards the end of the film. Hey, cut down ... Again, I remind everyone it's a funny movie. Each phase of this "fight" was captioned, which added to the fun aspect. The actors weren't trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks fantastic in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way in which the "bad boy" (Seas) final fate is addressed. I promise you that if you don't try to take this movie very seriously and just watch it for the entertainment value, you'll spend 100 minutes pleasantly.
