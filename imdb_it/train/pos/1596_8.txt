Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them - this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years - still in love. The whole cast does a great job at Aiello and John Mahoney: it shows a real slice of life. Even though I saw him a long time ago, I'm glad that he finally catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to opera scenes to kitchen table topics: this is a very funny movie.
