And it's not because from his days in "Clarissa Explains It All" that I had a bit of a crush on Melissa Joan Hart, that at the time this show was popular she was already in her 20s, but was still able to get teenage roles . "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" was Hart's next big leap after his "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - an adolescent witch who tries to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of the everyday life of adolescents. She is helped by her efforts by her two aunts and a wise black cat as she goes from high school to college and finally to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is the show heart and soul. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" is very moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how beautiful it was. I just hope there were some more recent episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
