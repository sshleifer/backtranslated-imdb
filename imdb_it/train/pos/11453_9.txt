The filmmaker inspired the art of Andy Goldsworthy, his search for closeness to earth and water, and his sense of proportion - and so gently, so wonderfully breathed that he resumed filming for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and unites it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in plain sight. Watch this movie!
