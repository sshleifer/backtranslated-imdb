`Bruce Almighty 'will sweep the Academy Awards with a record of 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass "Titanic" as the highest grossing film of all time! The illustrious personality of Jim Carrey will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These fantasies of grandeur would be transparent only if the directors (including Carrey) possessed the powers of God. That same premise is the fundamental ingredient of Carrey's new laugh fight "Bruce Almighty". Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so completely obsessed with being the main anchor that holds God for his total guilt for his setbacks. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the "Gift of God" (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Obviously, Bruce gets "carreyed" away with his new blessed faculties and use selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual omnipotent comedy form in "Bruce Almighty". Jennifer Aniston was not "mis.pittiful" like Bruce's girlfriend. However, my first prize goes to director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for n. 2, and showing us the most exhilarating bathing scene with headphones of all time! "Bruce Almighty" is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still a gigantic "Carreyism" exhibition! **** Good
