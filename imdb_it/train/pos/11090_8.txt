The success of the married and self-taught businessman Harry Mitchell (a superb performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulterous adolescence with the young stripper Sweet'n'sexy Cini (the splendid Kelly Preston). Harry is being blackmailed by a trio of cheap and sloppy hoods - the bad director of porn movies Raimy (a beautifully slimy John Glover), the owner of an anxious striptease Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and the crazy exploiter Bobby Shy (one frighteningly intense Clarence Williams III) - who filmed his relationship with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did. This in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and will between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, who adopts a hard script based on the detective novel of Elmore Leonard's novel, cleverly maintains a lively and snappy rhythm, offers a lot of compelling tension and effectively creates an irresistibly seductive atmosphere. The gossip is all uniformly excellent, with thrusts supported by Ann-Margret as Harry's bitter and neglected wife, Barbara, Vanity as the cheeky prostitute Doreen, and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner, Jim O'Boyle. The tight and tight weave keeps viewers always close at hand. The evil profane dialogue, the glossy cinematography of Jost Vacano, the moving soundtrack of Gary Chang, the harshly amoral tone and the thrilling conclusion are all equally on the money too. As an added bonus, both Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A small, very strong and satisfying number that is worth checking out.
