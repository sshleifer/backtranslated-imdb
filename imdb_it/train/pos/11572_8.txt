"In April 1946, the University of Chicago agreed to operate the Argonne National Laboratory, with an association of Midwestern universities offering research sponsorship. Argonne thus became the first" national "laboratory, but did not remain in its original position in the Argonne forest In 1947, it moved further west of the "windy city" to a new site in Illinois farmland. When Alvin Weinberg visited Argonne's director, Walter Zinn, in 1947, he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site When Zinn described a heavy water reactor that operated at a tenth of the power of the materials test reactor being designed at Oak Ridge, Weinberg joked it would be easier if Zinn took the project Oak Ridge operated the material test reactor at a tenth capacity. The joke turned out to be unintentionally prophetic. "<br /> <br /> The S-50 plant used the convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns. It was built next to the K-25 power plant, which provided the necessary steam. Much less efficient than the K-25, the S-50 was shot down after the war. <br /> <br /> Concerned that the research program of the Atomic Energy Commission could become too academic, Lilienthal established a committee of industrial consultants, and during a November visit to Oak Ridge, he discussed with Clark Center, manager of Carbide & Carbon, a subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation in Oak Ridge, the possibility that the company would take over the management of the laboratory. <br /> <br /> Prince Henry (of Prussia) arriving in Washington and visiting the German embassy (1902). Evidently, with Prince Henry of Prussia according to the principles of science and its dangers, theirs were already worried about the applications of the new science with military applications. The Hohenzollern (1902 / II), "the splendid yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm at 34th St. Pier, New York, taken at the exact moment of the arrival of Prince Henry and the raising of the royal standard". If Royalty knew these precautions necessary for the well-being of the citizens, then what was the need for war, the first world war and the second world war. Do I assume the quality of management control? <br /> <br /> So, did Operation Swallow commandos volunteer for a military mission, or business plan, based on the safety principles of Laboratory management? Because presumably theirs had not survived, and those who were captured in Europe ordered to be executed. Of the commando team of 400 men the survivors who were captured were executed by order of the German army against subversion and espionage acts of the state of Germany. <br /> <br /> The Führer n. 003830/42 g.
