Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, which takes very creative directors, publishers and photographers and works on historical themes, what the Japanese call "vintage pieces". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, too. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows you to take a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but not explored in the epic of Kurosawa's samurai or Zaitochi series. Another good example of this kind is Onmyoji (2001). I would put director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave of Japanese directors. Other recent pieces from the Japanese period that I highly recommend include Twilight Samurai by Yomada (2002) and Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003) by Shintaro Katsu.
