At the beginning, this is English, so of course I had a 98% chance that it would be a smart and very good cinema. I've never heard of this movie before. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here comes the female version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was also wrong. Wrong because the two films are very different. My Left Foot was a film similar to John Ford and this is a film similar to Chaplin's (not because it's funny, but Chaplin with that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) I was right because in 1990 the handsome Daniel Day-Lewis becomes a bit ugly playing a crippled person and does it with a great sense of reality. Here, the beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the most beautiful women of the 90s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at his eyes! He had the most beautiful eyes in cinema since they were Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! It is also a real talent, as seen on many other films. See this, you won't regret it! And also a great Branagh job!
