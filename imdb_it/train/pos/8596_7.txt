I thought the sentinel would be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I got a nice surprise. The film is not exceptional but it is very funny and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of the TV series like 24 or Alias. It is very similar to that series and also reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller In the line of fire. If you expect one of the most original and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema, you will be disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you'll like La sentinella. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
