I researched this film a little and discovered a website that states that it was actually a joke about the world of gays and lesbians of the second World War II World War II. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the theatrical comedy was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic because I saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater for the first time when I was in fifth or sixth grade just because my parents brought me. It was hard to take me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns or alien monsters and I thought I'd get bored. But I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart hugged Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and threw away his hat while the camera followed him fluttering to the ground. While the glorious love theme of George Duning skyrocketed, I suddenly realized what it was like to fall in love. The first moments of romantic / sexual love left me stunned as I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only pre-teen boy who has been seduced by the stunning and direct look of Kim Novak. It is ironic that a gay parable was able to restart heterosexual puberty in so many of us. Now I'm on my fifties and I saw the movie last night and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat land fifty years later. . .
