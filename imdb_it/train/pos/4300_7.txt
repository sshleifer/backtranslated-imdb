This film may have been one of those usual "pundits" that tell the daily events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ... broken relationships, building new friendships, street bombardments, almost accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a discarded child under some bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately the director goes beyond those daily events and asks questions to consider even if there are no satisfactory answers. He asks in this chaotic world that things happen, it's just luck when things are going well or, taking a fatalistic view, is a person predestined to be in a certain place at a given time and then be involved in the event and its future takes on a new perspective? Most of us have had a disturbing experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super ego that makes us believe that we are so important? How does a character say ?? once he sat on the edge of the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite films, but it is a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is exceptional in an understanding role.
