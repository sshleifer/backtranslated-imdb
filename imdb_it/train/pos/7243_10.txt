A brilliant Russian emigrant devises Stanislavsky's system to win the contract bridge - which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. <br /> <br /> What could have been just another stupid soap opera is elevated by good production values ​​and excellent acting in a very enjoyable comedy state. Some unexpected touches are launched to keep the viewer's attention engaged - the way the main cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards; the introduction of a zombie acrobat in the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a little madness; and how a great variety of different types of Americans are shown to be fixed by listening to the final game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas and Loretta Young do very well as the Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas soave and sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful (although the script keeps her a little too panted). They are fun to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh offers another good performance as an inexorably cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. Delightful Glenda Farrell avoids her usual spirit personality in a small role as a terrible McHugh gal. Roscoe Karns handles the dialogue as fast as a radiant announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is as wonderful as an expert on snobby bridges. <br /> <br /> Film stars will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent night club patron; Emma Dunn as a twin reporter; Paul Porcasi as owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer in the latest bridge game - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The film exploits the fashion for contract bridge that had crossed the country since its development in the 1920s. The viewer is expected to have a basic understanding of the complexities of the game and not attempt to explain anything to the uninformed.
