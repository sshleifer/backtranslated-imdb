This film is another anthology of horror. It's pretty good, but could have used a little more. I compare it to "The House of Horrors of Doctor Terror", although in this the title fits well. It has four stories all connected in some way by a house. The first story is about a writer and his wife moving here. Create a murderer for his latest novel and then start seeing the killer wander around his house. This is predictable, but eventually throws some twists and turns. The next story is a little more unpredictable, and you really don't know where the hell it's going. This includes Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the group. This guy buys the house, but it's not the house that is the center of attention, but a rather strange wax museum. The third story starts pretty well and features Christopher Lee. This has him like a rather bizarre dad who looks terribly protective of his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's happening the story doesn't end soon enough. It drags a bit towards a very predictable conclusion. Then the final story concerns an actor who buys a cloak from a strange little shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a little story about an officer who was seen throughout the attempt to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I wasn't very happy with the explanation, I don't think he really explained the Cushing story much. I think they needed a little more history for that. All in all it was an interesting set of stories.
