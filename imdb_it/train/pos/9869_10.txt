I must say that this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but I really appreciated it in the second vision, just a few weeks ago. I understand why the sequel is doing such a big deal at the box office. Apparently, many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A wonderful palette of colors (man, this looks good) and lots of good-humored adult (but clean) make this a big winner. The 3-4 minute opening scene with "Scat" is excellent as are the subsequent interludes with him. "Sid" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the film. He usually has something fun to say about the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great character in the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the fierce bad boy-become good tiger sabertooth <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and beautiful colors, but a beautiful sentimental story of how a small child softens a couple of difficult characters. Even this is not interrupted by a lot of songs: just one short and there is nothing offensive, from the point of view of the language. <br /> <br /> If more animated films were so good, I have more.
