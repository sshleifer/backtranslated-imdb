In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is considered not yet ready for the big time by the man who loves her - Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his Oscar-winning first year in "Johnny Eager". <br /> <br /> Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children, with four of them looking like her grandchildren? <br /> <br /> Singing and dancing are simply wonderfully set up, but the way the love story between Heflin and Garland was portrayed left a lot to be desired. It was a kind of Gigi in which a little girl is eventually left by a spell.
