I'm not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read through the other comments before looking at the short. I must say that I disagree with most of the negative comments or problems that people have had with it. <br /> <br /> As a first time, director / producer of "Lone Wolf", I like to see things I can aspire to, not necessarily by professionals, but by people who get their feet wet like me. <br /> <br /> If this is really even from a first timer, as I read, I congratulate the effort. So wonderful work in that sense! There have been some comments on music. I thought it was nice enough for the piece. Some say that for a while it kept buzzing, but I found that it created tension without (us) necessarily being aware of it, and when it pulled the Shoot out and the guitar started to crack the chords, it was like we knew that 'was a train on the tracks, but realize that it is only now in motion. Yes, there is a 180 degree clip / clip, but the shi * happens. Does anyone else see Hugh's dirty shirt turning white (near the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? Look at how much money and who was behind that movie! Give the child a break for God's sake! All in all I think it was done very well. Only two things that I would have mentioned are not worth mentioning: do not stand on a polished brass frame with the camera, and I would have just shown the splatter at the beginning of the shots at a still image, so people do not necessarily know what it is It is. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that it is not difficult to make a film, it only takes time to learn how to do it, so the time to really do it, and then you still have a little more time to think about all the details you'll need to shoot before calling "post-production time!" IMHO, it seems that the director / screenwriter Ryan Jafri has done his homework, and if this is really his first report card, I would give him an "A". The rest of you report to the directors office for a whuppin '.
