My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" from a random stack of films during our weekly horror section excursion - none of us had ever heard of it, but the blurb on the box was really promising. And the film didn't disappoint, although I probably wouldn't call it an exclusive horror movie. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden draws a house and visits her in her dreams. He definitely sleeps when he sees the house, but it is so real in the sense that it is almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in view of subsequent events, does not seem very far from the truth. In any case, he finds he can add to the house, its contents and its surroundings simply by adding to the photo. <br /> <br /> While it is happening, Anna is becoming more and more ill with a fever, and besides this she is becoming totally obsessed with the house and its design. Furthermore, she and her mother also have to deal with the absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long periods, even if one gets the impression that there is actually something more in the story. <br /> <br /> OK, so the drawing material looks pretty nice-- but frankly there's something really threatening about it. The dream world is strangely surreal - the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a desolate field. The people who made the film did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate dream world ... <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, which seems to be the same patient your doctor talks about (I'm not giving it, you know from the moment it seems to be the same child). In reality, Mark cannot walk because of an illness; in the world of Anna's drawing, she can't walk because she didn't draw any legs. He blames himself for his real life sickness and tries to correct the situation, but ... everything starts to get really weird. He even carries his absent father in the drawing, with disastrous results. The pieces with the father are really terrifying. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give anything, so I'll stop here ... There seems to be a lot to do in this movie. I'm sure you'll make a ball by analyzing this thing you do with your friends after seeing it-- Is it a simple story as it seems, or are there really layers of meaning? I don't know, but either way it's quite fascinating. There was a "Nightmare on Elm Street", a quality about it, because at some point reality and dreams intersect. I love things like that. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it looks like it MAY have ended many times, but it didn't. I'm satisfied with the end result (some of you sensitive types may want to have the Kleenex on hand!), Although it might really have a variety of conclusions. However, it does not feel exactly drawn once it is finished, but while you are watching and it continues to fade, it is a bit unnerving. <br /> <br /> Again, "Paperhouse" is really a nice movie. It is well done and acting, especially Charlotte Burke like Anna, is top notch. Burke, which never appeared before or after the film, is a real gem. I don't know why he never did anything else, but either way it's really convincing and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror film, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / something else type of film, with some very horrifying moments - but you can still watch it with your family and don't be worried that your little brother or grandmother will be disgusted by splashes of blood or something. <br /> <br /> Give him a chance, you won't regret it! And maybe you should also read the book ...
