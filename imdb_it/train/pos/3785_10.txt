This film is very underrated. It is very imaginative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun and, in my opinion, this film is on top of the first one. But the film was forgotten when it first came out, and it has become even more neglected over the years. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office, while the first was a very good and very popular success. <br /> <br /> I think the problem could be that this movie was just released a couple of years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already looked "like 80s". Although the 1980s were only a couple of years ago at that time, the music and style scene for children had changed dramatically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and the Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with their music by Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses and their 80s style seemed so out of place and very obsolete in '91, and I think it's one of the big reasons why the film bombed at box office. No one, but surfers kept saying things like "excellent!" it's false!" in 1991. "Gremlins 2", also released in the early 90s, suffered a similar fate of being a good movie that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the 80s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was a change much faster than in the 90s and 00s. 1991 did not resemble 1988 or 1989, while at this time, in 2002 and the last year of 2001, it still seems 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only "Excellent adventure", which is it was made in 1988, it was published that year instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was quickly made and published in 1989, so it would probably also have been received as the first.
