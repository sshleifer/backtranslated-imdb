I really enjoyed this show - we got the first and only, it would seem, series in the UK on channel 4. The characterization was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different facets of the small town were No it was a trace of laughter - I had never seen it in an American television comedy at the time except for Larry Sanders and it worked really well here, increasing the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that, and not just hanging it up for the cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, a small eccentric number that tickled me just right: I can't help but think that perhaps his brand with a certain audience was missing. I think it would have been a cult success in the UK if it was shown at an acceptable time. <br /> <br /> I will end this with my standard comment: where the hell can I get this? look at it again? Some idea?
