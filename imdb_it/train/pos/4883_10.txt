We, as a family, were so happy about "The Last of the Blonde Bombshells" that we purchased a copy for our home video library. <br /> <br /> The acting is A1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script well written. The music / songs are timeless and brings us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. Outlining the story here would ruin the "plot" because it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Full marks for this more enjoyable and uplifting production and we strongly recommend anyone looking for a belly laugh and lots of music.
