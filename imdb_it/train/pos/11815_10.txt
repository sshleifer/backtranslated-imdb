The moment I write this, I see that out of over 15,000 votes it has a rating of 5.8. There is something wrong with that photo. I personally give him a 10. I can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it's been rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It's a movie based on a comic book hero. This film won more than its share of prizes. He won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations .... right there tells me that it is better than a 5.8. Some fantastic acting of some very good actors, some great special effects and, in my opinion, if it weren't already a classic for years to come. If you're looking for pure entertainment, be sure to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can see several times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
