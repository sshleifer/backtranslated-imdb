This film is a must-see film for everyone. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the soldier's point of view, as everyone in America should. The previous reviewer totally missed the point: the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who live in our "enemy" territory and what it does to soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them IMMEDIATELY home, before another person is killed or injured. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are mentally injured, with post-traumatic stress disorder or physically, with limbs lost. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
