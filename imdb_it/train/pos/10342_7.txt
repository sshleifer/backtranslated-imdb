Melvyn Douglas once again offers a refined performance in which, this time, he plays the role of a detective who cannot put love before duty and adventure, and the beautiful and warm Joan Blondell (who, far from being illiterate, as a review suggested, he wrote a novel about his early life) as funny as ever is his always suffering love. It's almost a dejected comedy, almost a Thin Man movie, almost a series, I guess, that a sequel couldn't do it. It does not reach enough classic status, but it has all the ingredients for an 85-minute fun with a punctual but continuous script, good actors and a direction that keeps everything fast enough that it almost doesn't notice that Williams (Douglas) is not exactly Columbo when it comes to detecting. I wish there were more movies like this.
