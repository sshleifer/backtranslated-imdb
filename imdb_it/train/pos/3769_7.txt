Oh, come on, learn to have some fun. When I was a child, oh, this movie was worthy of an Oscar for me. I thought he was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I had seen. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a little stupid, but come on. If you liked "Excellent adventure", you should probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the film before "Friend, where is my car?" Only this is really fun. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you liked the first one, you would like "Bogus Journey". It's just a fun movie with some memorable characters. Just for your fun, watch it, let it go, and remember it's a silly comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
