Busy Phillips performed an incredible show, both comic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good but Busy stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a film starring Busy, which wasn't all that great. If Busy doesn't get a nomination of any kind for this film, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
