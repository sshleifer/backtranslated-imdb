People tend to complain about the number of films made on mentally disabled people. I don't consider it a valid criticism, nothing but complaints of too many films on any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael does a great job with the script and the direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, with Duquenne practically playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly large field of events and does not simply read what was seen in "Rain Man". The ending is rather depressing, but it doesn't spoil the wonderful story that came before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
