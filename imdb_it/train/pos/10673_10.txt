hi for all the people who saw this wonderful film i'm sure you would have liked it as much as i did. I love the songs once you have seen the show that you can sing as if you were part of the show singing and dancing. dance and sing. the ONE song is also a musical song of all time and the strips at the end with the mirror is so oh you have to watch this
