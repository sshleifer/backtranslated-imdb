The stock market crash of 1929 and the depression after almost ruining the American Musical Theater, was in fact the final death blow to vaudeville. Those behind the scenes have been hit like those before. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate the entertainment economy and its personal economy, theater director James Cagney comes up with a brilliant idea. Live prologue stages relevant to the films that are shown in the various cinemas that are popping up from the old theaters during the night. Some other competitors take advantage of it and the competition is ongoing. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. It gives James Cagney the chance to show some of his versatility as a dancer and also as a toast. In his retreat Cagney said that while projecting his few and far between musicals a lot, he could hardly be bothered with some of his dramatic films. He wanted to do some more musicals in his career and I would have liked. <br /> <br /> Obviously the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravagances on the stage of a cinema building defies all logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell will sing three songs in the Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler that further cement that team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and collaborates with James Cagney in my favorite issue from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagney's senseless girl on Friday at the theater. Like in Blonde Crazy, it's the one with the real brains of that duo and it's his quick thinking that exasperates him from some domestic problems he has on top of theatrical ones. One of the best roles for Blondell's screen. <br /> <br /> Search for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the choir as in the IMDb pages for both. John Garfield is briefly seen in the Lil issue of Shanghai. And in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a cinema where they show a western B starring John Wayne. The duke's voice is unmistakable. But what is even more unusual is that the short clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh playing another Cagney assistant in the Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers were playing a little joke there. I have to believe that the clip was intentional. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at its surreal best.
