This film is one of many "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia between the late 1970s and early 1980s, full of low-cost sound effects, supernatural dialogues and lightning-fast martial arts actions. But unlike most movies of this genre, it also has a decent storyline and lots of good comedy. When the workers of a dye factory are forced to leave their jobs by the Manchu bullies, they hire a con man (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them. When his attempt fails miserably, he heads for a Shaolin temple to learn how to fight for real. But instead of making him a Kung-Fu student, Master instead orders him to build scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 rooms. Well, it turns out that while performing these humble tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) he is learning the skills to become a Kung-Fu expert! It's a bit like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores - "Wax on, wax off" and so on. There's a lot of great comedies from start to finish, and a lot of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu torturers. "This time it's not just tricks, it's the real thing!" Liu declares, proudly beating his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you can't miss this!
