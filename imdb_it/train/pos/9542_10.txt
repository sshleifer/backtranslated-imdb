Don't be fooled by the stupid characters of the title, this is a sweet ride! A true successor of Tetsuo, Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this gem starts with a bang and throws blood on the wire until the credits come out. It seems that the aliens are taking control of people's bodies and modifying them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the enjoyment of their species. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. This is mainly for the plot, but who cares when the blood is so good? I have no idea how many buckets of slime have been used, but it's disgusting to watch. There is an interesting and effective use of stop-motion when acquisitions are in progress, and loving care is lavished on all the effects of the creature and make-up. CGI is a bit limited, but that doesn't detract from the general quality, at least for me. This was really a fun and shocking movie that deserves a lot of praise and has really earned its place in the Cult Classics stack. Find it and look at it, you won't be disappointed!
