Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly a Sholay. But you can't have a Sholay every week. In fact, in this film you could see the distinct signatures of "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991). However, like most "inspired" movies, this was well inspired, well managed and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to exaggerate with her hysteria, but all the others are commendable. Especially for Dipti Naval: I saw her after so long, but she lost none of her grace. In fact, she behaved much better than when I last saw her. Another of the Bollywood stars that seems to become more beautiful as they age? <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice watch.
