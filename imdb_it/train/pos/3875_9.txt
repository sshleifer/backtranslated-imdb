This film was made by one of Canada's most absurd humorists, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that made a romantic comedy, but knowing it was a heavy cinephile, was seen at every local festival and local film library, I had a positive feeling for this film. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was right. At first glance, the scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a little distorted and difficult to follow, but, according to Pelletier, he is a one-of-a-kind 90-minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> <br /> Allure freely inspired and mostly transformed into Dangerous Liaisons (by Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game of notes written on the fridge. During the film you will have the opportunity to find out who is who and who writes to whom on that damn fridge .... that opens up in an interesting love story. <br /> <br /> Great plot, great photography, great quotes from other films. Should we ask for more for a first movie?
