Wow. A truly fantastic travel film that has tons of super-surreal images, dark intents and a black, rather strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world. It is populated by a group of characters out of the very nice world who bend and float with deformed backgrounds. As in all fantastic fantasies, the wandering plot is secondary to the astonishing images and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death, deluge, aquatic elephants, samurai swordsmen and fishing pigs. I had never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil-work of the American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It is a demented joy for fans of strange and beautiful things and glued me to the screen for fear of losing something extraordinary. In a nutshell, it is "Hello Kitty" without the "o".
