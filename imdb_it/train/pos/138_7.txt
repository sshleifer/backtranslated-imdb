I don't understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is writing and spirit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw create an unusual pair of comics, certainly not the standard types. Although it cannot be said that their characters are well developed that do not make them less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for Spanish dialogue, so it was certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish gives more authenticity. <br /> <br /> An undervalued film, judging by the unusually low score that IMDb users have given. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth at least a 7. A lot of clear films with high scores and making a lot of money at the box office are much less interesting.
