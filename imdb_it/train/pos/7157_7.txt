This film is a fun, entertaining and quality film. The film very skilfully follows the guidelines of the book and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all suitable and you would expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors that give a great effect to the film. The graphics are a bit dubious in some parts, and there are some errors during the film. For example, there is no yellow spotted lizard. The field is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and tend not to show what happens in the field as much as the book. His entire group is mentioned a lot in the book, but it's not in the film. Overall, a great movie for a rainy afternoon
