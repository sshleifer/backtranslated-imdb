My main problem with the film is that it goes on too long. Otherwise, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese peasant who is about to marry through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant who marries Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and are doing quite badly. When he finally gets money to buy a little more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing. At the beginning, all the stars at the head of Muni remain behind. When they leave and arrive in the city, they discover that they have no job and are worse off than before. They even think of selling their youngest daughter as a slave to some money, but decide not to. When a group of people begins to pillage the city, the soldiers show up and begin to execute people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this film.
