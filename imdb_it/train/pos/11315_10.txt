Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. The great directors of Italy in the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium, but it was Luchino Visconti, a visionary man, who had the courage to wear a film as if to show what he was capable of doing. He clearly shows his genius in his illustrious career with "Obsession", a film based on "The Postman Always Ring Twice" by James Cain, which was later made by Hollywood, but this version pales in comparison to what Visconti did in movie . Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included a non-accredited Alberto Moravia, a man who knew the effect of passion on human beings. <br /> <br /> The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we saw recently. The film is a must for all serious cinema fans, because we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a plausibly plausible film, something that was missing from the American version. <br /> <br /> film, it is the intensity that the director has obtained from his key actors. The magnificent Clara Calamai does an extraordinary job as Giovanna, the woman who married an older man, but when Gino appears in his life, all he wants to do is get rid of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations of Signora Calamai's successes in Italian cinema. The last sequence of the film shows Mrs. Calamai at her best in the ironic turn which acts as a moral redemption for the monstrous crime committed. <br /> <br /> Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino, the big man who awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, something that Mr. Girotti projects with such ease and refinement that he is not equaled on screen. Mr. Girotti makes the man come to life in a performance that seems so easy, but with another actor it may not have been so obvious. Juan DeLanda is seen as Joseph, the oldest man who fell in love with Joan. In fact, his character sounds truer than his counterpart in the American film, where he is seen more like a buffoon. <br /> <br /> The film is magnificently photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way Italian directors of the time favored it. The original soundtrack by Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes arias by Bizet and Verdi that fit well in the context of the film. <br /> <br /> "Obsession" is a film to be preserved because we see a great Luchino Visconti on top of his form.
