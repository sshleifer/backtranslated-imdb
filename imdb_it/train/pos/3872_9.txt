After watching this cute and funny little movie, you'll definitely feel better. Acknowledgments to Yves B. Pelletier for having given birth to this wonderful little film moment, which I think will be recognized as a marking film of the year 2004 for Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon offer a touching performance. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you those that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain gave me. So, if you like the magnificent Jean-Pierre Jeunet film, I would say that you would also like Yves B. Pelletier's first film, Les Aimants
