Before seeing this film, I see many comments, that everyone has a good view of the film good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to emphasize is the acting of Woody Harrelson By account, it may not be in many parts of the film, but when it appears or even the introduction, I was amazed by the "message" of Will Smith and Woody Harrelson that they tried to create and perhaps to slide the whole plot to the end to really understand what is happening . <br /> <br /> I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. But an act to show redemption, there are not many films that from my point of view can show this. This is one of those that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with a person who has commented on this film that shows acts of "suicide" is a ruin, however I do not think that it is the "message" that the film is trying to send, but " to sacrifice". A bit extreme, but this is the message according to MY. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. The acting is worth every penny, the script is incredible. from a person who doesn't like watching dramatic movies ... if you like drama, this is a must see.
