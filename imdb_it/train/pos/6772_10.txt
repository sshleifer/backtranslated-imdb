Unlike another user who said that this film sucked (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I disagree. <br /> <br /> This movie was fantastic !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is fantastic in everything that is inside! Yes, now it could be bigger, because many remember it from Romeo and Juliet, but it's wonderful! <br /> <br /> This plot can be used quite often, but it is a unique film and I will fight against anyone who disagrees! I liked this movie as much as any other Olivia Hussey movie. Olivia is "my girlfriend" and I love her job. <br /> <br /> I saw him for the first time Saturday (4/14/07) and I fell in love with him. Not only because it is a film by Olivia, but because of its unique plot and its wonderful direction.
