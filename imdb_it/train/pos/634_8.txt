I was one of about 200 people who was lucky enough to see a preview of this film. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan a young man looking for a shooting star and brings her back to the woman he loves to show his love for her. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a door between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This film was just a joy to watch, it has something for everyone, all the action scenes take place beautifully and the comedy is spread through the film making it fun without being trivial. If I had to compare I like with another movie, it would probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are exceptional, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love in her portrait of Yvaine the naive and trusted and undervalued star Michelle Pfeiffer gives an exceptional performance as Larnia ... but the exhibition of which talking is Robert De Niro ... In every scene where he is in low hands he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a fun fantasy love story, this is the movie. The guys don't turn off for the description, there's enough action comedy and not to mention lots of candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained all the time. Cinematography is dead and keeps the film feeling ... nothing in the film seems forced.
