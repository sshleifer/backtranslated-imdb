I saw Martin's Day for the first time when I was only 10 years old at home on The Movie Channel, and I still remember the impact it has had on my life. It touched me like no other film touched me, and I remember having my eyes opened wide. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere else. I would like to ask around and no one had ever heard of the movie! I imagine it was one of those rarer films that not many people knew, because nobody, I mean nobody, knew what I was talking about. I've searched and searched over the years, checking video store shelves and scanning cable TV listings, but it's always failed me. Finally, in 1996 I discovered that I could order it in a special way, I did it, and I probably watched it at least 50 times since then - and it makes me cry anyway. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man who is in prison (but honestly a good boy), who yearns to return to the special lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place, where he lived in nature, spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film, he escapes and begins to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long before the cops find him, and Steckert grabs a child hostage to convince the police to support off. Soon Steckert and his hostage (2nd Martin) will become best friends and have a lot of fun doing so many fun adventures: stealing a toy truck, taking a ride on a train, all traveling to this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Steckert has great flashbacks on the lake as a boy. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin the ending for you, but I'll tell you that this movie is a must see. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am, without doubt, the biggest fan of this EVER movie! I managed to find the song that the two Martins are singing throughout the film ("I'll go back, where I'm from ...). I'm also planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cottage where Martin's Day was shot Crazy, I know - but that movie just means a lot to me.
