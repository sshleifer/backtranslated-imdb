My third year French lessons have always enjoyed this movie a lot. In a multicultural high school in the city center, the film provided many topics for discussion (in French in class, but I know that many discussions went on in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to that between Protée and France. I've always said that I heard that this movie had one of the "sexiest" scenes I'd ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African American shouted: "Yes!" when he understood the scene: the one in which Protée is helping Aimée cover up her evening dress, while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. The directors use the "specular technique" when they want to focus on the inner conflict by one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students have had trouble understanding the end of the film. One suggested that one of the themes of the film was "Africanism", and that no matter how much one loved Africa or Africans, one cannot "become" African (as the driver tried to do): one must be African.
