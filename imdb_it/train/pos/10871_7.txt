Despite a close-knit narrative, Johnnie To's Election sometimes feels like it was once a longer image, with many characters and plot textures abandoned or eventually unresolved. Some of these are treated in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue, but it is still an exciting thriller about a disputed electoral triad that bypasses the usual shootout and explosions (though not violence) in favor of constantly changing alliances that can transform the time needed to make a phone call. It is also a film in which the most ruthless character is not always the most threatening, as the chilling ending makes clear: one can imagine a life of psychological counseling that is necessary for all the trauma that is inflicted on an unfortunate spectator. <br /> <br /> Simon Yam, too often a variable actor but always at his best under the direction of To, has probably never been better in the head, also because the much more extroverted performance of Tony Leung makes his calm more powerful.
