Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (in the role of Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The first taste of the world of a 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the first moments of this 1930's treasure as he crosses the screen in an angelic wedding dress. This was to be the beginning of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman who has ever graced the big screen. <br /> <br /> It is the wedding night of Eva (Lamarr) and her old husband seems not interested in her romantic advances. He retires to the solitary bed and, in a beautiful scene, fiddles with his wedding ring while the realization of his conjugal error surpasses it. The husband seems more interested in the cleanliness and order of what he loves. Gustav Machaty uses splendid camera angles and photographic shots to capture Lamarr's remarkable talent and beauty. Without words spoken in the first part of the film, he is able to grasp our understanding, our hearts and our support. It is this combination that prepared the 30s for what they were about to see while the film took place. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time ... Some thought it was outrageous. <br /> <br /> She returns home for her father's properties and seeks a divorce. The next day, he wakes up with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. He just has to go out and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a ride on horseback and happens through a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear naked in an important film. His joke in the woods and his magical adventure in the lake were legendary scandalous. But the public could not stay away. As with many of today's films, the controversy has made it a must-have movie. <br /> <br /> Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who has fled with her clothes. After an embarrassing encounter, they end up falling for each other. Their first romantic date was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does a nice job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates a delightful moment, when Eva seems to literally sink into her new lover, using a splendid early photographic makeup. <br /> <br /> It cannot be overstated how courageous this performance by Lamarr was. Many could have assumed that it was career suicide. Instead, he gained his worldwide fame and caught the eye of Louis B Mayer, who signed her for a contract with MGM. There are some really erotic moments in this film, even for the current rigid standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930s. Once again, Machaty was very intelligent with his images, leaving much to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is extremely well done. <br /> <br /> The meeting between Eva's ex-husband and his current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of this meeting are not. The film takes some unexpected turns in its final act and it's all for a great story and a nice debut on the big stage of the cinema celebrity for Hedy Lamarr. I highly recommend it, once controversial, now tame the film and push you to look for it in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling and the management is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - Reviews of TC Candler's movies !!!
