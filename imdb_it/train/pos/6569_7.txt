"Jake Speed" is a beautiful film with a wonderful message. It has its flaws, of course. Sometimes it's a bit slow. It introduces its bad too into history. The action is stimulated to the rhythm of a snail's heartbeat. He has a Z-level cast (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who looks like Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all that goes against it, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to a fascinating script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the lead role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find it so inspiring? Because he says "Hey, why not try to be a good person." <br /> <br /> History is essentially a "foreigner in a foreign land" premise, that is, the good and heroic Jake Speed ​​is inserted into the real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a boy scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, bad and bad world. <br /> <br /> That's why "Jake Speed" really needed to be a hit. He has a great message that should have come out in Hollywood and then in the rest of the world. Imagine a film industry that really pushed itself to portray good and dignified people. I'm not saying we should watch the Waltons in every theater in the cinema, but it would be nice if other films like "Jake Speed" had a chance. ("Two South", a television program on a Canadian Mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to revive American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and guns, but the general message is that if you work hard enough to be a good person, you will beat the forces of evil every time. 14/10/99
