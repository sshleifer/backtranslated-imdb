This cordial comedy addresses some bizarre characters. Above all, obviously, the two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because he couldn't stand cleaning and cooking attacks. So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an unreliable and unreliable reporter who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in a bachelor's apartment. He offers his afflicted friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the problem starts because two characters so opposed cannot live together for a long time. Felix turns Oscar's messy apartment into a clean apartment. It cleans and cooks all the time. After a while, Oscar feels the mania of persecution ... Theatrically filmed and performed excellently. Above all, the work of Jack Lemmon is wonderful. He is the perfect clown. It makes us laugh but in a tragicomic way. Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two women to dinner for dinner, because Oscar has to touch something softer than a bowling ball. While preparing the drinks, Felix sits down with the two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, start talking about the weather. A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he starts crying and when Oscar comes back with the drinks, there are three people in tears in the living room. The film is full of scenes that are so fun and moving at the same time. An intelligent and funny comedy with a lot of heart. 10 out of 10!
