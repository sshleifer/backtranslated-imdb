First of all, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with writers like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION marvelously summarizes Tolkien's universe with psychedelic 70s, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes, animation and background painting are sometimes a bit "rough" in its technical execution, but they are still beautiful and very evocative in terms of the unique "sense of place" for each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute uniqueness of the images is the absolutely exceptional vocal acting - acting that is somewhat superior to acting in new action films. And while cellular animation may not be the most "technically skilled" animation, it superbly captures the expressive gestures of the body and face of acting, without forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. Background paintings range from the traditional "fantasy" motif to total abstraction, but the transition to abstract contexts is always motivated by narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you are a person who needs to have a complete computer rendering in a movie so that everything is displayed to you, then I can see how you might not like this movie, but if you like higher acting, transcendental images and JRR Tolkien, then this film is a must see.
