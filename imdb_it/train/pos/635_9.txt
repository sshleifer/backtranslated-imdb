On July 19, I went to a small preliminary screening of this film, knowing none other than the names of some of the actors and that it was a quest for fantasy / adventure of some kind. <br /> <br /> The plot is not exactly as I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated by everything that is currently arriving or coming to the theaters. Despite what first impressions can give, it's not kitsch, banal, tacky or ridiculous, and it's actually a lot of fun and fun. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the film, instead of simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or on TV. And even though I could know what was coming to the points, I still couldn't bear to stop looking at the screen; as far as I know, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there seems to be almost no publicity for this film, and brilliant as it may be, I can't understand why
