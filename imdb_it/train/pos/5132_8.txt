Jazz fans will treasure this classic short film that shows some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing. It's like watching a no-frills music video today. <br /> <br /> The men of jazz give us an extra treat in the person of Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I had never heard her sing before, Bryant sounds extraordinarily like Billie Holliday. This is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Even their instrumental work is at the top. With the black cinema of his time nurtured by many white stereotypes, this film is to be watched and appreciated. No great production value, just a lot of good music.
