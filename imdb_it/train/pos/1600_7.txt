This is not a bad movie. It's not very funny, but it's interesting and <br /> <br /> fun. It has some fun moments. Cher gives a good <br /> <br /> performance in a role that is very opposed to her real life. His performance <br /> <br /> alone is worth the watch. If this movie came out today <br /> <br /> it wouldn't have been named, but by the standards of the 80s <br /> <br /> it was excellent.
