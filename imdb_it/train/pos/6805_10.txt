I loved this movie. It was done so well! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider's movies. This stone, not as big as Sissi but still rocks! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, commented and said the French dubbing. Well, this is originally a non-French German film. So yes Secondly, there was a plot, maybe you're not familiar with the story. Oh, and her mother played the part of her housekeeper, not her teacher. And the plot really wasn't Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway ... the story of this movie is fantastic, I love historical films and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all the historical things. Like that guy who was trying to manipulate his mother. And when she ran away, she met her future husband and he showed her the "new kind of dance" waltz. When waltzing was new, it was considered quite scandalous because couples dance so close. Yes, his housekeeper was like my god! <br /> <br /> And clothes too, I love clothes. The styles are fantastic, the circle skirts are fantastic. And obviously Romy always looks very pretty.
