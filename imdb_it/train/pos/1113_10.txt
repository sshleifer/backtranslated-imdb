Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly one of the funniest women in the world. He began in the 70s as a comic actress, but his big break came in 1983 when he starred alongside Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, "The King of Comedy". However, his film career never took off. She made a couple of strange but funny images, like "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most surprising parts were those created by herself. <br /> <br /> "Without you I'm Nothing" is without doubt his best effort. Is it an adaptation of her hugely off-Broadway show that made her a superstar? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten scenes perfectly choreographed and staged, Sandra moves from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and plays songs made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich made sure that Sandra performed a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that is both sexy and uniquely fun. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can't miss this movie; it's also a tribute to his (strange) beauty for his extremely unconventional talent as a comedian. And did it influence the directors in their work ?? "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for example, would be very different if "Without You I'm Nothing" didn't exist.
