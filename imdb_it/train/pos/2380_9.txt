I didn't mind walking. Then people really walked in places. He lent an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on Martian technology. I too was disappointed by the effects, particularly from the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this movie enough for its loyalty to the Wells story! It's almost time. The actors are nice and the performances are fascinating. Even this film deserves to be seen only to hear the soundtrack of Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London.
