I happened to take this movie in cable one afternoon. I have to admit I've never been a big baseball fan, but sometimes I can get into a good sport-related movie. What I found most interesting was the depiction of the adoptive family system. As a therapist who saw the good and bad of mental health and the community's adoptive system, I thought it was rather pleasant to see a film showing the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biological Parents don't always get active involvement and transitions can be heartbreaking and shocking. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film, and both carry very credible performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself shedding tears at the end of the film.
