Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but presents some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences in Hong Kong cinema history. Director Chang Cheh creates what is considered by many his masterpiece. This film launched the career of the five men who interpret the poisons. Meng still plays another nasty ass. He would continue to be in Super Ninja. Kuo Chui who is Philip Kwok would go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any chop fan can be applied to this. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninja (also produced by Chang Cheh). But all the chock socky is good and this is one of the best.
