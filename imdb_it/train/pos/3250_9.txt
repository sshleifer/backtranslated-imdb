Another for the crowd of Babes & Bullets. The story is much more angular than any other musical I've seen: the cannons hide the missing legs of the females and place them generatively in the other in a way that comes close to an intelligent comment of what might be expected for the venue. More effective than contemporary drama. It's hard to identify with a woman holding a cannon in her pants - plenty of leggings. Quite remarkable considering the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the leg is 90% of the surprises, this film also tells how much greed displaces every other consideration in the life of a group of yakuzas that pursue a woman who holds on one leg a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (so no scene shower group or flip-flops) The hidden projectile-thrower that is pulled out from behind the protagonists back, apparently from nowhere, in miike's Dead or Alive (1999), The torch brought out of nowhere by the heroine towards the end of the original Tomie (2000), or the harrowing scene of the flamethrowers in Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all testify to a Cantinflas-esquire almost of the third world influence in contemporary Japanese cinema, of which I cannot explain, but not I can complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see good quality films of this essence made in Hollywood, it is almost extinct and with a cheap crap pumping out for an economic thrill, it's anything but ridiculous. This is a real film and, while it is grandiose in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not entirely harmless, repercussion of certain images of Sergio Leon, which involve cannons where the legs should be, and certainly it is appropriate!
