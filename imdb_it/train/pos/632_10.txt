OK here's how I do this. Classic film on 10 components. Each component will begin intrinsically with 5 points. He can therefore lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. He had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The Romance has not been exaggerated, but it is still very exciting and moving. I laughed hard and long for the whole film, yet I was fascinated by the fantastic drama and gripping suspense. <br /> <br /> Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found myself sitting at the theater, I returned to my childhood, and at that moment I believed in unicorns again, evil witches and shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic photography - I give this component 8 points. While the film captured the story very well in most corners, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what happened a short distance from the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I like that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had EVERYTHING! Cast: I give this component 10 points. No names and expert actors, the cast was fantastic! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully evil, Charlie Cox gave birth to Tristan, Claire Danes thrilled the stars, and I will never look again and Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors have performed their roles perfectly. Once again, I will never watch MAI or Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. I felt a bit hasty and I think that if the film had been a little longer they could have made the characters a little more justice. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. Was the dialogue intelligent, witty, fun ?? also the pulp had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only a small piece of music from the entire movie. I don't complain beyond the fact that music could be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finish: give this component 9 points. Almost perfect finish! I feel that some aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others might have been more subdued, but no thread was left free. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! Watch it at the theater? Surely! Bottom Line: excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I highly recommend seeing him in the theater, I know I'll be back for seconds!
