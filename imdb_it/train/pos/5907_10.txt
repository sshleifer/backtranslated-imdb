This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and somehow I saw the life of the villagers. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects exactly the same. Full credit to the director and actor. They did an excellent job. I just wonder how films like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not Doghi. I don't understand the criteria on which the films are selected. The money that makes the difference or has big names in the film makes the difference. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more movies like this in the future.
