More like the psychological analysis of films, but Psycho sounds better as a header. The man in charge of the film (the narrator, if you want) describes the films here in his own way. Many of them are classics, but they are all listed here on IMDb and I highly recommend seeing them (especially the films of Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation and Lynch), because Slavoj Zizek will refer to them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, it could ruin them for you. I don't remember if he ruined more than the ones I listed (I also think about Chaplin's films), but as I wrote it would be better if you look at them all in advance! In the IMDb list there is a missing movie, which I reported to them, so it may be coming soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's still just a brief snippet of a deal. <br /> <br /> Zizek's views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you are open to seeing things through another perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie a little for you ... does not mean that it will, but could)!
