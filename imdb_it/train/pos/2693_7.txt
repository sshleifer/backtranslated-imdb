Even if the plot is essentially routine, and the "surprise" ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles that good actors can shine , and make them shine The film is done flawlessly for the time being. It was redone in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you want to see only one version of the story (that's all it really deserves), I recommend it, with the updated Hopkins direction and the most explicit plot point references to which the original could only suggest. The finish, however, continues to hit. (** 1/2)
