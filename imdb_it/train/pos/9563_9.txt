First of all I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely sexy and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I've seen so far; shows a background of poverty of a Cambodian lifestyle. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes around killing people to survive himself; he did it all his life. Sam Lee's (Wai) duty is to capture the Cambodian forever. There are tons of violent actions but it has a good story. The film shows the struggles between these two characters; both beat like angry dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGESTED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
