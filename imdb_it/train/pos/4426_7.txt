I'm glad I saw this movie having seen some of the director's other films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were fantastic like the costumes and the settings with the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were managed. I agree with some of the other comments on the fighting scenes. Sometimes they were difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> After all, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers think of the film. It's a film I'd like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like those where Benkai and the Prince were fighting on a "psychic" level were well done. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinema thinking about what just happened here. Intense.
