What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and the sects who adore sirens? Tobe Hooper tries to answer this question in a strange little film. Genie is a young girl who visits her nerdy father of archeology in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie is captured by a mysterious prostitute (and a cheeky lesbian) who helps Dad on the side. Dad is sent back to the site, where he discovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with a massive Egyptian (providing the hottest scenes in the film). In the end, Genie discovers that she will be a sacrifice and the prolonged and bloody climax will go on. Around this story is the video of the Marquis de Sade in prison, speaking with a portrait of Genie. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is exceptional both as a Marquis and as a descendant. His acting skills have always been swept away by his makeup needs, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including the young Genie, is cute and average. The script, however, is problematic. You will soon discover that the Marquis's scenes are completely useless, except perhaps that the directors had access to the set. The siren sect that ultimately saves Genie makes absolutely no sense. Who is the mermaid is never explained, and her connection with Christianity (which is exaggerated throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, as the archaeologist is a father who makes the bibles spurt, but he loves being tied by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of debauchery and violence, but Hooper probably had no idea what the writers were trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> So why am I recommending this movie? It's strange. There is an extended sex scene. For women, the Egyptian Hunky rides a completely naked horse. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This film is full of them. This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowing Hooper somehow invented "Crocodile" after this is rather sad. "Night Terrors" is not perfect, but it certainly deserves a winking and inconspicuous look. <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for physical violence, sexual assault, cold bloodedness, obscenities, female nudity, male nudity, sex content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
