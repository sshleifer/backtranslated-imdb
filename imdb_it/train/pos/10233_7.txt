I've always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them couldn't meet my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor of most HK films, nor a second-level plot that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are there just to fill an "intelligent" space (the only truly intelligent martial arts film I saw is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is not a real Hong Kong movie for me). There are some incredible fighting scenes in this movie, from the first (which is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! But be careful, there is also a lot of blood flowing (people cut in half, beheaded, etc.). The production is quite good and the special effects show that the writer's imagination can be satisfied even if some shots have to be rather technical (note: the sheet of paper he throws and is blocked in a wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite Hong Kong movie, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure I'll go see more from this director! Ace.
