I wish films for children were still made this way; dark and deep. There was (take this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character), plot development, superb animation, emotional involvement and a rational, relatable and coherent theme. If it weren't for the handful of song-and-dance routines, you'd never have thought it was a children's movie, and that's why it gives me such a high grade. This film is an excellent film, let alone a children's film. Which brings me to the second point: this must be the darkest "children" movie I've seen in a while, which comes from a twenty-two year old. I would be shocked to see every child under the age of 8 not completely terrified for much of the second half and part of the first half of the film, and everything ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever meet ("Jurassic Bark" wing, those of you who are fans of "Futurama"), and this is what makes this movie so beautiful. Just because the film universally evokes emotions that normally do not like to hear and assume are bad, does not make the film itself bad; in fact it means that he succeeded. Good fun movies should make us laugh; good horror movies should frighten us; good sad films should make us sad. My point is that good movies should MOVE you, not just entertain; this film moved me. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film is incredibly violent by today's standards for a children's movie and contains topics that may not be suitable for some children by today's standards. Parents, I'd say watch it first. I don't usually say anything about this kind of thing, but I saw it yesterday and it was a surprise for me too.
