The film is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But did you expect a high-level intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's acting is not exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I certainly liked the film. Was he anywhere near the level of the fantastic that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Was it really fun if you're just considering it? Absolutely. It's a film about some Chinese idols and musicians who know how to play basketball with an unreal level of experience. There is an evil Triad-style dude and a bizarre intriguing man who brings Jay Chou to all this. A love interest It is terrific, but really, to suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you've signed up for? Do yourself a favor if you look at it - I found a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie almost unintelligible with regards to conversations, but we had a good laugh. They seem to be extremely fixed on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I hurled. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for that bar scene. Well choreographed and well filmed. I especially like the illuminated plexiglass billiard table - I'd like to play on one of these. <br /> <br /> Pretty polished for me, but I like trash cinema.
