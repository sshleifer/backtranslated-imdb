This was one of the DVDs I bought recently in a set of six called "Frenchfilm" to brush up on our French before our planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year. So far, in addition to improving our French, we have greatly improved our appreciation for French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air for the stale, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drivel that is churned out by Hollywood. What a good example for scriptwriters, actors, directors and filmmakers to follow. It was also so inspiring to see two identifiable characters in the main roles without them having to be the cover of glossy magazines. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about this film was the slowness of the character and the build up of plot that made you realize how it would end. Is there any real good in this selfish hooligan who continually treats his apparently naive benefactor with the kind of contempt that an ex-convict would exhibit? Will the poor half-deaf heroine, sexually frustrated, prove the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The viewer is fascinated by these questions and the actors reveal the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feelings towards each other. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen this movie, like me you might want to see it again. I still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the plot in the role of probation officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work deserve a second look. The plot requires a little imagination when our hero is given the opportunity to assist our abused and outraged heroine in the office. You also need to have a generic mentality to believe in his brilliant lip reading and as part of the action he sits in his place. But if you go on the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best, you will come out more than satisfied. Four out of five stars for me.
