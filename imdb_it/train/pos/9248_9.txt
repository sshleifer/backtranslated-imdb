Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, a working class girl from Brooklyn who falls in love with con man Clark Gable and finds himself in trouble of all kinds. The film begins as his film, but when the emphasis is over it definitely passes to his character. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Gable shooting a street game with his partner, Garry Owen and the brand that screams for the cops. While chasing Gable Duck in Harlow's apartment and being such a charming guy, she protects him. <br /> <br /> In a short time you are involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to launch a badger game on a drunk Paul Hurst, but then Gable won't. Obviously, when Hurst realizes he was a scam, he is still in pain and becomes belligerent and Gable has to punch him. But then he finds himself dead outside Harlow's apartment and that platinum blonde hair makes it easy to identify. Goes on an accomplice for manslaughter. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is his and his adaptation to life in prison. Her interaction with the other inmates offers her some very beautiful scenes. I think part of the material was later used for the Caged classic MGM. <br /> <br /> Harlow is also able to make the title song and is made like a torch-style ballad, very popular in those days. He speaks / sings in the way of Sophie Tucker and quite well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well chosen as a scammer who develops a conscience, a part he often played, particularly in my favorite film Gable, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> Again it is Harlow who gets to shine in this film. I think it's one of the best he's done at MGM, his fans shouldn't lose it.
