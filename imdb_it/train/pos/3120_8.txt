Paul Greengrass has definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complaining about the way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? Come on, it wasn't bad at all. I think it helps action scenes feel more realistic, which I would prefer to a highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the film, I didn't even notice. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Damon really adapted to the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it's really a good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this episode. Damon also has a large supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is full of great car chases and non-stop actions, they have managed to maintain a good deal of character development in theirs with everything that's happening. This film is well above the other two Bourne films and is certainly one of the best films of the 2007 summer season!
