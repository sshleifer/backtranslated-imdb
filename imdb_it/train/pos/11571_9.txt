"An Itch In Time" is one of the domestic sequences that Bob Clampett struck for WB in the early 1940s, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wins By A Hare". Impregnated with manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it is basically the saga of a flea that is busy breaking ground for a new home, and the dog whose land has been broken. Since the master Elmer will give him a terrible flea bath if he is so scratched, the unfortunate dog is forced to endure a spiral of torment upward while the house flea uses axes and power tools to rid the earth. In the end, the little monster lights the fuse on a small mountain of high-powered explosives that is piled on the backside of his victim! There is a tremendous explosion, and the unfortunate dog covers his eyes as his rear bursts into a display explosion on July 4th! This must really hurt, and the dog takes flight, but soon interrupts the action and says with a cheerful smile, "Guys, it's better to cut it off, because I think it's starting to like it!" For years this vicious confession has been censored, but current prints have restored the clip, so viewers can now enjoy it in its original devilish glory. Still cut, however, is the closing gag in which the cat opens his brain after he complains: "Now I've seen it all!" This was a gag common to WB, but has since been eliminated from this cartoon and many others, including "Horton".
