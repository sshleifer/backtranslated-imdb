This film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not. Take your time. Relax, have fun. To think. People who see this film as slow, tiring or boring really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention mind takes the chance to get involved in a lawsuit or even a beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because you don't hurry to make the points you need so much to do it in the short time allotted. At first I was apprehensive about Brosnan playing a Native American. Given the plot, I think it was the right casting. Now, let's get back to my hermitage. -Jahfre
