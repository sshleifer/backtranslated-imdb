Without a doubt, this film must be one of the greatest ........ in the history of cinema. I've seen too many times to remember, and every time it's like watching the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? <br /> <br /> The performance of Meena Kumari's central is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful of her career, followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool Aur Pathar. Every movement and nuance of his performance makes any other Bollywood heroine pale in meaning. His masterful interpretation of Kathak combined with his grace, his tragic vulnerability and his poetic delivery of Urdhu, is like nothing ever seen on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, the sumptuous cinematography and the staging are so full of symbolism and meaning, that the spectator is breathless. <br /> <br /> Naushads music is unsurpassed, his knowledge of gharana courtiers' music is incredible and the way he punctuates the narrative with dark weather patterns and overwhelming romantic melodies is truly remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who seriously appreciates the spectacle of total cinema, should look at this epic mediation on life and art.
