It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to take advantage of it and take a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the little son can help him get out of this - while the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and seeks help. <br /> <br /> The short film by John Sturges (69 minutes) is powerful due to unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price he has to pay for it. There is a double question that the film poses. How far would you go to help the man you love, and on the other hand - observing Stanwyck's behavior towards the unknown - does he really love his husband? Like a good news, this film leaves the viewer with questions that he can only answer to himself.
