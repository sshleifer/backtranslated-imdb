The National Gallery of Art showed the original full version of this long-lost film on July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes cut by the censors upon release. The character of the cobbler, an individual of moral benevolence in the original censored version of 1933, is presented here as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and urges him to use men to reach the top. Furthermore, the end frame of the original, which I assume is in the current VHS versions, is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. We hope there will be a reprint of this DVD movie for all those who appreciate its great qualities. Look for it.
