I saw this movie and the comedy, and I must add that this was the most moving story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie I was not aware of how horrible life was and probably still is for the children and adults of South Africa who lived and were living at that time. It brought tears to my eyes and a lot of sadness for my heart that every human being should fight in that way just to survive, and to take the children out of that area and teach them to act and preform and move them away to say their story is simply amazing. This simply exceeds five stars, I consider it a ten. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. Although 12 years have passed since this story was told, it is still a heavy thing in my heart. If there is a VHS, or a DVD out there on the game, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you. PS There was nothing wrong with the children who wanted to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in the hope that someone had a heart and offered assistance.
