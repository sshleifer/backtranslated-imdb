Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes to create a good movie thriller. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former district attorney, Kate Capshaw and a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother, Ruby Dee, closes Connery's eyelet at a conference and convinces him to manage her nephew's appeal. He's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural Florida county, he clashes with a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne who is ruthless in his crime resolution as Orson Welles was in Touch of Evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery discovered the verdict with the evidence discovered, he feels rather good about himself. At that point the film takes a decisive turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> Saying that not all that it seems is to put it lightly. The cast spins some good performances evenly. A special mention goes to Ed Harris who plays Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer on death row with Underwood. It will make your skin crawl and start making sure that Connery reviews some of those comfortable liberal bases on which he based his beliefs. Many confirmed liberals I met came out thinking differently once they became a victim of a crime. Obviously the opposite is equally true. Many law and order conservatories, if they are ever involved in the wrong part of the criminal justice system, want to be sure that all their rights are effectively guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and an endless one for the whole of society. I suppose Just Cause has a moral that probably would be.
