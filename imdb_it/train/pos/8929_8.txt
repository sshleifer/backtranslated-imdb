First of all, I really liked the central idea of ​​locating the "intruders", the others in the fragile Self, at various levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical. In reality the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film: in the French-Swiss border where the pre-protagonist leads an isolated life; in his dream with open eyes and the recurring nightmare; inside his sick body after the heart transplant ... In the last half of the film, he himself becomes an intruder, returning to the ancient French colony in the hope of expiating the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regrets and guilt, the sense of failure is more or less dominant. This is a rather gloomy image of an old age, apparently self-dependent, but hopelessly empty and lonely inside. The director composes the images more to convey the passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meaning. Some of them are hypnotizing, not without humor, a kind of absurd game that only the sleepwalker can visualize.
