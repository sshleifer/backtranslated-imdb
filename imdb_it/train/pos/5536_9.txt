Actually I really enjoyed this show. Even as a young man I was interested in all sports and that included horse racing. It would have always been difficult to create a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the tracks to record the filming of this controversial topic. An episode that I remember particularly focused on a horse expected to win a great race that seemed a bit off color. A syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought she had been drugged, but nothing came up in the blood tests. Too late they realized that the horse had not been drugged but had removed the cartilage of the knee. Like driving a car without oil and the engine crashing, the horse broke with tragic consequences.
