I could write a fairly large commentary on any of the Gundam Wing characters, everyone could lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead we get 8 fantastic leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of Anime beat. <br /> <br /> It contains dialogues that you can roll over your head for months ... years, and then go back and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in writing scripts (even if it has the typical Anime trait of being disparity between subtitles and English dubbing). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your points of view. <br /> <br /> Relations between insensitive males and loving female figures are an independent aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch. The apparent rejection of the male is supported by an inner turmoil that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women needed for them in their harsh military environment. Women are chasing aspects of men that rarely, if at all, make leading men even more enigmatic. He brings all 49 episodes to Heero to show some thoughtfulness, but he gets there and, when he does, it's a great reward. <br /> <br /> And then there's the giant robot fight. Fun to watch fantastic sequences like any epic Hollywood fight scene. Any less shrewd person would see the giant robot fight like a stupid children's cartoon feature, as it became clear when I'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. Many of the giant robot fights in Gundam Wing contain a strong dose of pathos, usually about young rebels who struggle for what they believe against an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> The constant changes of tone and emphasis throughout each episode, making Gundam Wing impossible to bore, is an engaging and challenging study of the potential of the mind and the human body.
