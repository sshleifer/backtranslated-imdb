Recently, a friend and I discussed educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950s and today. He quoted Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner in 1798. Both were required to recite parts of the epic in high school and in English literature courses in college. My friend said: "His messages could also be called metaphysical in today's context". <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and only to remember pieces and pieces. (I have trouble remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I would get two copies of the poem so that everyone could read it. It was pretty easy, but I was extremely surprised to find that it had been turned into a movie. We couldn't wait to watch the movie to see how it was played. After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly a light read. After reading the poem, we saw the film together. <br /> <br /> We considered the film a remarkable achievement, especially considering that it was made in the 1970s, before computers, before the so-called "Ken Burns" effect and before the special effects started too often in compensate for the lack of substance Particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations selected by "lesser-known artists", such as Willy Pogany, the first Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, who had taught the poem when he was a school teacher, adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining faithful to the poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery is in the layers of subtle messages, transmitted without " instructions, "or becoming a story of overwhelming and obvious morality. We found it a change so refreshing compared to today's mentality" in the face "and" deceiving the head. "Most of today's morality messages in the film are bid dimensions: extreme violence, murder and criminality mark evil. The bad guys are really, really bad, and the superheroes are good. It is as if the human character had no nuance. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, of character, of an appreciation to celebrate all the riches that life has to offer, in the broader context of humanity, that is man's ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud of ourselves for having found this gem "unknown", we later learned that it had won the first prize in its category five times out of six on the occasion of "nominating" international film festivals. Another surprise was the learning of the film's director, Raul da Silva, an authority recognized in the early animations and the author of six award winning books on cinema. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is just as current today, if not more so, than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and when Raul da Silva translated it into film. If I still taught high school, which I did for five years, I would take it and show it to all my students. There is a level of wealth here that naturally leads to the discussion of the great and important questions we all face, whether in 1798, 1978 or today - in reality, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
