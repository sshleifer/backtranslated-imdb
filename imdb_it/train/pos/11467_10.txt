This is the best film I've met in a long time. Not only is this the best film of its kind (shooting school) The way in which Ben Coccio (the director) decided to film was magnificent. He shot it using teenage actors who were still in high school. He shot it in the actors' rooms and used the actors as real parents in the film. Even the actors were filming using video cameras making it look much more like a video diary. He's almost skilled (if it's really a word) However, there are some slides, for example when Cal calls brads (?) Land rover a range rover (or vice versa, it's been a while since I last saw him )
