The manic desire of Adolf Hitler to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second series of seven-part films produced by the US War Department as a teaching tool for new soldiers entering the Armed Forces during the second World War. Hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived, starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding into the heart of Europe, and then moving to the Island of the World made up of Europe, Asia and Africa. His final move would be to reach across the oceans the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, while the rest of the country fell under its evil spell. Primary school children sang their praises and young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. Unchallenged in Austria in 1938, Hitler followed by annexing a strip of land on the border with Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler brought all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was stunned to learn that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with deadly enemy Russia, a ploy to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately afterwards, Germany invaded Poland, bringing the conquest of Hitler just outside Russia. He would have dealt with her later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's push across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous declaration that he said "Peace in our time". It didn't happen that way. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information to be learned in this episode, at least for me, was provided by a small fragment of footage from a German gathering of Hitler in the mid-30s. He was led by a German American who took his cue directly from the motherland. The venue - Madison Square Garden!
