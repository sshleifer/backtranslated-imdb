This docu-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": magnificently photographed, chastely embellished, well written in the measured and literal way that Hollywood has discarded in the 1930s and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, excellent in its interpretation of the Native American (or, more appropriately for its Canadian setting, "First Nations") culture and standing with "Black Robe" as a beautifully photographed piece of Canoe Country and the its culture (here, around 1934). This idyllic portrait derives the drama from his subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scottish grown up in Hastings (England) from unmarried aunts who became so obsessed with "red Indian" tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared in woods, and became a hunter and adopted son of a band from Ojibway. He was a vain man with the habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, neither of whom seems to have thought less of him, because he was also an extraordinarily fascinating and picaresque character. One of his wives (more intelligent than he, according to most accounts) brought him to fame as a writer and first advocate for the protection of the wild country of the North, and this is the core of Attenborough's tale. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (like the wife of Gray Owl, Pony) is addictive and, if not fiery, it is still quite moving. A good movie when you need some time from the crazy crowd.
