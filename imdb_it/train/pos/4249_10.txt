Whether they are three boys in their tight-whitey who beat up with a guy tied up in a string or a girl who says "How's it going, dog?" to a piece of roadkill, there is something for everyone in Knuckleface Jones. It is strange and surreal and not entirely a completely comprehensible yarn ... yet it never loses you. The first time I saw him, I almost laughed. And every night after I came home and looked again. Forget Coyote Ugly ... this is the film that cemented my crush on Piper Perabo. Look at it ... before it's too late!
