I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 in a drive-in theater with my family. <br /> <br /> So, I thought it was a lot of fun. . . even though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful film such a pleasure! I saw him again this morning on "Turner South". As I watched him, I was absolutely shocked with laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic of a bygone era. If you are too young to have experienced the enchanting period of history that produced this film, I am very sorry for you. There is no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) offer a delicious corner of paradise to the "old days" like me. <br /> <br /> That said, all I can do is respectfully ask young people to refrain from commenting on movies like "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Films like this were created for the generation that preceded your current group of people. And as such, these films speak a language very different from what any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? if you don't understand the problems that the film is facing, please don't embarrass yourself by offering comments that ?? frankly ?? it does not make sense.
