James J. Corbett, world heavyweight champion from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be the favorite role of Errol Flynn. Perhaps because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western. He grew tired of the bullies and said in his autobiography that he felt he was a mixture in westerns and could not understand why people liked him in them. It's a funny film, but hardly tells the true story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As interpreted, Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a man who used brain and speed more than brute force to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost the heavyweight crown to Bob Fitzsimmons. He was also a compulsive womanizer and in that he was very similar to the man who portrayed him. Obviously it was not shown on the screen. The character played by Alexis Smith, the daughter of the banker who falls in love with him, has no basis in reality. Corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both his wives. <br /> <br /> Although after losing the title and after the events of this film ended, he suffered a great personal tragedy. His father in a moment of depression, probably beyond finances because he lost heavily by betting on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself. Murder / suicide does not square with the happy clan that Alan Hale presided over. <br /> <br /> But I liked one thing for Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond took the lead role in his life as John L. Sullivan. The director Raoul Walsh got a great performance from Bond as the bold but lovable Sullivan. Even given some of Sullivan's critical points that do not reach the screen as rabid racism, the portrait of Bond is the quintessence of John L. and the best thing about Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing what he should have said was that Sullivan while the champion refused for race reasons to meet Peter Jackson who was black and from Australia and probably the best of weights maximums of his time. I say probably because as a challenger Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds in a draw. That fight more than any other has created a demand for a Sullivan-Corbett game. Of course when Corbett was champion, he refused to give Jackson a title shot. Maybe he didn't want another 61-round marathon with someone who could have been better on that particular day. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim is not the story of Jim Corbett, it is a film by Errol Flynn that plays to be James J Corbett. But Corbett had been alive in 1942 without a doubt he would have loved the movie and loved the portrait of Flynn of his life. It's like he wanted to be remembered.
