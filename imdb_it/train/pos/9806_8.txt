I agree that Capital should be on DVD. I saw this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see the Americans working abroad in London in the financial sector to change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he was in. I can't believe the show lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's charming and opulent friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or during breaks. The show lasts less than an hour. I thought this show should have lasted longer, but the casting changes in the second season made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care about Sylvia but I missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I heard that this show took opportunities and often worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or trying to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I enjoyed watching Julia Ormond in a youthful role. I heard that this show should have lasted longer. Sometimes I heard that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a success in America.
