After watching this movie, I feel like I know a little more about the United States. David Lynch is synonymous with shock and strange value for strangeness's sake, and in fact these elements are not missing from The Straight Story. However it is in a light that I have never seen before from Lynch. We start with a simple family that lives a quiet life but end up with a series of absurdly interesting characters with a depth in their lives that cannot be evident from their introduction. Particularly moving was the bar scene with two World War II veterans who discussed the events of fifty years ago and how it influenced their lives and current emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here. But if you are looking for real people with true stories this is the movie for you.
