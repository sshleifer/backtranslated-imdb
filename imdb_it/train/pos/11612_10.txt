Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what must have been for Japanese men brought to Hawaii at the turn of the nineteenth century to work in sugar cane fields. Most came to plan to return home, but few ever managed to do so. Equally moving is the fate of Japanese women, some as young as fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as brides promises to men they knew only through photographs that were often out of date for 10 or 15 years, or were from some other young man. . They too worked hard in the fields, fighting nostalgia and preserving their dignity. <br /> <br /> The director Hatta has portrayed the courage and perseverance of a bride who struggles to survive in a strange land and an alien society under great physical violence is ultimately inspiring and uplifting - a story of moral and cultural survival. There is a magnitude and magnificence of the character's breadth and landscape in Picture Bride that captures the seductive beauty and violent harshness of colonial Hawaii. This is an emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding film.
