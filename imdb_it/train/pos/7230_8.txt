"The Invisible Mouse" is a delicious and different cartoon by Tom & Jerry. Presents the usual cat / mouse pursuits and battles, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls into a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very happy with this because he realizes that he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, frighten him, torment him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As strange as it is, it's also very nice and fun to see what we can't see: invisible Jerry. It's fun to see things rise up in the air without seeing who is doing it (we know who, right?) - it's as if those things had a life of their own or even almost a matter of ghosts. It's also fun to see Jerry eating some candy and fruit while he is invisible. I really like that instrumental music that plays when it's not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes about this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams it and even when Tom tries to slam it with a pan and Jerry writes "I missed him". I also like it when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face. <br /> <br /> In general, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, fun, fun and some beautiful works of art too.
