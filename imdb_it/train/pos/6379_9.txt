The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a sparkling gem among the ruins of films recently produced by Disney Studios. Parents who have had to sit through "The Jungle Book 2" or even a Pokemon movie will surely enjoy this. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few to attempt an original story; the previous films were just re narratives of existing stories. Movies like "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." all do the same, but it should be noted that all were made by Pixar and distributed only by Disney. The recent films by Disney Studios are mostly published directly on video and are the sequel to a successful film. The quality of those films is sold to profitability. A new era has begun with "Atlantis", followed by "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and, more recently, "Open Range". Writers have created all the original stories instead of fairy tales from the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the film is dedicated to the search for Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. Including that of the young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed in a museum in Washington DC. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had dedicated his life to the discovery of Atlantis. This was seen as a refusal by his peers, and they want Milo not to follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum's board of directors to sponsor his expedition, Milo returns home to find a woman in his dark apartment. He takes it to his employer, a Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's grandfather and wanted to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and has paid the best of everything. The crew that must accompany him is the same as his grandfather's. The journey is full of great obstacles to overcome and is very fun to watch. The spectator will find himself involved if he reaches Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. It is sufficient to maintain the interest of the older public. <br /> <br /> The animators did a great job in the depths of the animation. The film is very successful in combining traditional animation with computer-generated images. A feat not easily obtainable, most of the public immediately realizes the difference between the two. The characters are credibly human. There are some Chase-type scenes, with many actions in progress. Some breaks are full of jokes that children may not have. <br /> <br /> The creativity of writers really transpires. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Credible, if from a younger audience, that magic really exists. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magical, but they can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although set in 1914, the level of technology used is unrealistic. The journey is in a submarine that is very reminiscent of the nautilus of Captain Nemo, complete with submarines that fire torpedoes. The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers, so they tried for some of the technology of the time. Female characters have power in a way that women of age would not have been, even taking command roles. This is not a bad thing. It provides a good reference model for my daughter, rather than an all-male cast. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons this film is my favorite compared to other Disney movies is that there is not a single song, ever. A tradition started with the first feature film, "Snow White", and continued until "The Lion King", almost all Disney movies are full of happy songs. This is fantastic and everything, what would the Seven Dwarfs be without "Hi HO!"? After the millionth time it would be almost better without it, but this saves the parent. Not once every single person on the screen suddenly knows the words of a song that nobody has ever heard before and breaks out into a song. I am grateful for the first time. <br /> <br /> The texture and depth of the animation will surely ensure the attention of both parents and children. It is a film that I am willing to watch again and again with my children.
