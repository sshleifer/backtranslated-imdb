I didn't expect much when I saw the DVD cover for the first time. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story began, it took place in a beautifully photographed and stimulated film. I was surprised and happy about this (basically) true story. It made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means the director realized his purpose and the film was a success!
