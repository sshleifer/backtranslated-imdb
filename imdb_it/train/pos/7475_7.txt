After reading some rather negative points of view for this film, I wasn't sure if I had to pay money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if it's better than that, I'd be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a good interpretation of the apparently unstable David, convincing me that it is more than a smile on his feet (only for the third time in his career - the other examples were Magnolia and Nati on July 4th ). Penelope Cruz is slightly light but meets the demands of her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the mildly bland Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it's not the acting that really impresses - it's filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe excels in the role of director, providing a welcome change of pace from his usual schecco. The film's growing madness is perfectly performed by Crowe (the short sequence in which Cruise crosses an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of a Crowe film) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a spectator. The plot seems a little forced, but the problems explored behind it are infinitely questionable. The film is not perfect, but it is a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those who grew up on a Hollywood diet, it should be a revelation.
