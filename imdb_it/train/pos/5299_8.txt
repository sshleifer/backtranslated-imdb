Once the film's title is passed, "Pecker" is a great film, perhaps one of the best of John Waters. A wonderful cast, driven by strong interpretations of Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, make the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for small children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately this film was not mass produced and the majority of the public will be denied the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity knocks, go see this movie.
