I don't want to spoil the content to anyone, who hasn't seen this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollak yet. <br /> <br /> A world-famous orchestra conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by returning to his childhood village. The villagers, who have followed the genius in silence, are slowly trying to share his greatness. <br /> <br /> Each role in this film has a very specific purpose and shows considerable potential in each of the actors to play their own accord with short but precise words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> Not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each of which reveals its own present history, their needs, their skeletons, the their wishes and much more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose plays are interpreted in unforgettable harmonies of response emotions. They touch each other with a pain related to their disability to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is really tested here in a very difficult configuration, in one of those movies that end up being catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic has become from beginning to end, not a second less or more than enough, it remains a feeling of change and a taste for more. <br /> <br /> To date, certainly one of the best films I have had the pleasure of watching.
