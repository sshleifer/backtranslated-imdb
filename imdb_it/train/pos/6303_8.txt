After listening to pretty positive reviews and seeing the trailer, I had to watch this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present that it had to be good. And delivered. Overall, the film is not funny, but there is a scene that really stands out and is, in my eyes, a classic. SPOILER In the end, where they break through the wall to reach the safe and see that Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter it's just fantastic. This is as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski, where The Dude uses a chair to barricade his door, but he forgets that the door turns outward! FINE SPOILER Just go and see this movie, you won't be disappointed.
