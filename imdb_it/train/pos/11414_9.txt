A great plot with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is hilarious as "coach" and Richard de Klerk superbly plays the role of "Carmine". Mischa Barton in the role of "Frankie" stages a good performance and Ingrid in the role of "Hazel" plays her first role extremely well. This film is masterfully directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The assembly is of first quality.
