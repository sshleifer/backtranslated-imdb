This movie is good. Not the best of CG Kung Fu's great movies, but it's pretty good. First, the story is actually good. The whole idea of ​​gods against fallen gods is about superpowers is pretty interesting. My problem is that there are too many characters! He became very confused when they changed the scenes! The special effects were AMAZING! The fighting scenes were very fast and complex. This movie practically everything computer generated. The acting is superb, as always expected by players of such high profile. Ekin Cheng is an excellent protagonist, a solitary character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this film. I thought she'd have a bigger part, but she did a fight scene and a lot of barking. The villain, the whole army of skulls and the whole cloud of blood is very scary. The music is also excellent. For me this story deserves at least a mini series and not just ONE film. There is too much history to fill in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of history for action. I recommend Storm Rider on this every day.
