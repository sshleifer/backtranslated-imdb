There are few comedies like this, in which almost all the lines and characters all come together perfectly. This is really fun !! And he has a lot of satire there. Sally Field is a leader in the field of truly exceptional actors and does a great, if not perfect, job with her daytime tv-diva. Sometimes his acting is just a little too wide and exaggerated, but 90% of the time it's a revolt! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately has too little to do here). Downey jr may not completely convince him as a comedian and he doesn't always have the right moment, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty in the role of Celeste, a real bitch if there is ever one with more than one bad secret (you'll see it in the absolutely stunning final!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems to be comfortable enough. I normally like Mrs. Shue, but here she acts like a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie. But it is not something harmful and for the most part it is at least adequate. Otherwise, overflowing with memorable lines and situations, it's a comedy to watch when it's on TV or anywhere.
