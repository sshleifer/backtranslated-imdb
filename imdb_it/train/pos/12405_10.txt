Caught this movie in 1990 or so by video and without knowing what was waiting for me. Many horror fans may have missed this thought thinking it was a typical prison movie and they didn't like it because it wasn't what they wanted to see. The factors mentioned above are probably the reasons why it is low, but ignore it and give it a whirl if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> He has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and to the prison itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a film that I still have on video to date. Check it out.
