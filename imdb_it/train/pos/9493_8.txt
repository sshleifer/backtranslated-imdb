The white fire has so much to do. With the look-alike of Larry Bird, Robert Ginty, who leads the charge with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache, the film flies over other low-budget players. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. With Ginty beating everyone, the film suddenly rises when a story of diamond intrigue comes into play. Then add Fred Williamson, some frontal bushes, chainsaw attacks and some fantastic incest themes ... this movie ends up being delivered to all cylinders. If you are looking for a fantastic B-Action, this is where it is. Now, if I can get my hands on that soundtrack.
