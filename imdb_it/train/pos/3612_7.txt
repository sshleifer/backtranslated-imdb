Michelle Rodriguez is a well-structured high school student who discovers she has a powerful punch and starts amateur training in a Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely bigger than her, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex Santiago was ordered to save him for his next meeting. <br /> <br /> Both are participants in a "gender-blind" athletic program that makes no distinction between males and females, a misguided attempt to level the athletic field. <br /> <br /> A conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I'm not making it up - "Let's face it, the president is black." I'm here to make an equally perceptive remark - "Men and women are different". Now, in 99 cases out of 100, this should not make any difference in physical performance. But in the one percent higher - trained athletes whose skills have been subtly refined - men generally have the advantage. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have greater muscle mass and strength than the upper part of the trunk. These differences in body building allow women to give birth and raise children and men to capture and kill food for them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection. Without it, there may not be any man. And this, boys and girls, is why they have men's events and women's events at the Olympics. I'm talking to you as your anthropologist. They will be ten cents, I prefer PayPal. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this blind program. How talented a boxer like Rodrigues is, as he approaches the zenith of the game, he will eventually lose to a male. <br /> <br /> Here is where the complication arises in this film. Rodrigues is finally paired with his boyfriend, Douglas. Neither of them wants to lose the anger from the other, not to mention the rights of the roundhouse, but the pride of both is at stake, and pride is both personal and linked to the genre. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what he sees as his condescending attitude. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from the movie. I thought it would be a rip-off of "Million Dollar Baby" by Clint Eastwood until I found out that it had been released years ago. And I had never heard of the director or any of the artists. That kind of darkness generally favors mischievous cries for television and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised how this result was put together. The complete absence of bathos left me speechless. So he made the minimum use of boxing clich√©s: the worn ropes, the blood, the swollen eye cut, the battered faces after the meeting, the fat and sweaty spectator who shouted "Kill him!", The landing at the nose is slow, the spray of sweat from the battered head, the heroic music that signals the expected apotheosis of the winner. None of this here - well, almost none. The entire plot could be considered formulaic. A difficult boy finds an outlet in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling that remains is that it is probably more or less what these amateur races are like. Different from those we see on TV and in ordinary films. No bell rings, for example, instead a dancing referee and observer shouts "Stop!" And "Box!" Competitors wear headgear. The gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering spectators, but only by a handful of people who have a particular interest in the future. It is a clean film, despite the rather gloomy setting and the unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez may look pretty, with her muscular mass and shining eyes under her lowered forehead, but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you in any moment when he wants, and once you feel the feminine contours of his super segmentals, it's not bad. (A scene where he fights his father on the ground is exaggerating.) It was a bit difficult to understand Douglas's reserve when Rodriguez crawled over him in bed. The director, Karyn Kusama, has carefully chosen his talent. <br /> <br /> Show what you can do with talent, imagination and a minimum of money. There should be more films like this. Take one of those multi-billion-dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or spaceships and spread generosity a little.
