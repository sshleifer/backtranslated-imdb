"Still Crazy" is without doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time. It was mistakenly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap", to which it has no relation. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and frankly, it's not a good idea, despite being "the release" of many rock clich√©s). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You worry about people in "Still Crazy". This is all that matters. Oh, yes, even the music is damn beautiful, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American public already knew Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but only later would he become familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter films).
