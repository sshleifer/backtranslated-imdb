Normally I don't like the series at all. They are all predictable and tend to get boring and boring very quickly. <br /> <br /> However, these series are well played, the story follows through all the episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be gripping you. <br /> <br /> The episodes are all filmed in a hospital and take you further and further into the mysteries of the dark and ancient secrets that lie just below the surface of the powerful hospital.
