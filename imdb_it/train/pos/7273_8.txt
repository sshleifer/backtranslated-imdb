Carlos Mencia was excellent, this is special for now. He was working hard to show everyone that it was the real deal. I know people said that he stole material in this special, but it's not true. Carlos brings up the comedy in the way he wants it, not how others want it, that's why he's so good. People say it's not funny because he says Dee dee dee too often, and they haven't yet realized what is part of his act, and they don't want it that way, but he still carries it that way and manages to get it people laugh. For all the haters out there, here's a message, Carlos is here to stay, it doesn't make sense to try to drop it.
