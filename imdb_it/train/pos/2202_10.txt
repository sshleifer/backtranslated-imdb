I was only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe on Sun. nights. Repeating gags, Rob opened his locker (he had to use a meter or pointer to hit the right spot on another locker and do some other things, finally kick the point where his door opened) and take pins from a new shirt (at the beginning of an episode he opened a package with a new evening shirt and for the rest of the show he found one pin after another that he missed when he dropped his shirt, the timing was everything and the pins had lots of laughs. ) I remember an aunt who drove a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. She thought and created a "semi permeable membrane" or osmosis that made her say how brilliant she was. (You must have been there). Marion Lorne stole the show whenever it was on the screen. Because they didn't continue the series from his POV when Wally stopped (he was afraid he was typed but it was too late) I will never know. I saw somewhere that the first marriage on TV (the biggest one anyway) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (I never had his place for her) and I remember it became the TV Guide cover and I got the press in all the major newspapers and magazines. A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in New York years before was disappointing that they had very few episodes back then and those could have gone now. I still remember it as wonderful and I would like to be a little older.
