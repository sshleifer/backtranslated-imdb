Fascinating in every respect, this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good. If you love jazz music, it's a must see. If you like to see adorable characters that make you smile, you can bring a tear to the eyes and swing as if there were no tomorrow this movie is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep and heavy work of art to be skimmed and analyzed, maybe you better stick with something from Darren Aronofsky (in other words - the DJ reviewer lights up, you don't know a good moment when you see it one?!) My only complaint is that the movie was really too short. I guess I'll have to watch it several times to fill up.
