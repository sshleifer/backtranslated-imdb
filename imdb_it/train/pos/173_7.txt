Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This is kind of Mr. Smith going to the kind of Washington movie, with some variations but the same premise. Years ago I recorded this film via cable, because I had a crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is highly unlikely that any cocktail waitress will have an important job in the government just because he saved the life of a big blow. It made me laugh and made me angry at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations he was in were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER FORWARD). It made me crazy to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the way it was established. And the speech he made in the end ... nice. Too bad that not many people have courage like that in real life.
