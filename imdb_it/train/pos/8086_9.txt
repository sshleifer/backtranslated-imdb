Recently I rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after seeing the live version of the movie FANTASTIC 2001. The live action trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, directed by Peter Jackson, will undoubtedly be far better than the George Lucas "Star Wars" prequel trilogy (Episodes 1-3) that will never be the true series of 21st century fantasy movies! > <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and at that moment I didn't really understand the depth of the film. Now that I've read the books, I understand what the whole plot is. Sure, some characters are pretty stupid, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)) But I have to say that he follows the book quite closely, and goes into a part of the book two, the two towers. The good things are that the action is quite interesting and some of the animations are quite remarkable for its time. The bad things are that it ends abruptly in the middle of Le Due Torri without any result of Frodo's research to destroy the only ring, and the animation seems rather dated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not as bad as many say. BUT, the live action version of 2001 is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn allowed him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever made, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I'll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings on the live version of Harry Potter every day! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale from 1 to 10, much less violent than the live action version of 2001, but NOW, as good as it is! For diehard fans of books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
