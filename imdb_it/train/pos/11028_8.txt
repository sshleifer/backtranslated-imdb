To be honest, I didn't really like this movie when I first saw it. But I guess the problem is that I didn't see it in a theater. Big mistake! Because the number 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is photography. Try watching this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system. The music is good and puts the film at a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best films. This guy knows the action. Die Hard 2, The Long Kiss Goodbye, etc. And it's particularly good in this film. The special effect is fantastic and spectacular. Stallone really needed that film to come back with success. However it's nice to see it!
