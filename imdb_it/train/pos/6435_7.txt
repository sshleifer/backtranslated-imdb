I think most people who have posted comments on this film don't understand how to watch a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. First of all, to evaluate a film it is necessary to understand to what extent everything in the film works together. Modern sensibilities require great drama. No, I do not mean large environments of characters and plots, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are very tragic or very funny. This is a thin film. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this film. It's a beautifully filmed film that combines sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality ... you call it. The world in which it is set would be foreign and not understood today ... a world in which, if you have it, you have to flaunt it NOW and LOUDLY, even if you think you have it. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian as people understand that term today. <br /> <br /> This film helps make things clear.
