Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly skilled in this type of role, where he must represent a character whose morality is, at first, uncertain for the public. As often happens in the case of Sutherland's characters, we must ask "is he a peasant [in this case, a minor], or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, intelligently told, about the incompetence and the dreadful bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that has prevented the efforts of extremely competent people. As the character of Sutherland ironically notes, "The measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions". The "committee meeting" (between the characters of Rea and Sutherland) after perestroika was applied, with its revelations, has an enormous emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of dedicated people who have worked in that system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes depicting the families of the victims adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story. This is rarely a feature of a film with this disgusting topic, but it effectively reminds us that the victims had lives, and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important film, which deserved its showcase on television of Canadian history.
