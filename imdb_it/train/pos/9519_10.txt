Tom Hanks has been in blockbusters like Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good guys for whom we support. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivan is a little different. <br /> <br /> In the Sam Mendes Road to Perdition film based on the novel by Max Allan Collins, shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this little journey is that Sullivan is a hit man who is now being hunted by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After a job done the wrong way due to Connor, the only witness to his mistake is Sullivan and his son who was not supposed to be there. So Connor tries to eliminate Sullivan and his family, but only gets his wife and his other son Peter. Sullivan beats the blow and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and son dead, Sullivan sets off to find the answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two while Sullivan tries to fix things in memory of his wife and child, and of Michael who feels like he is to blame for all this. He feels his curiosity kill his mother and his brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. brings maturity and also the feeling of being still young. His loss of innocence is well acted while traveling from city to city, leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> Mendes' previous film was American Beauty, which received five Oscars including Best Film and Best Director. This film did not go so well at the Oscars winning only one award for best photography, but receiving five more nominations for music, sound and a best actor in a supporting role for Paul Newman. This photo is a great story that takes you on a journey through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, successful man and devoted father. This film is a sleeping film that should be seen for years to come.
