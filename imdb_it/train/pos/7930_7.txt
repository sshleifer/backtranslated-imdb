I'll be honest. I took this movie to make fun of myself. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction could I have? The fact is, however, that the film (and its creators) decided it wouldn't be fooled. Instead, he would do his best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? He arrived terribly close. A little less cheese in incidental music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, ancillary expenses (like props - I love the Best Buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic of the movie genre of zombies, but it is still a small film pretty nice on its own. And acting, writing and rhythm are surprisingly better than I expected. There is also some decent humor, as two of our leaders discuss how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves your fingerprints in everything, alas) and the almost vulgar, this can be a fun time at the cinema. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the producers, the actors, the crew have all tried to make a good movie (instead of a classic of the field) and that matters a lot. The campy zombie movie line is a mile long, and thanks, guys, for not adding you. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the Quiroz brothers. I'd like to see what they do next. Hey, someone, give them a budget!
