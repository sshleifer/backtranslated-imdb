9 / 10-30 minutes of pure festive terror. Ok, so it's not that scary. But it's definitely fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) tells a story of FEAR vacation, giving us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That's it. Bwahahahahha. You should really be careful about what you have for AX Santa. Have a scary Christmas and a happy new fear. Okay, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Okay, so in history, an avid wife (the best screamer in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the trainer who receives the towel whipped to death in ANOES 2) for money. BUT, his plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a Santa costume (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) comes his way. <br /> <br /> If you search on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but many of you have already seen this (my third vision). But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do it.
