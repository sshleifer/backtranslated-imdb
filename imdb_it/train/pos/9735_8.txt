Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people". The underlying love story in the plot is, for the most part, supplanted by a much more interesting story "from rags to rich". Although the central line of the story is somewhat outdated, in different screens, it has a sense of; get the "nitty gritty" out of the way, focusing on those key relationships that make "office politics" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used solely for comic effect. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately very clever, it is playing well in the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his co-stars and fuses the intersection of high and low society fairly well and quite refreshing in a plot that, despite predictability, it is somewhat unique journey. The different characters in the film are well presented and the casting is certainly a point in favor of the film. Both the "trade" relationship between Pegg and Huston and the "love, hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst work so well in a story that is, for lack of a better word, fascinating. Even Fox, whose main advantage is of course sex appeal, shock with what turns out to be a rather obscure character and makes the role of "baby" all go well. It is one of these films where every little detail pays tribute to a great job. From transsexual strippers to an incredible soundtrack, everything fits perfectly with what can only be described as an intelligent comedy.
