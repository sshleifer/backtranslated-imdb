Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a Western A class, except one: the story, which really belongs to a B or C class. It was acceptable at the time the film was made, when people were so excited about see a western colored film, but nowadays it seems very primitive. Nevertheless, for people who love old westerns, it's fun, the original color and sound are very well preserved on the recently released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good companion, Lon Chaney is as bad as ever, and Randolph Scott is a little more cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque you would expect to see something that reminds you of the city, but the city shown here could be anywhere.
