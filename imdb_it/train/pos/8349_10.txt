Depardieu's most famous film is this (1974) founder of Bertrand Blier. It features many highly sexual scenes that come close to the X mark, including one by Jeanne Moreau who makes a hot version of her Jules and Jim from the 1970s and mentions a trois with two furry French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). In this film there is no sacred territory; everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that Americans tend not to like this movie very much, while many Frenchmen I met consider it a classic. Something goes against what Americans have been programmed to 'please'. <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two whiners, hippy noises with many sexual insecurities, who go around harassing women and committing minor crimes. I'm kicking out and anti-capitalist, euro-commissioner, "freedom". Blier satirizes the hell of these two boys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself in the end much more ridiculous. The best thing, however, is the way in which Stephane Grappelli's wonderful score conveys the restless soul of the vagabonds, the deepest subconscious or "highest ideal" awareness that motivates all the follies they engage in.
