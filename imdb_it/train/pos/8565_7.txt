If you like animal films, this film will like it. My wife likes animals and animal films, she particularly likes the parrot in this film. It is geared towards children, but I mostly laughed at humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and adds balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its applause, happy, familiar, but I like to leave the theater with a success.
