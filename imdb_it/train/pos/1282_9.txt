I saw it a couple of times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and I received a good film shock in the system. A semi-surreal approach but with a marked aptitude for modern media culture (or lack thereof), focused on some seriously upset inhabitants, beyond Hollywood. He had an entertaining first performance by Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable photographs of the DP who made the films of the Polish brothers. There was a wild humcom humor and a strangely original feeling that definitely set it apart. This movie contained a cult classic, and I'm surprised it's not yet released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
