This film speaks a universal language; one can connect it to the self, community, society or the rest of the world. It has a way not only to open several questions but also to set one to try to find out and ask the right questions to get to that point of self-belief / ownership. The portrait of stereotypes within the film deals with the archetypes that surround us and that must be recognized as the repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposite force of innovation, creativity and growth. The factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be made clear and addressed. The idea is certainly a film to be experimented and not only seen how it draws its own internal voice / consciousness through looking, it makes us feel rather than look.
