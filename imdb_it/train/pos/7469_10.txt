This film was absolutely brilliant. It actually made me think. During the whole movie I was confused to death. I liked everything ... he was just so confused and so twisted and strange, it was hard not to love him. All the actors were phenomenal and nobody could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... deserves an ocar.
