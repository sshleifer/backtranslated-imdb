I liked the silent noir of the first part, the recitation of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The moodiness of the environment and the juxtaposition of the old police and the idealistic youth were being carried out. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; she was a serious and attractive character. The film went crazy for me when the assistant mayor started snooping around the mob to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want to intrude on. No one in their right mind would have met a mobster on a pier abandoned in a landfill. Here the story has become implausible. Something I don't understand: why did the policeman and Vito have made a shooting if the latter had provided information that could have brought down the corrupt judge?
