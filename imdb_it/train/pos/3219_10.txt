This is a great movie. He has a captivating story, a fantastic main character, great acting and killer action. This happens mainly in the year 2036 but shows scenes set in the past years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all other soldiers have never had a normal life. Eventually the army introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result they don't need old soldiers like Todd. They test new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is wounded and he is assumed to be dead. The army unloads its body and others less assuming that they are all dead but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a field full of civilizations on this planet that the military has discharged. He lives there for a while but cannot adapt to normal life. He rarely says a word and is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. When they feel they are a danger to them, they send him to the desert. Just as Russell is leaving the planet he is attacked by new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train soldiers to be as smart as Todd and the other old soldiers. Thus, while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily overcomes them. The military begins to realize this and Todd kills all but one of their men. That's Jason Scott Lee and eventually you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell is obviously in first place. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a movie, including some big lines. The writer also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, because he also called women "sir". There are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and is very funny. <br /> <br /> A fantastic military action movie for Rambo, Commando and Missing in Action fans. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and fans of action / science fiction.
