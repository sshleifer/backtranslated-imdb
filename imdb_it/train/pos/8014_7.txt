But if you like the muppets I challenge you not to like this. Basically the same regurgitated plot (this time in New York, not in Los Angeles) features many funny cameos and muppet hi-jinx. Many muppets leave the film early enough because it focuses on Kermy and Miss Piggy. I happened to have a lot of fun. Fun to watch with your kids.
