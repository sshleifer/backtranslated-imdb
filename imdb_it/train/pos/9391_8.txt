Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's disturbing and violent character, and JT Walsh's cunning. <br /> <br /> A tramp is mistaken for a hitman and tries to do a little I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this film, when Cage gets into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling jobs with the help of his friend ... and the opening scene at Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... arrogant, a wicked, boiling, and explosive breakthrough. JT Walsh (RIP) is also as big as the man with a dark past, who tries to live legitimately (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real note characters here, with the exception of the tough - deputy officer in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first shot comes early, and from there it's a beautiful neo-noir adventure in a small sleeping city. Satisfactory. 8 points
