The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film rather than just entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and discover and remember the torture he was subjected to to kill his old identity: he really killed someone who became his corpse. But the film is finally revealing that all this has been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film with the aim of eliminating all American citizens who have tried to prevent control of the entire company by a limited group of people. Who was an essential CIA officer until 1980, when he became vice president? This goes hand in hand with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to bring this truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision about the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; read my lips. In the United States politics is fought by the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and cinema. Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, the academic world and the intellectuals use cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go see the movie. It's pretty funny and has the sweet smell of the end of a period and the great change that some expect and others are waiting for, but nobody is able to pretend that it won't come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
