The invisible man is a show that everyone must love! It reminds me of the old school 80s series (a-team, airwolf, knightrider) The special effects are small but very effective !! but the most important thing is the fun with which they shot this series. Really show! the whole cast fits the roles perfectly and it looks like they can do whatever they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this! for me it is incredible that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style. He doesn't get a movie in a great movie (Mr. Tarantino this was the show you should have directed! this shows if you can. it's worth it !!!
