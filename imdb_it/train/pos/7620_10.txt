Lost is the best television series there is. First of all, it has great actors and wonderful direction. Writing is a very controversial topic because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after the third season writing became very complex. For example, who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What is fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? A lot of people think that the writers are lost and they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't explain. I believe these people are wrong. I trust writers. I think if the mysteries are revealed by now all the charm of the series will be gone. In any case, the loss is undeniably the biggest TV series and will continue to be for a long time.
