I really enjoyed the movie, however, I didn't realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life. First of all, I wasn't aware of Lucille. There is very little (almost no) mention of women who are intimately linked to Little Richard. Even in his life today no mention is made of any involvement of females in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, the film was fantastic. Leon also did not like to play Little Richard, he is a good actor but I feel that the part of him should have gone to a different actor. Visually, it didn't remind me of Little Richard. I was also totally unaware of the promiscuity of which Little Richard was a part. From the film he was portrayed as a sexual addict. In today's time he would have referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I don't want to ruin the film from someone who hasn't seen the movie, but there were a lot of things about the film that I think shouldn't be part of the final cut.
