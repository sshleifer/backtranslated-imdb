This group of English professionals is a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of them. It is seen before love spreads between the head of the intervention, his wife and a new resident in surgery. Only the acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and the sexy Robson Greene raise this category from the trash to a very pleasant romp. The only quibble is that it is difficult to accept that the steaming Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me is not an international sex symbol, or even a British one. You can readily understand why Robson Green would light his fire, apologizing to the "Doors". The boy who almost steals the show with a great "relaxed" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. See it in "The Way We Live Now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​its range. Daniela Nardini, Kitchen's secretary, sometimes a sex toy, is hard to forget as the rejected lover makes Kitchen feel sorry for ever having looked at his big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's shoulder surgery companions, as I said, could have their own series. They are so good. The whole thing is very funny, and I highly recommend it, and thanks to imdbman for allowing paying customers to have their say in this fascinating place.
