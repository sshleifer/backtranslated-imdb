This is not a movie for fans of the usual haunting Lynch stuff. Rather, it's for those who either appreciate a good story, or got tired of the bombastic stuff with overt sentimentality and Oprah-ish "This is a wonderful movie! You have to see it!" - semantics (even if you're right, for once!). <br /> <br /> The story unfolds impeccably and we are taken on a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at a given moment. A compassionate and existentialist journey in which we apologize for our past when we approach our inevitable demise. <br /> <br /> Acting without defects, even cinematography (sometimes quite brilliant!), And the dialogue goes far enough for the viewer to grasp the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A hot movie. Not overly sentimental.
