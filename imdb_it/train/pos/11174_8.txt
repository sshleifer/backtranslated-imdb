Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King. Not surprisingly, since King himself wrote the script. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine home. One of the other residents is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows some things about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their yard. The other is a path that leads to the Pet Sematary, where children have buried animals killed by the highway for decades. Soon, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, except for Louis (the father), is out for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another cemetery, beyond the Pet Sematary, where the Church must be buried. Later, Louis is greeted (not so politely) by the Church. He came back, seeming to have chewed his way out of the bag in which he had been buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the adaptations of the King I saw would have been the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. The suspense is kept quite high during the film, partly due to the development of the plot. The scene in which Gage is killed will remain forever in your mind. So obviously we have the conclusion. It is easy to determine what will happen, but Lambert attracts some really disturbing and sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie and an excellent adaptation. If you like being scared and don't mind being obsessed with some occasionally disturbing images, then "Pet Sematary" is just what you're looking for. Non-horror fans will want to avoid this.
