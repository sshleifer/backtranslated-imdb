Liam Neeson plays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a real actor. It fascinates the public with its charisma as it does in all its roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Maria is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes his love immortal. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; one way or another, by watching the film, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The scenery of Scotland is beautiful. The environment and the conditions of the times are represented quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. An important point that makes this film so beautiful is that no actor or actress is fascinated; they get dirty and in fact appear uninteresting in various scenes. Their skills are like actors that attract you, they don't rely on brand names, popularity or sex appeal. This is something special.
