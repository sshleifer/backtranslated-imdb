"Kalifornia" is a great film that makes us look at ourselves. The film has an exceptional cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through It and The Legends Of The Fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide: Life On The Street and Escape From LA) as Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and What's Eating Gilbert Grape) as Early's Adele Corners. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a liberal writer, he is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie decide to move to California, so Brian puts an announcement in college for some who want to go to California to share the expenses during the trip. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is a former prisoner and probationary sociopath, who recently lost his job as the mirror factory in the city, is in debt, owes his landlord's money. Elyly's word officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job. lege and sees the ad, then tells Adele, his girlfriend to leave to go to California. Elyly and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave the city. Brian and Carrie don't know that he's a killer who just killed his landlord. For a while Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele differently, but they met them and became kind of friends, Carrie and Adele became real good friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey is very instructive. Although Brain and Carrie don't know soon he is a murderer until later in the movie. The question that Brian asks in this film about the difference between murderers and us is a very good question. Elyly Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the error of his ways, goes down the hill later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it to 10/10 stars and 2 inches up. I love the songs in the film, especially at the end of the film, the Indian song "Look Up To The Sky".
