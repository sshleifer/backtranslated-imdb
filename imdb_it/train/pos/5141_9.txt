I have to admit that I didn't expect much to see this film in my Japanese film class, but this movie really upset me. The director does a great job following the title of his film, actually depicting an image of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the similarity of madness, helping the viewer to experience the inner world of the characters rather than the world out of his mind. This film has just added to my feelings about foreign silent films against Americans, as foreign films work a lot more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than go for the soft film always with happy ending, exercising the imagination a lot little.
