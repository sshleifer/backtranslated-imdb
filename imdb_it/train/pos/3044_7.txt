For all those who do not know what a film was from an actor, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really doesn't make sense. It is full of trivial situations, trite lines, melodrama, comedy ... you call it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can make everything convincing, and this film is no exception. Each one turns into a decent performance: Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But it is the Megastar that obscures everyone with its imposing presence. Without him, this film would have been an appetizer ... The story speaks of separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good against evil - everything, really! Amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all fronts, in an otherwise stupid movie! And did I say it's ridiculously funny?
