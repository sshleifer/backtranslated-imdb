I was young to always know a lot about the prince, but in the last few years I have seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty t-shirts and I thought they were fantastic but I didn't want to buy a shirt that I knew nothing about. So one Saturday he turned on and I decided to watch it. I didn't know what the movie would talk about before watching it but it was great once I found out. In the film the prince was not known as a prince but as "the child". All the performances were great, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I was dying for you. All the songs related to what was happening during the film when her mother and her father always quarreled about the song when the doves screamed describing what she felt. I also like how smart the prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I loved it when Prince and Appallonia met for the first time in the club and he stood behind his position and then, once he turned around, he disappeared! great movie and now I can't even find one of those t-shirts :(
