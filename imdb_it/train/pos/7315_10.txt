Very influential classic low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> Apparently unstoppable killer escapes from the psychiatric institution and returns to his hometown where he starts chasing a local babysitter on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a film that never ceases to live up to its fame as a masterpiece of horror! Carpenter's terrifying story and his intelligent direction give this film such a chilling life that it must be seen to be really heard! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors that even make the daily setting of a neighborhood of a small town disturbing. Carpenter well times his suspense and his tremors to make them the most effectively surprising, which in itself is a prodigy that few horror filmmakers ever manage to manage! Furthermore, he is wise enough to give us really nice young characters and a very scary bad guy to keep the tension even stronger. The highest compliments also go to Carpenter's soundtrack, simple but frighteningly disturbing. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. The young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a nice breakthrough like the adorable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's so good that she would have been in a series of other horror films before she got into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants performs perfectly like Myer's doctor, who is desperate to catch him again. The support cast Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are also good. <br /> <br /> Like his own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to quiver and relax. It's a MUST for all fans of the genre! <br /> <br /> **** ****
