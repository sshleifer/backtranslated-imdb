Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi perform in "Anchors Aweigh", directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two sailors on leave in Hollywood. They meet a boy (Dean Stockwell) and, when they take him home, meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. He wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They try to help, but there is some confusion. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with great dances and songs by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly dances with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and my heart sings. It's not one of my favorite voices, but she's good for it. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows his versatility and the reason why the girls faint on him, with those big blue eyes and a boy's face. For Kelly, this was a big chance for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie, very lively.
