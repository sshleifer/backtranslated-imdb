Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early 1990s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "Die Hard in a / on a". Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a mountain", and quite good, for what it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, who are good clones of Die Hard on their terms, Cliffhanger dispenses with the closed feeling of many action films and embraces breathtaking landscapes that, in their immensity , threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of people who fight and die among the peaks. <br /> <br /> Years before other films like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder in snowy places, Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of the juxtaposition of brutal violence and bitter struggles to survive in a cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has already received substantial praise, all it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is really happening. Not even Harlin's blow to the falling bird that is powerful but still threatening to become too joke (and repeated in Deep Blue Sea), or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face, can tarnish the power of sequence. <br /> <br /> The next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and theft on board the jet. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the audience is immersed in the action not knowing initially which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert noted, the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists / thieves actually seems to fall as the snow wall takes him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this film (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. But the shot itself remains impressive because we are wondering why Harlin (or more likely one of the directors of the second unit) knew exactly where to place the camera. I will take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he is one of the few movie stars I have ever seen that is completely convincing as someone who can endure a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time really feel that pain. The role of Gabe Walker really complements the strengths of Stallone: ​​he plays a kind of older and more vulnerable action hero, giving an incredibly low-key performance like a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself. <br /> <br /> Unlike many of the post-Matrix comic-inspired action heroes of today, Stallone's Walker is a normal man who becomes a hero with no paranormal or computer-powered skills. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes and his clothes begin to show great tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. He grimaces when he is hit and bleeds when he is cut, especially in the cave sequence when he punches Rocky by one of the rascal dogs. <br /> <br /> Note that the villains are despicable I really contribute to the effectiveness of the film: when I saw this film for the first time as a teenager, I was rooting for the good guys at every step and anticipated when another bad would have bitten the dust (or rather, the ice); at one point I even cheered because one of the most cold-blooded characters in the film suffered a violent disappearance. <br /> <br /> The Lithgow British accent is not as convincing as the occasional model airplane or helicopter model of the film, but it is fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who manages to play the silly dialogue perfectly. : in a scene, looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says "You, stay! You, take!" Even a better actor, like Anthony Hopkins, may have had problems with that line . <br /> <br /> Although Cliffhanger from time to time puts credibility aside, he does it only for a more entertaining show. <Br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, for example, Lithgow openly tells one of his men "Retire [Stallone] when he goes down". No real criminal mind would have made this mistake unconsciously: his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning to Sly on the rock wall, and this precipitates a compelling tug of war between Stallone and the villains who try to pull him down from the rope tied to the his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have given its order with a more subtle medium, but the sequence may not have been so fun to watch if it had not given Rooker the opportunity to openly challenge the arrogance of his kidnapper. <br /> <br /> Much made in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or (sometimes) in a western, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that have undermined a minor film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned earlier, the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY false snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem useless in a narrative already full of action. Finally, Harlin's decision to film some of the slow-motion scenes of death seems pointless, as the technique does not contribute to the scenes. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Stallone is too old for action movies, because his character in this film seems so believable that I inevitably wonder how it will be after years. But maybe it's better that Cliffhanger is alone forever, without a sequel: there are already enough sets of tired and obsolete films. There was an unofficial sequel called Vertical Limit: compared to that clinker, Cliffhanger belongs to the Top 250 list of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of Stallone's other films.)
