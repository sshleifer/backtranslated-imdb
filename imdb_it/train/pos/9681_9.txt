Add Paulie the parrot to the beloved animal characters in the film. This film is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find the rightful owner many years after Marie's parents sold it to a pawnshop. Before the end of heart warming we learn all of Paulie's misadventures. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photography throughout Great little film, word of mouth will make it a favorite cult.
