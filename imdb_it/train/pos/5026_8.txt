This is a great movie that everyone should see. Sounds like a book by Dean Koontz. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was great because he really seems to believe in what he is saying and doing. <br /> <br /> I don't know because viewers must read in a sort of defense for religious murder in the film. It's fiction. The ending is surprising, but imaginary. So? I think that's what makes this movie so beautiful. SPOILER DOES NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM. Throughout the film, the viewer is continually shocked by the illness of Paxton's character, the impact on children and the way children handle this outrageous conduct. And then in the end, it turns out to be true. God put him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. Of course, he was given information that he couldn't have known otherwise, but the film goes further to show how God is "protecting" Adam through the convenient problem of video quality and the complete lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film is not supporting Christian murder, it is simply bringing the viewer into a very unexpected race.
