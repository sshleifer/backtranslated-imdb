Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, is a fun field horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the lines often remain below the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become a character of their own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a stewardess of the stacked horror show, who learns, who inherited her aunt Morgana. So she goes to a small town of Fallwell, which is governed by the most hideous monster that ever embraced the earth: moral comedy. The boobacious aspect of Elviras is, of course, too much for dried prunes, but the children of the city have a great time in its different approach to life. And, of course, there is also the most sinister evil, his uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is looking for Elvira's book of magic. See, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just doesn't know. But yet. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is a rather amusing film, although the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most of the laughter comes from the difference between Elvira and people with good morale, but there are also a couple of good visual gags. Everywhere the direction is fine, but nothing ever arises again. In all, a good comedy intentionally campy. If you like this kind of thing, this is it.
