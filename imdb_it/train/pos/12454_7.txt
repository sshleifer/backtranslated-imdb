magellan33 said: "You can do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one member of the cast." I suppose, therefore, that you have never heard of "Topper". <br /> <br /> Which, in addition to the two stars that could only be seen by a cast member, had a dog, ditto. <br /> <br /> This was the kind of program that had "Not Gonna Make It" was written starting from the first episode - it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play; nobody (well, very few of us, apparently) wants to see a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires * the thought * to seize.
