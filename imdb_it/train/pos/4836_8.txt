I saw the film a few days ago on a videotape and even though it was difficult to swallow it in a single shot (due to its length and history), I liked it a lot. I was struck first by the script and then by the realization of this script. The film takes you around, but it's not an easy, joyful race; it passes through time and different political regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the inner logic that the film followed; logic, which just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and turns had a meaning. However, it makes no sense to try to re-tell the story as it spreads over more than 50 years. I also loved the character of Nikita Mikhalkov Aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics would have seen, with a restless abandon. What I didn't like, is that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij Romans, which I really love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and the Injured" ( "Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows, I believe, that great film producer Andrei Konchalovski was before going to Hollywood and making forgotten films like "Tango and Cash" and less forgettable as "Runaway train". I would prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
