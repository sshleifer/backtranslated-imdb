A very funny film that presents characters that do bad things and that let emotions burst like anger and the desire for revenge. The cast is very good, there's a lot of action, and eventually Stewart gets the girl and her revenge (with a twist). I've seen this movie several times and I always watch when it's on AMC or cable. Highly recommended...
