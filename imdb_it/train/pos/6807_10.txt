I have copies of both of these films, the classic in which Robert Blake is a very good actor in which most of the 1967 film Blake is most represented next to a prison window that tells of his childhood life, since he killed the The Clutter family shows a lot in the classic of what really happened and doesn't tell us which one really did the murder, but it's really a great show if you watch the 1996 movie In cold Blood the classic makes a lot more sence.
