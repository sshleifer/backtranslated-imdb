I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for films with African Americans. It seemed what it is; a very tendentious "tendentious" comedy in which a tense black man understands that his son is gay. It would appear that Redd Foxx's (RF) wife left him for his brother, who works with him at the Phoenix "store". He took the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Just as RF arrives, Norman, wearing only powder blue bikini shorts, comes out of his waterbed to answer the door. Trying to gain time by getting his old father up the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who firmly refuses to move. It was only to the point where I wrote "WHY don't you wake up?" when he suddenly does, and my friend's and my mouth's jaws fall for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of Garson with blue eyes and turbulent hair, Norman's white lover, who "He had the greatest faaaaabulous dream ??" Garson is a flamboyant queen of a type who can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 in Los Angeles. She has dresses, a bag and big puffy jewels, and seems to have shaped both her appearance and her personality on Carol Brady of The Brady Bunch. > <br /> Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else during his father's visit. Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madama answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> So RF tries to reach his wife in Mexico. While on the phone, Garson comes in to pack and RF confronts him. With an explosion of 70's soul music destined to evoke his nascent revelation (but it seems more like we're about to listen to a very special song from The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> the first impulse is "I will kill him, I will kill him". Then the RF takes a long walk, reviewing all the thoughts that a confused parent might have, like "maybe we trained him too soon." His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees in his path, for example a tiring truck driver who appears while contemplating what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookshop and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, it must be said, is about another eight books on homosexuality than those bought by my parents. Then he goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> RF then hires Audrey, a six foot Amazon prostitute (in this incredible fur coat) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. She hired her for Norman to try heterosexuality, but this angers Norman and rushes off to go stay with her friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson approaches and offers to take RF out for the night. He commits himself for the loss of RF's wife and tells the story of his mother, who has an irrational prejudice against the Filipino because "she was harassed in a luau". They attend a long performance by Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam who violently beats her head against the piano until her hair comes off. Once again, the mouths were wide open. <br /> <br /> So it seems that, you didn't know, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see, serious, the old traditional black men just have to watch the gaudy and highly effeminate fun of the mega-queens to come around ALL the gay world has to offer! It is really ONLY this simple! This still does not prevent RF from screaming "Rape!" when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends up in a less predictable way than you think. <br /> <br /> There was so much that he had just left. What is the basis of the relationship between Norman and Garson? They don't seem to have ANY relationship, and Norman has no qualms about throwing Garson out, and even when he comes to defend himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There were some gently characteristic touches like the RF that bought all those homosexuality books - and they sat right on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent can actually try to find out something about homosexuality, rather than run away to get drunk or feel sorry for his friends. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, it is a bit like it looks like: a small relic of a bygone era, a time when some homosexuals thought that if heterosexual people sat and watched an exhibition of puppet, we could all learn to love and understand each other! And because of the whole ingenuity of this thing, extreme stereotypes and message-filled dialogue have just turned out to be extraordinarily obsolete, and provide a great deal of argument to discuss how things have changed for gays over the past 30 years . I imagine the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay gay friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk to sleep, and by extension convert them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, take a look at Cinema de Merde, my website about bad and bad movies (with some good movies launched).
