The first episode of this infamous horror series features a woman kidnapped by a band of men dressed in black who torture her for several days before killing her. He is beaten wildly, turned in his chair relentlessly, he has his fingernails drawn, the guts of animals are thrown on him, the hot boiling water is poured on her and at the end his eyeball is pierced with a needle (really sick scene it is bad). The producers of this unforgettable torture show have tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff movie that can be achieved without committing a murder on tape. Of course some special effects are pretty bad, but the idea of ​​making a snuff is pretty macabre. I also saw "Flowers of Flesh and Blood" which is more bloody and sadistic, but less disturbing. Anyway, this is a must for horror fans!
