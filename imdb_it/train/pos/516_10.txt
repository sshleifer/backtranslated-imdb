One of the few best films of all time. The transition from black and white to color for the Heaven and Earth sequences was excellent for directing. <br /> <br /> The Plot is extremely intelligent, the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all human emotions and despite being a war movie it does not discriminate. I must have seen this movie more than any other, and I never get tired. It is a film that challenges your own mortality and your beliefs about what happens after our disappearance.
