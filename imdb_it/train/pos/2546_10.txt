This is only in the same league as "The Black Cat", although I would give a 9 rather than a 9+. This is really a praise for a film that has been underestimated so much that it's great! <br /> <br /> "The Invisible Ray" is partly horror, partly dramatic and certainly partly sci-fi. For a film made in 1936 the elements of science fiction were much ahead of their time. The mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect blend, while the acting by Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many elements of James Whale done so often What I'm saying is that this film is disturbing and well filmed. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of mood. It's a highlight in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre. <br /> <br /> As in "The Black Cat" and "Island of Lost Souls", I can't understand why this movie has yet to be released on DVD. When you consider part of the trash that has already been transferred to DVD, it's much weirder. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you have the chance. When released on DVD, grab it quickly and place it in a place of honor inside your DVD library.
