Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I expected this film to be a complete disappointment - but when I saw it I couldn't stop laughing! It has officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know what hate is here, maybe it's because a film of this type never existed before. I can't name another completely female comedy. A lot of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be many supportive male characters. This was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett's brief appearance - and it worked. All the actresses have made very funny performances (in particular Missi Pyle) from an eccentric and adorable script. <br /> <br /> The fascination of this film, for me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and the breaking of gender roles. Though carefree, each of the protagonists is faced with a challenge while their attempts to be more "amusing" are in conflict with their feminist values ​​and with whom they met. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a film for its cast of women only and the lack of a great actor to bring the studios behind, and I have to agree. Everyone who I recommended this movie loved it and I think it's a shame that a comedy that celebrates female laziness has not been widely accepted and successful. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has mind or love for the woman-centered comedy.
