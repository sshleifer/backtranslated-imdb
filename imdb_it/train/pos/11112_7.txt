Grab a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and a lot of lowbrow comedy, and you've got THE SOPRANOS, about a mob clan that operates in northern New Jersey. It's almost as fun as professional wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire the very complicated Tony Soprano by James Gandolfini, a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience. I also came to admire the contributions of people like Dom Chianese with gravel like the baffled but murderous uncle, Tony Sirico with silver hair like Paulie perpetually perplexed and the beautiful Edie Falco as the double, hard and nail Carmela Soprano. Violence is sudden and graphic, body counting rises steadily in every season, but often it's the small moments that matter most here. Watch Paulie and Tony Christopher's nephew (Michael Imperioli late for LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in Pine Barrens and sit down on a cold and bitter night in an abandoned trruck, both convinced they had it.
