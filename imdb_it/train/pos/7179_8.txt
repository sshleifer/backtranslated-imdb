brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the girls remembered full of terror from stories like IT - as the exact opposite. There is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends of 20 years in a row - remember or seem to suffer. On the line everything is described as friendly jostling, perhaps periodically described as "taking" one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * angst * embedded in the film and the participants in the next life describe the relationships - all we see are the young people who have grown to be basically the same people. More mature, but still fundamentally the same people and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Completely fantastic! Not only because people can grow relatively unscathed from social conventions - but also that friendships can actually last. In this sense, this film is a small Perla - as it is assumed that this was the intent of the film: a portrait of unforced emotions that bind people. That, when viewed in opposition to the films of recent years that portray the dark sides of childhood, the violent inhibitions of Bowling for Combine are what comes easily to mind, but since the mid-80s along with the growing adoration of children and of childhood (accompanied by 1000s of commercials, animations and series directed at children) various films and documentaries have been successful in portraying the dark sides of growth - abuse, loneliness, the drive for excellence - which are translated in adults with dark and twisted minds. /> <br /> And here comes a movie, which says: It is possible to have a happy childhood, take a look! <br /> <br /> Thanks for this. Or the illusion of the counterweight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
