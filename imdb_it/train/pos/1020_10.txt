"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team called SG-1 through a device called Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> After seeing this series sporadically for the first seasons in which it came out, I didn't know how good this series would have been, 10 years after seeing an episode for the last time. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is much more than just a science fiction series, it is one of the most well-made, interesting, long-lasting and exciting sci-fi ever made. And why? Because it works on an incredible premise. <br /> <br /> The value of this series far exceeds that of the film on which it was based and I think it is an excellent example of television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that does not works on the film's time limits. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, looking at the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is amazing and simply adds the possibility of suspending disbelief, and it is all the result of a terrifying writing and a lot of dedication from part of the whole crew the show. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" continued to offer great adventures for all 10 years, but he was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and left room for very different time periods of the show: <br / > <br /> - The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th / 5th, focused much more on the exploration of the planets and the different situations, keeping the episodes quite independent of one another had it not been for the ever imminent threat of Goaul. <br /> <br /> - From 5 to 7 there have been more and more episodes focusing on the fight against Goaul and the prevention of attacks on Earth. After this season, the exploration of the planets was almost just an excuse to put sg-1 in a place of conflicts Goaul'd / replicator / ori <br /> <br /> - The eighth season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor land issues in which the stargate is not even mentioned, but the latest episodes present some great moments of replication. <br /> <br /> - 9 and 10 travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil. Both are good continuations, even if the first episodes of the tenth season are a little weak, because they seem to be little more than SG-1 and humans / Jaffa who lose battle after battle against the Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically, after the seventh season, the exploration was pushed into the background, which in many ways was a sin, due to the potential and mystery that each planet (episode) presented; on the other hand, he has created so many great episodes of ongoing conflicts that the show's nature change has worked and shows how great the writers were. <br /> <br /> I also believe that the series has a high quality finish that puts it well at rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the narrative of the series had a lot to offer. A season gone back to the beginning the nature of the series was very feasible and would have been very welcome, but in the end things are as they are. <br /> <br /> In the end, due to the fact that I liked everything, it's a bit difficult to find that it ends. The general picture, however, that drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a show of beauty and a true testimony of the dedication of the crew, of those exceptional actors and of the characters we will always remember as a collective with the name of SG-1.
