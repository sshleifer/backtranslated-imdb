I came to this excellent program in about 4 seasons and since then I have seen all the episodes obtained all the episodes on DVD and it continues to improve more and more with the seasons 9 and 10. Now it may not have Richard Dean Anderson now but the addition by Ben Browder and Claudie Black, however, gave the show more strength and originality even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately now the science fiction channel has gotten rid of this incredible show without a relay of hope for a season 11, there are two films on DVD and hopefully more. Atlantis is still going strong in its fourth season. And there is a third spin-off in the works that the stargate franchise is not near death. This television program is a must for all science fiction fans and people of gender because this has a wide range of things to attract to all ages and all types of people. Look at IT !!!!! 10/10
