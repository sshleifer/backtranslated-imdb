It was a real show when this show was active because it was a fresh, innovative and original show. This makes every show I've ever seen seem boring. The moment the first episode aired I was ecstatic and I became so attached to all the characters (which usually never happens because I always hate some characters). It's a shame that this show doesn't have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen and it's not exaggerating my feelings for the show at all. Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC find to replace this show? This is easily the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
