Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles at me. Originally I had created and copied a VHS tape of this wonderful television presentation. My heart was broken when I realized what I had been doing since I had failed to get a copy anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently, I subscribed to the digital cable, and while I was looking through the upcoming movies, there was a surprise transmission to the film of mine. This time, however, I made a copy of it on DVD, so there is no possibility to repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> I finally got to see him again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a bit of a prelude to this story as my first contact with "Pandora's Clock" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I just happened to tune in to the broadcast station on my way home for lunch, and from the first episode I was conquered. Every day, I waited anxiously for the next chapter to be read. <br /> <br /> When I heard a few months after the book was broadcast on TV as a movie, I made sure to cancel my program for that event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, contrary to what another reviewer had said. This, in itself, is a rare achievement for TV movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not have imagined a better choice for Richard Dean Anderson's Captain Holland. Literally, the film may have stopped and burned without an appropriate cast for this crucial role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame we haven't seen him since. In fact, all the cast members have done a great job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film - and the book - was the interjection of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stem and pull down the plane hit. Basically, we're talking less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this, and folks, which is not at all realistic given all the players involved. Also it was unrealistic how little the plane had been hit by having the first one, then two of its engines ran down. <br /> <br /> That beef aside, I liked the building's suspense and found it very credible how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as were ours. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it by all means.
