I saw "El Mar" yesterday and I thought it was a great movie. Start with a childish episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that we jump about 10 years in a hospital where the 3 friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion, sickness, love, violence and sexuality rage during the creation of the film and the intense and tense film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the film is too bloody and I think they missed the point in the story. It is a violent, intense and sad story. People should suffer. To cry. Be hurt. To bleed. And I think that what the film shows is not made for pure shock value or presented in an unpleasant way. I know that some people like their "clean" movies, even those with violence in it. But sometimes, a film needs to make you feel uncomfortable at work. This is one of those movies. And a great movie is. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details of the plot were not 100% clear and only after having thought of them at the end of the film, everything has a sense. But it was nothing very important for the general story, so I keep giving this film a 9.
