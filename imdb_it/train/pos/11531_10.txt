I remember being a child when I saw this film for the first time, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I can still remember some parts of it). I don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things, but I remember a man having his head exploded with a grenade, a male forgetful on a tree and a male hit by a truck and shot in the head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene where Jennifer McAllister tore the killer stomach to get the truck keys. It's a film that gives you goose bumps and it's worth a look. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
