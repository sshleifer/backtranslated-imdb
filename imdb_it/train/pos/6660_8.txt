"Gandhi as husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. 'Gandhi ... my father' is a story that only a few would know about these details. Definitely an idea of ​​Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the film for the story and the film industry. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah have done a good job. Most of the scenes in the movie are beautiful desktop wallpapers ... a commendable job. Traditional Indian folk music as a background soundtrack during parts of the film gives a good feeling of the events. <br /> <br /> However, what I didn't like was the narrative style. In several places, I found the tone too dramatized. <br /> <br /> In general, excellent work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as a "must-watch-once". 8/10
