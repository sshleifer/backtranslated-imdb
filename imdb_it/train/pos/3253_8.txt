It is not a film to be taken seriously, but still a great little film. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of plush. Acting, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those films you wouldn't want to see, but that brings a smile every time you pass on the cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a visit if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
