The main objective of this film, one of the first and best international color films of the cinematographic work, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And he managed very well to do so. The audience would not sit for a love story of two exotic young lovers in ancient Egypt, if played by the typical 300 pounds over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music appropriately. Hence the visual replacement of the wonderful principals (a young Loren, the beautiful Della Marra, and a slim Mrs Maxwell) that make the story much more credible, giving those who are not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance of being courted in the adorable airs that otherwise might not be. Overall, a lovely introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing him when I was in junior high and this has certainly awakened my interest in the work, a form with which I did not know well. I continue to consider this film with affection and I highly recommend it to those who might like excellent music accompanied by better than average images. Luciano Della Marra was a protagonist of Radames, and unfortunately for the public he did not appear in any other film.
