I grew up in Houston and was nine when this film was released. As a result, I don't remember anything about the film. But I remember the feeling he caused from Gilley and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin 'for Love" that still brings back childhood memories every time I hear it. <br /> <br /> However, some years I saw this film for the first time as an adult and all I can say is that I was speechless. Few films have impressed me the most. This film is as raw and real as it can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch, from the Texas City chemical plant, from Gilley's ballroom and from Bud and Sissy. And perhaps for this reason it does not have a wider appeal. But it doesn't matter how you feel about country music (I can't stand it anyway despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. For this reason I love it!
