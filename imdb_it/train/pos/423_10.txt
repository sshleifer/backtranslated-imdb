I just read the plot summary and it's the worst I've ever read. It doesn't do justice to this incredible film. For an example of a good summary, read the list on "Turner Classic Movies". However, this was one of my favorite movies as a child. My sister and I could not wait until April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse films of its time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can see. The romance is clean and appealing. The plot is interesting and the songs are fantastic. They don't make films like this anymore. Good acting and not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great actors.
