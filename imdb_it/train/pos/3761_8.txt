Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are the sequel to Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Their false journey follows almost immediately after the first film, and it does just as well if it is better to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot is an evil person of the future who is trying to kill Bill and Ted uses evil robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with the gruesome reaper (death) and bring their lives back to normal. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is top notch, and even thought to be a bit strange at times, especially the conversations of Bill and Ted, is a great movie. The wannabe rockers have definitely made another great film. Collect this next time you're at the blockbuster!
