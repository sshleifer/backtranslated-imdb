Mahatma Gandhi, the nation's father in his quest for the struggle for freedom in India ignored his family and son, this film is about his son Hiralal who feels neglected because of Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights the cause of India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father who is a lawyer, since Gandhi was involved in the struggle for freedom, he wanted his wife and children to join a service to society and consequently Hirirala does not have a chance completes his education and fails his exams, he marries his love gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become a lawyer like his father, but his dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead delivers it to another person saying the bag study should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student who lives in the colony. This angers the hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being ignorant and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands on the streets through failed work attempts and with a huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna gave a stellar performance as Hiralal gandhi .. everything to him, the direction and the script are fantastic, the representation is excellent. overall an excellent film and a must see. I give him a 10/10
