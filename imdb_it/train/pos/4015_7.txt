One of the most satisfying western-style Italians, Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAIs made during the golden age of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or of intelligent and unconventional cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is, in many ways, not terribly original, but that doesn't really count against it. The success of a genre film depends on the way it meets the expectations of the public and provides surprising variations on these expected elements. Previously, pleasurable experiences have been recreated but with a subtle (or greater) touch that provides continuous interest. The quality of the execution is also obviously important. A tired reconstruction will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the public. <br /> <br /> With these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are numerous footage of elements from previous films. The setting is the brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world, shared by many of the best westerns of the "Gothic family" of 1964-1968 as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic plot of Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Ringo's films, a fact that is not surprising since Leo's screenwriter Fendiando was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best scriptwriters of popular cinema released by Cinecittà in the 60s and 70s and his work has contributed to providing much of thematic continuity and coherence to the genre (along with a couple of other personalities in some distinct circles of actors, directors and screenwriters). In the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in the city, arouses a tense situation, then suffers an almost death from death followed by a resurrection (in some films, like Quella dirty history in the west (1968) is literally a crucifixion). The Catholic undertone to fiction and symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist / explicit socialist inclinations of the directors and their films. The plot of Ringo, developed more completely by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, a selfish protagonist chooses the interest of a community on his own through a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy ironic touch of uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer by Fistful of Dollar (1965). The two scenes of the exchange of firearms provide an intelligent dialogue and understanding between the two. Numerous films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or El Chuncho, quién sabe? (1967), uses this relationship between an old man and a young man (father / son, elder / younger brother, counselor / opponent and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic in the plot. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is the attention on deception and misdirection, labyrinths and mirrors, which recur in the best early WAIs. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become literal labyrinths through which the protagonist and the antagonist play changing games of cat and mouse. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAIs is the quality of the use of the visual / psychological space of the director Romolo Guerriri together with the arrangement of the intelligent script mechanisms to forward the plot. Dialogue has never been very important for WAI and often absurdly unintelligible (I thought there were exceptions, such as the cynical comments of Django (1966) or Face to Face (1967). <br /> <br /> Psychological depth of the character is created almost entirely through iconic images, are the juxtapositions and the description of the overall narrative situation.See how the presence of the mortal Samantha is felt during the typing scene, looking from the roof or the background of the action. security and confidence in their power through its stealth invasions of their ranch, hotel, even bedroom (this, again, is a theme of FOD). Finally, note how we focus on information seeking, many elements, this is borrowed from FOD which was ultimately based on the hard-boa novel Red Harvest.It is through accidental contacts, wanted posters, listened to conversations, glances f uori from the windows, clocks left in the dus t, or identity and wrong movements through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative points to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film was remarkable in its time for what was perceived as excess in violence. Of course, these films were hardly more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of violence and the causes to which it was attributed, that is to say that it was not violence but the meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is distinct and interesting in the use and representation of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally find more interesting than most of this genre is the link that provides the anonymous with an unnamed public in Italy and Spain to which these recurring narratives had a certain meaning and interest. Can the artifact have no intrinsic value in and of itself? any flint withering from a prehistoric site, a fragment of crusted ceramic or a piece of leather and rusty metal ?? but refers to some nameless presence, lives, which were significant simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic value, much of his interest comes from this connection and mystery. <br /> <br /> Top western spaghetti list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Media SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Only for fanatics (lower part of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
