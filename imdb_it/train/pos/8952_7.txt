Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she is attracted to her fairly normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to unload her boyfriend and fall in love with her. Things are going pretty well until Gillian discovers she's really interested in this mortal man. He decides to tell him his secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out he was "deceived" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> With regard to the light-hearted 50s comedies, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It's a pretty fun watch and should please anyone who sits with it. Just don't get into the movie expecting the best thing since the sliced ​​bread. The film is cute, funny at times and moving at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have a real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) seems quite unbelievable in an understated way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often ridiculously loud and steals a lot of spotlights from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't decide what kind of movie they want to be. Is it a fucked comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quine had only blocked one approach, the film could have been even better and more memorable.
