A compelling, honest, bold and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches the painful experiences of rape pain - "Descent" is a film that went under the radar due to its lack of distribution because, frankly, the film is so brutal in his depictions, that if he had been theatrically distributed, he might have encountered some strong partial hatred. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be discovered not only for its obscure themes, and not only for its surprising direction and authentic style - but above all for its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely amazing, bringing enough malaise and sufficient vulnerability to create one, not to identify himself, but to understand this fractured man with a distorted perspective on his sexuality with not only violent women, but also fragile insecurities within himself. . It is a supporting performance that is so complex, courageous and emotional on the part of Faust. It's hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, the standout is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A tour-de-force of dramatic and realistic tics, and one of the most subtle but noisy performances for some time. While Dawson is seen in some good support performances in some very successful films, he proves that he has the credentials to perform in exciting and moving shows, credibly and thematically. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of his year (and 2007 was a strong film) - this film, underrated and intelligent, has been successful in cinemas, I would like to praise the praise for this, as well as Dawson and Faust. Too bad it was too trivial for a widespread appeal. Movies like this deserve better!
