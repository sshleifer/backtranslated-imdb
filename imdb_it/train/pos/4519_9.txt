Julie Waters is exceptional and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and extraordinarily funny look at the complications of dysphoria and transvestism in the life of a young executive. The heart of this film is the true truth that you have to accept yourself before you can hope others will accept you.
