I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did a great job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is wonderful with a fantastic body! He did a great job on delivering his lines, as well as turning into George better than Fraser. A great performance for your first big roll! This film is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids have seen this movie numerous times since we bought the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the film, the DVD extras are equally exhilarating. Two thumbs up on this! I highly recommend it to everyone!
