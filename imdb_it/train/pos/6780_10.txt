Colman's performance is aided by the brilliantly written script. The giant Hollywood studios of the 1930s and 1940s were able to copy some elements of the German expressionist film and incorporate them into Hollywood films. excellent use of shadows and light and silhouette. I really liked the scene in which Colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film, and starts to play Otello while his face immediately becomes dark and bad. already the viewer sees the text and the play of Shakespeare take possession of "Tony" and leaves for his journey of destruction. I also liked the dramatic scene of death in the drama, when he becomes exasperated by emotion and strangely accidentally strangles his costar a little too difficult for her to bear. his pleas "tony stop you're hurt me" are chilling and suspicious. you simply don't know if he's going to go over the lines and kill you at any time. the cat and the mouse chase to reveal that the killer was well added 2/3 of the film to add some faster pace and to add the narrative element of the film. Masterpiece by George Cukor. He is a skilled director. Excellent movie Too bad they don't make them like they used to ...
