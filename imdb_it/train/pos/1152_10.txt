The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's spirits is reason enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! There's more! This is a good crackling of daytime TV, downhill movie stars (and up) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius and Cathy Moriarty is splendid. Dialogue is witty and physical humor done with consummate skill. This is a film that will appeal to those who truly love the arts of acting, directing and writing.
