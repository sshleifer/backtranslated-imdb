I never had the suspicion while watching the movie that was meant for the idiot. I always thought this was a hit movie of the late 1990s. But after seeing on the Internet that this was intended for TV, I was shocked because for a TV movie it is absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> The thing that worried me most was the length. I felt that the one on a battle scene should have been removed because it was completely useless. Moreover, he began to drag himself towards the end, as it seemed that the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating storyline with magnificent performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze seemed a bit haggard. I also heard that Gogool, who seemed demented, became a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted by the beautiful African landscapes. Also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this film a 9. Anyway, it's a great movie for television. 8 out of 10.
