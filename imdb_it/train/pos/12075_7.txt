Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 noir film, also featuring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have lasted from fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, his wife with a cheating husband, a nervous wreck. He became one of the best acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she is a cute and young girl who plays the main role. Julia responds to an announcement for a secretary and is immediately hired by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does he know - even if we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front established to get the right woman for this job, a woman without a family and without a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It's a live-in situation; once Julia arrives home, she is on drugs, and when she wakes up, she is told that she is Mrs. Hughes and she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Low budget but still fun - some things, especially in the end, happen too fast, which is why I said the film is too short. However, I recommend it.
