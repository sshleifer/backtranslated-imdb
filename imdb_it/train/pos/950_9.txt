The setting and the actors make this TV movie the best interpretation of Dickens's classic story. George C. Scott is as credible as the rest of the cast. His Scrooge oozes evil until the end of the film. So his character changes to one who is genuinely regretful. The 19th-century English city chosen for the setting creates an environment that fits Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. It's a film that I watch every Christmas with the real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.
