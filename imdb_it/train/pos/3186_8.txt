I find this movie very funny. The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humor is light and clean, and since the plot involving the wrong identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to how this film affects this story. It turns out to be very nice. The performance of the female protagonist is admirable; his portrait of an innocent and naive girl trying to make some white lies for David's sophisticated role was very fascinating. I also find that Vera is dancing very, very well. I find myself drawn to the toes while dancing on stage without effort and impeccably. <br /> <br /> For those who have had enough of films full of bad words today, you'll like this movie thoroughly.
