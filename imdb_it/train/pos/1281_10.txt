This film is as good as it is hard to find. The hero of the film (and writer and director) is Simon Geist - a man "with an agenda". He creates a fake magazine only to have the authority to interview the Los Angeles pigs - the actors, the models, the musicians - who believe that their defecation has no smell. With an intelligent dialogue, Zucovic manages to do it. Of course, the budget for this film was probably the one that paid for a used car, but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Any person who can conjure up "The Scream" by Edward Munk in the reflection of a silver dustbin in a local cafe should be nominated for some kind of prize. Give this film a chance and listen to what it says ... because they've been doing the same machine since 1986 ... it's called 'the car'. Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
