Words are not enough to convey the emotional power of this film; it is one of the most amazing you can ever see, yet the ending is one of the most affectionate, tender and emotionally rewarding that you can hope for. Every actor in every role is terrifying, especially a wise and underrated Jamie Lee Curtis, an injured and anguished Ray Liotta, and a breakthrough by Tom Hulce who should have given him the prize for each award in the book. (He is the number one choice for the best actor in 1988 in Danny Peary's "Alternate Oscars".) The last half hour borders on melodrama, but the film earns all his tears - and if you're not made of stone, there will be many of them.
