I wouldn't go so far as not to recommend this movie, since the only problems I have with it are due to overexposure to the plot devices used in the film - the kind of things common to all children's movies that have ever been made to look . It's not bad, it's not something I'd like to go far. <br /> <br /> It's a bit mushy, so I could say that for the most part anyone who is looking for something with a little more spirit might be disappointed in a film obviously for kids like this. <br /> <br /> However, all this goes out the window when that squirrel (the one in all the trailers) comes on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems clear that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these kids' hey, could you attack a little more squirrel? 'each time it becomes intolerably boring. This doesn't save the film, but you can say "at least there was one aspect where I couldn't stop laughing". <br /> <br /> And of course, visually it won't disappoint, but it's almost a given with Pixar gestures. Of all their stuff, I'd put it down ... but this isn't bad by itself.
