I originally reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and blew it up. I think I called it "miserable" and a "turkey". Okay, well, for most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no production value, the little plot there is almost no sense and the acting is at the level of a third grade comedy. That being said, this has grown on me over the years as a kind of field classic. In fact, all the films of director Todd Sheets have had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood in this sense: look at them over and over again and choose the lined lines, the errors of continuity (the same zombie, two different places!) And other defects. <br /> <br /> Say this: Sheets is a very nice guy, and while this, one of his first productions, is not great, it has improved. And I have to add that the only really good actress / actress in the film is Kasey Rousch, although I could be biased, while I was attending school with her.
