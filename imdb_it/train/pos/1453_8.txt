Well, there's a lot of ways to ruin a political thriller. They are usually derivatives or too ambitious, often presenting a totally paranoid and incredible conspiracy. But the town hall does none of the above. The plot is skillfully made, the story is credible. As for the characters, I would say that this film is a solid medium. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His interpretation of a charismatic mayor of New York is superb and proves once again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors today.
