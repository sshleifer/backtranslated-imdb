I have repeatedly looked at this since I thought it was a stupid, goofy and dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not excessively sentimental, as moving as it is on the issues of office politics, adultery and solitude. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that holds your interest, and not everything is revealed as you expected. But, there is enough ingenuity and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.
