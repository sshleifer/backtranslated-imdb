I saw this movie when I was almost a kid and, of course, I was moved to tears by this story about a family of foxes. The fantastic scenery of Hokkaid√¥, the excellent storytelling and, not least, the wonderful soundtrack offer a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers it might be useful to know that the DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I recorded both (DEFA and BR) but I still see only the first one.
