This was a typical B-movie movie from the 1940s, yet it fared beyond his expectations. Why? It has a wonderful plot and is supported by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, as a bad female, of all people. <br /> <br /> When a young woman responds to an ad for a secretary, she definitely gets more than she wanted. The only talents his employers are looking for are the ones that will lead to his disappearance. It seems that Witty and MacReady want to pass them as their daughter-in-law and wife respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and wants to do Foch so that a body can be claimed. <br /> <br /> The film is about how Foch tries to convince city people to believe her and how virtually everything she does is hindered.
