I'm not a big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video library was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I took it for free when the other movies I rented, in both cases I rented it. I loved it, my roommate and I (22 years of Biochemistry and Accounting students) spent the half hour after the film made strange Kung Fu sounds and cast beermat hands at each other. I can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a thin guy who kicks a big guy, beats him, kicks a bigger guy, and so on. Think of Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
