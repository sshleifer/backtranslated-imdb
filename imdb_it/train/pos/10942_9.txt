I'd give this show ten out of ten if it weren't for the farting jokes. You people are so damn sensitive that it's inane! So quick to point out the "racism" of the show and the jokes, but they are also so fast to say ridiculously sexist, pig-like crap like "well, duh, some of these other shows do these jokes a lot better because at least they have hot women ". So disgusting. The abortion jokes are great because, in reality, who takes abortion seriously? At least I'm not a * boring * child. I heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are collaborating to make a film about the sisters who are traveling together. Talk about a movie of the year!
