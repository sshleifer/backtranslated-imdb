Have you ever, or do you have, a pet that was with you among the highest and lowest, with whom you would have been lost without, and who you love, no matter what? Betcha never thought to try the same for you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful and wonderful family film. If you have a weakness for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age. I watched this movie all the time when I was a kid, and now I find that, at sixteen, I love it as much as I did then. I could never decide a favorite character then, and I still don't think I can do it! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but struggling family. I love Chance, and he finally says he finally has a family. Cheesy, yes, but remember that this is meant to be a family movie, and fulfills that role perfectly. Sassy only has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for the young, adventurous case. <br /> <br /> Animals outnumber humans, but obviously most tearful moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie: saving Molly and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives every moment even more emotions and a feeling of swelling that accompanies the heart. I give this 9/10. Compare with (and even better than) Cats and Dogs and Babe.
