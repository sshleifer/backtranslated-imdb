Even longtime Shirley fans can be surprised by "Now and Forever". The film was shot with Paramount's studios ?? not with Shirley's parent company, Twentieth Century Fox ?? in 1934, before the producer Fox Darryl Zanuck had perfected Shirley's successful formula (cute songs, cold hearts for her that melted, young couples to make her play Cupid, happy ending). So "Now and Forever" falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard story of Shirley. It's an awkward position for any film, but this talented and talented cast makes it work. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard play in Jerry and Toni Day, lovers of fun and irresponsible. The only thing that this devoted but dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being together. When they suddenly landed in the custody of Jerry's young daughter, Penny (Shirley Temple), is Toni ?? and not Penny, as many believe ?? who persuades Jerry to give up his criminal career. But Jerry delights in his desk job, and desperate to prove he can provide for his new family, he soon returns to steal and dishonesty. In a standard Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the heart of the cruel brat Felix Evans, victim of one of Jerry's cons, but his attempt fails, because Evans turns out to be a scammer himself, and blackmails Jerry to help him steal jewels. The drama, the firefight, the death and the pain that ensue make this film very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dance and only a sequence of songs (the cute number "The world makes me live"). <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and forever" ". Rather, the divergence from the usual Shirley story makes it more interesting and memorable than many of his other films. : you should avoid the colored version of this film, and see it in black and white if you can The color is bright, flashy and unrealistic, and in many scenes, Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blond.
