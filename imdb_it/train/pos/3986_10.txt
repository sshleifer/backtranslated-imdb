I am a university student who studies the levels and needs help and comments from anyone who has any opinion on the subject of mothers in the film, in the mother. If you have experienced something similar or just want to comment and help me find more about this film, any comment would be greatly appreciated. Comments will be used solely for examination purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any opinions, I'm sure I can use them and you could help me get an A! I'm also studying "About a Boy" and "Tadpole" so if you've seen these films, I'd be grateful if you could leave comments on that page. Thank you.
