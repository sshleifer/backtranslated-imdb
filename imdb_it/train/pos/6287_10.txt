Gone in 60 Seconds is a very good action comedy film that has made over $ 100 million but has been blown up by most critics. Personally, I thought it was a great movie. The story was credible and probably the biggest cast ever for this type of film, including 3 winners of the Nicolas Cage academic award, Robert Duvall and the very exciting Anjolina Jolie. aside from the stunt in the end, this is a perfect mix of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (on ****)
