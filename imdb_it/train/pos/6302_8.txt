I went to see as if my lady and I had had very little to do on a Sunday afternoon, I like movies that deal with shady and shady characters and this is full of em. After a slow start we get some good turns from the cast, but it is the real "Bellini" that both do and let the movie fall. The 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time, but it's too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall 71/2 out of 10
