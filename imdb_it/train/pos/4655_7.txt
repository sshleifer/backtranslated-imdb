Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who is just leaving prison when the movie starts. As soon as he comes out of the gates, he immediately starts working on a scheme to make a bundle again by stealing, even if this time he has his goals firmly in place. This is actually one of the weaknesses of the film, given that apparently he knows nothing about computers (few did in 1968) but he manages to become a computer genius literally during the night! Yeah, for sure. However, he has in mind a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and get a job with a large American company, so he can eventually appropriate a lot of money. Considering his knowledge of the computer is rudimentary, it is incredible how he implements a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But after all it's a movie, so I was able to suspend disbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to escape with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, he becomes very, very confused and Smith announces he managed to accumulate more than two million dollars by investing shrewdly the companies that Ustinov started (even if he didn't realize that all fictitious companies). This should mean that in the end these actions that you bought have no value. What they seem to imply (and I might guess the opposite) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stock before it was announced and the shares would then become useless. However, the film seems to publish a magical ending for which nobody is hurt and everyone is happy - and that doesn't make much sense. It's a real shame, as the acting and most of the writing were great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> If it seems to me to have played the end, let me know, since the film seemed very vague in the details at the end.
