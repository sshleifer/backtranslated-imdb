This film is a true and historical film. It is very useful for those searching for the LDS church, because it is 100% true. It's an excellent film and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is very concrete, exciting and motivating. There are some who think it is not a fact, but it is. <br /> <br /> It concerns the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who restored it. He had similar events in his life as the illness he had when he was a kid, his courting Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, giving birth, and so on. But above all, it reveals the restoration of the church.
