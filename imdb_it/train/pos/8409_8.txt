A good movie and one I will watch a number of times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there is much more here than is clear from the title tables, and I must ask myself how much he suffered in the translation. Were there more in the original? Or did a native speaker expect to read more? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which this was based - was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, it's worth a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than what the original 1913 audience had to insert. <br /> <br /> The release of Alpha Video appreciates the new organ score, but the music is not corresponding to the progression of the story in any way. Of course, it starts off promising, but degenerates into a repetitive monotony similar to Phillip Glass that reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and simply looked: much better!
