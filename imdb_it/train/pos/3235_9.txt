Excellent film, a realistic image of contemporary, touching and profound Finland. One of the best Finnish films ever made. It captures wonderful daily life in a small town in central Finland, the desires and weaknesses of the people, the joys and sorrows. The bright morning sun of autumn creates a fresh atmosphere for this lucid analysis of people in a welfare society. Lampela is in fact one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. Show that it is possible to make compelling films without machine guns and bloodshed. Even his next film, Eila, deserves to be seen, although the story of cleaning women who struggle for their work is not as universally attractive as the destinies of Joki.
