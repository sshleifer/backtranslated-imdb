Why does a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley play in this common film ??? !!! The cast gives a good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a motherless girl and Justin Whalin, a boy eternally diminished by his disorder), but the management is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can't believe a movie like this has been produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): are you MAD ??? !!!
