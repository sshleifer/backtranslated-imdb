I really liked the movie. Surely it will leave the public eager to learn more, and there is really much more to discover historically! <br /> <br /> Has the production team fallen into the temptation of dramatization, particularly the shooting event? Is there a lot of interesting and interesting material mentioned? Prince Albert's contribution to the United Kingdom and the monarchy guarantees a film of his own, but he acknowledged that apparently it is not part of the intention here. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the sets are particularly good but I am only thinking that this production (which judging by the length of the titles in the end was certainly not cheap) was bad for an expert in the history of British Court over the Duchess of York? For example, did Princess Victoria really put a whole truffle / meatball (?) In her mouth while talking to the Prime Minister in the company of Her Majesty with a full mouth? <br /> <br /> 'I could never really like Victoria in this film, or even in his shoes. Yet he loved the headmaster casting, whose acting was convincing, so did the script really let us know them really well? I always felt like a completely detached and uninformed outside observer, much more than with "Mrs. Brown" or even "The Queen". However, to be honest, I still couldn't take my eyes off the screen, except for some of the most cutting-edge camera techniques that distracted me from time to time.
