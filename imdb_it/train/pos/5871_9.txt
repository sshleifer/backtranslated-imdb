I love every single frame of this beautiful film. These are normal people, people we all know, who suffer a little in their lives and have some luggage to carry around. Just like all of us. Robert De Niro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker give life to their portraits and they are all excellent, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and therefore very real. You'd swear it's really a truck driver who drinks, so he won't have to hear anything. Baker as his putate sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in a scene, it seems that they have never been given flowers before and probably he wasn't. Very helpful.
