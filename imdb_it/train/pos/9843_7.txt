He put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together (not to mention, trying to save a human child and bring him back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as best friends. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it's (made only through 20th Century Fox). The trailer for the film was one of the best I've seen in a long time, but the film does not live up to the expectations of the trailer. The problem is that the film's creators have not made the decision who the film's target audience is. Yes, there are some lines in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mainly aimed at children. Parents will appreciate that for 90 minutes. their children's attention is focused on something different from them. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice is good but this is nothing but a good movie. Kids will love this movie, adults will only like this.
