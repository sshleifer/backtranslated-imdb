I saw this with little expectation and absolutely adorable! Fold it as if Beckham were a typical training film about a rather atypical girl. This is the pivotal role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a teenager in England who is caught between his traditional Indian family and his love of football (which is football for us North Americans). And although he is actually much older than his character, he plays the perfectly perfect role. <br /> <br /> This is a friendship film - in particular Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), his teammate who is also going through family problems, particularly with his mother, who she wears purple nail polish and small bows on her shoes, and wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lace underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love to play and have trouble trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. Also, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes a certain tension in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, the scenes drag on too long, and probably this film could have benefited from a more complex editing. <br /> <br /> But this was a fun and entertaining film about growth, cultural confrontation and love for football. It's about women's empowerment, chasing your dreams and supporting your friends. Fun, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and did it. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
