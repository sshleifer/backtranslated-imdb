When I first discovered that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to understand that I saw the original of this and loved it. So I had even more reasons to look. Well, I looked. It was actually better than most TV sequels. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and I didn't like most of the characters, including Brian's. But the film needed scurrilous and annoying characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. In the end, I was rooting for Stanley and his happy ending. If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without blood, I suggest you watch it.
