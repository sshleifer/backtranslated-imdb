Visconti's first film has all its distinctive mark and its immaculate technique, accompanied by convincing interpretations of Massimo Girotti as the beautiful vagabond and, above all, Clara Calamai as the fabulous and frenetic Giovanna. Remade several times as 'The Postman Rings Twice' but never improved. I can't believe this was the first man movie! Show someone's confidence at the peak of their career.
