My brother brought this movie home from the rental store and I remember expecting it to be so boring. I think the title has particularly discouraged me. I can never remember having started a film with such low expectations and being so completely conquered. I saw the movie twice before letting my brother take it to the store. It is very rare for a film to talk to me about how he did this. I was completely caught up in Ruby's situation as she tried to make her way in her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I may have continued to watch for hours. Another downside is that I was dissatisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since. She is so perfect in this movie. This film is easily one of my top ten favorites of all time.
