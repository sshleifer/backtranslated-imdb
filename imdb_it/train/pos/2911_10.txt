This is one of the best music concerts that anyone will see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was brand new and to hear it again today from the original artist is a measure of Sir P Mc's power to enchant any crowd of any age. This show goes backstage to show us life on the street not just for the band, but for all the roadies. I saw this guy live in the Aussie 1975 and I can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is not inferior to the one he gave almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does justice and I would recommend to anyone, in particular, a Beatles fan. This is the closest to a Beatles concert today. Singer, Songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few entertainers who can stand alone with an instrument and hold the crowd. If you want to listen to perfect music, buy a CD recorded in the studio. If you want to listen to the raw music as it is and spontaneous to the crowd, with all the excitement and excitement of the crowd, this DVD is for you.
