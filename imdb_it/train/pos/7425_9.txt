Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in this Hollywood story. His performances and songs are unique in their genre and are special in the halls of great films. The scene in which Kristopherson's unexpected audience is presented, against the crowd's desires and crowds, just to shoot them around with his magnificent performance of "Woman In the Moon" is one of the best examples on the film of how great a performer can win over an audience. It's true. The scene in which you record Evergreen is at the top of the best in the business world .. all live, no lip-sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a Diva, but she offers this. She is majestic in singing "With One More Look At You. She deserved the Oscar she and Paul Williams had for Evergreen." Kristopherson also had his moments, far above most of his film appearances. one from 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March), although I'll always have fun with Judy Garland and James Mason, a 1954 music remake. I haven't seen the DVD yet and I don't know the quality.
