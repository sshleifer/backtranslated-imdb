I really liked this way of assuming the personality of Dick Tracy. This is a well-made product that has used modern technology to create a comics story full of images. If you are a fan or have recently seen some of Dick Tracy's old black and white movies, then you are sure to get a kick from this version. Pastel colors and life's biggest characters, rendered in a careful and authentic interpretation of a bygone era, are entertainment as it should be. Personally I find that the musical element of Madonna is an important part of this film - the CD with its music from this film is one of those that I have listened to often over the years, it is so well done and performed musically and tuned to that 'was. In my mind, the most beautiful moment of Madonna is on the screen, but above all musically. This is sure to bring out the "baby" in you.
