Very slow, but with a complex structure and very touching in the end. A beautiful, very realistic look in a small Florida seaside town in the heart of winter - I've been there, and that's absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It's also actress Ashley Judd's debut film, and she makes a great impression here. It's hard to believe that this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters, and I recently rented "Ruby" again. Except for the 1980s, clothes looked well made. Ashely is so radiant and touching here, that it's hard to think of her next career without making a face. Boy, talk about not being able to fulfill your initial promise! Anyone who saw Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would have admitted that this elegant and natural beauty went to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting - instead she became the "go to" girl for stupid action movies and slasher movie! Very disappointing, but at least we kept this beautiful show to show its initial promise. <br /> <br /> As other commentators say, this is not for everyone as it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it really a love story. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent study of the characters) treats the life of this ordinary young woman with profound respect, allowing her story to build slowly and with many details. In this way, I think this is one of the most moving and respectful stories about the growth of young women that I can remember - it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity", but about her life choices and his growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A nice movie, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really excellent movie to show teenagers and girls (or kids for that subject) and give them the chance to think about it and discuss it . <br /> <br /> Particular congratulations to the director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and well detailed that I assumed throughout the film that it was based on a novel or a memory written by women, but in reality is the original work of Mr. Nunez. Rated 8 out of 10.
