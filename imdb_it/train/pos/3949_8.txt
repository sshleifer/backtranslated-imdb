Like many people on this site, I only saw this film once, when it was first broadcast in 1971. Some scenes linger in my memory and a general feeling of unease is how I remember being influenced by it. I would be fascinated to see it again, if it had been made available for home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setting and characters could be derived from a 1960 British film, originally titled City of the Dead , was Horror Hotel named for the American release? There are also some similarities with the later British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> A detail remains with me years after seeing the film. It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. If I remember correctly, a minister and his wife stopped to help some people by the side of the road, around 1870, somewhere out of the west. The apparent friendly Ray Milland presents himself and his (daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young dumb woman. While the preacher is helping Ray Milland with the cart, a rattlesnake slides into view and wraps itself threateningly, unnoticed by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She doesn't look scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration, until she leaves. With this strange little moment, we realize that there is something very unusual about these apparently normal people, even if the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> That little scene stays with me vividly after all these years, along with many others. The film has an obsessive quality that won't let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make it available for home video!
