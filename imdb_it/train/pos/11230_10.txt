Hidden Frontier has been discussed and reported by several news agencies for their long-standing efforts in creating the best Star Trek stories and to provide an example of solidarity that was the mission of Gene Roddenberry. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is equal to or greater than those of other Trek series and films. The value of the production started as smaller and choppy, but during the 7 production seasons the acting has improved, the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have become smoother and more impressive. In episode 1 of season 6, Countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek's history. The ships are well made and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real appeal to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but the people and the interaction and growth of the characters. There are also references to other series of Treks and films with places and characters that we all know. I recommend Trek fans to check the countermeasures and you will be kidnapped!
