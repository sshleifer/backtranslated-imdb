As a matter of fact, this is one of those movies that you should give 7.5. The thing is; as already mentioned, it's a lot of fun. Wonderfully suggestive. Askey, in fact, is in a top position, but it's a great vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will Hay. If you like old movies and dark house trains, then this is definitely for you. Strangely, it's the kind of movie you'll want to see again and again. He is friendly and charming in a captivating way with all the nostalgic references that have made life great in wartime. The "strange" band of characters simply play each other like they do in many other typical British war movies. It would have been wonderful to see this film if it had been recorded by Ealing studios. A pity that the 1931 original did not survive intact
