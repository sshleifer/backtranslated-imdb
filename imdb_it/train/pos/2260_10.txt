A DAMAGING FILM! One that is seriously undervalued. The songs that the children sing in the film gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg offers a good performance here, but the best performance of the entire film is that of the actress who plays the title character. I wish it was in other movies. <br /> <br /> This film should have a higher rating. I give him a 10/10.
