Passing the stones is certainly one of the best independent films of the comedy of all time. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this. This film for some reason did not receive its due credit. First of all, let's start with the plot that everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters behind the advice of a hidden treasure, he not only brings together two families but starts a whirlwind adventure. Mixing a Polish translator, a comatose mother, a crack head with turret syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist and a drag queen, money not only makes the world go round but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie should be the drug addict sister / turret with her turret syndrome, her sudden explosion will make you cry and imitate for weeks.
