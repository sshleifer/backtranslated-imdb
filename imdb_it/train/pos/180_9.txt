When Gundam0079 became the film trilogy with which many of us are familiar, much of it was pure action and less than anything else. This OVA is the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not full of action, but of emotional things. The two main action sequences in this, I believe, are sufficient to satisfy me. After seeing so many gundam series, movies and OAVs, I was completely ready for a civil law film. This film has done a fantastic job. What distinguishes this film is that it shows that both sides of the war have good and bad people. He made the Zeons look more human than the original films in which they are depicted as the second ascent of evil Nazis. Most people who don't like souls that I forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. So I would recommend it to many people just for the anti-war story. If you are a Gundam fan and haven't seen it, you shouldn't read it; you should already watch it now.
