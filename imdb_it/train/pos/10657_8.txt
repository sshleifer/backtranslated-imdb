Jeopardy has the feeling of being a series movie: one of the films that the studios have pumped between budget and box office. It's only 70 minutes and doesn't have many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a tough woman again as he runs into a convict on the run while seeking help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. Most of the film focuses on how she relates to her kidnapper, who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological fights there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it tense, and that Stanwyck is great should go without mention (but I'll praise it every time).
