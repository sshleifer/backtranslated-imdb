This extraordinary Academy Award (4 in total) and John Ford's first Academy Award-winning is simply fascinating with a pounding score by Max Steiner. Called an art film, because Ford had very little money to make this fantastic story of guilt and punishment, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film so classic is the direction and stunning photography and the use of fog and lighting, which was so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And Victor McLaglen's Oscar-winning performance as drunk Gypo is simply incredible. Basically the film takes place in Ireland, and Gypo turns into a friend in the English rebel movement to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But having all that money, he starts blowing it all night drinking it and giving it away, while the movement's leaders are trying to track down the informant. The whole film is a night in a dark and foggy Ireland, and a cast of characters that are memorable but always, the whole world of Gypo is approaching him, both psychologically. If I had to choose maybe three directors to have ALL their films on a deserted island forever, and nobody would be, John Ford would surely be one of them. What a truly remarkable film ...
