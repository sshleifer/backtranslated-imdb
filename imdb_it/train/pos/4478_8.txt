Overall this is a delightful, light, romantic, musical comedy. I suppose a small case can be made for the film to be too long. But I'm not sure what you would cut. The song that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. The fabulous dance that Kelly does? No. How long does it take for the film to develop the plot and develop character relationships? No (it seems to be a common complaint many times that newer films don't develop characters). <br /> <br /> Some comment that Iturbi did not bring much to the film, but this gives us the opportunity to see and listen to a great talent from the 40s. What if he wasn't an actor? It was an important part of the film since the basic plot was to bring Grayson an audition with him. <br /> <br /> Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be a star of the opera. Louis B. Mayer took her to the MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During his audition in the film there is a photo of the MGM brass that nods and smiles. You can only imagine that this was the case when he made his real screen screen years ago. <br /> <br /> This film is so full of life that it's hard to find all the highlights. Great use was made of colors and lights during the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he made. A nice counter-point in the film is how Sinatra (a gentleman, even then) played the role of wanting to find a licensed date. You'll feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
