As creator of "This Darkness", I admit that we have overlooked 3 very important awards in our credits. The omissions were excessive visions that could not be corrected once committed, nor the parties involved --- who had seen the film --- mentioning it at the time. On behalf of the film's excellent cast and crew, I apologize to them. Obviously, some criticisms published here are harsh in light of the fact that their credit is accidentally. Our production values ​​were negligible and our "special effects" were very special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod's cinematography is superb. We hope you, the reader, enjoy "This Darkness" and the efforts of those who have stopped playing. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, director.
