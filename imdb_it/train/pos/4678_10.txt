I chose to watch this movie at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it one of the best films of the festival. Both main actors offer a well-rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job bringing the characters and the story to life with skills that are usually not seen in a first production. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodworking and New York City (Brooklyn in particular). Does the film revolve around family furniture that does business and weaves a delicate cinematography of both the joinery and ordinary life in Brooklyn ?? once again I congratulate the director on this beautiful choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem and I would recommend it wholeheartedly (I'm sure it will on screen).
