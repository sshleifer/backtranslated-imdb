The children I took in this film loved it (four children aged 9 to 12 would have given them 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the title role. (Expect to see more next-generation stuff in the future.) After being exposed to characters like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was nice to see a girl who didn't seem to have worked roads. I also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with a cameo by Bruce Willis). Final takeaway: Cute movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I did not read the book series, so my comments are based solely on the merit of the film).
