I discovered the film "Fori" listening to people that it was not typical Disney, that both children and adults both took part in the story. People, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange juvenile detention camp in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they set off on the adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting story, unique, different and fun. I didn't know what to expect when I saw it. It was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the young delinquents were all very funny and Jon Voight was as hilarious as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. More recommended!
