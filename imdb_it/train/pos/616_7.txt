If a style of film could be called my "guilty pleasure", it would be this kind of generic fantasy. Guilty is the wrong word, though, since I'm happy enough to be a tax evader from time to time. "Stardust" is a good stock of fantasy, which should be expected from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman's adaptation, so to speak). It is not the visual script of Mirrormask's dream, it is not the adult claim of Pan's Labyrinth, and it is not the classic lover of fun The Princess Bride, but it contains just what the fantasy lover is already quite familiar with to be completely in comfortable during the whole vision. Fantasy lovers should rejoice: the work on special effects has finally become quite good and cheap that this stuff is in regular production now. <br /> <br /> The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who, to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of Wall, embarks on an adventure to recover a fallen star. To make things difficult, however, Tristan's shooting star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and she's not the only one looking for her ... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality that the heart of the star can give , and a feud of a brother on the magical kingdom leads killer principles in his direction. <br /> <br /> From there it's all quite predictable, but it involves some elements of attractive fantasy, some warm comments about the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. In this note, DeNiro's performance is apt ... it's not the excessive clarity that most actors use to portray homosexuals, but one surprisingly effective by someone was seen as a typically rough and rough character (so the one current joke surrounding his character, matching the same opening of DeNiro to alternative forms of acting). DeNiro was not so unique for his image from Brazil, and this is saying something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is the type of film, perhaps, that will last for a long time on the shelves of children and fantasy lovers. . I can't say that it offers something new, but it's not right there. In reality they are the ones who are most familiar with its tropes that will appreciate it the most. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
