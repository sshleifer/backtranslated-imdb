I am embarrassed to say that I missed "The Mother" when he was in the theaters. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave a vote of 10, one of the very few I gave here. This independent English is shot with so much care and quality. It has attracted me relentlessly. The story, low impact and purely human, is brutally honest and completely absorbing, thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. Cinematography is amazing. The score is well connected to the plot. The plot is epic, beautifully dressed by writer Hanif Kureishi in worldly lives. This story faces great problems with the subtlety of an Impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite many appointments. It's simply one of my favorite movies of all time.
