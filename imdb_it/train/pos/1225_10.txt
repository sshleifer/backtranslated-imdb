Does anyone know where or how can I get a copy of this movie? !! I searched too long, someone helps me! In 1997, my girlfriend and I had appeared in this movie on Long Island, and we never actually saw it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping to find a copy somehow so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! There's someone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so I can stop making me going crazy (even if it doesn't matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age.) If you or someone you know, has a copy of this movie, please help me, I'd pay for a good copy of it!
