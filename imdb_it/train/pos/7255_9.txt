This is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most of the people I know wouldn't do that. <br /> <br /> The portrait of cruelty to the body and the mind that occurs in a war quite well, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds", something that is more often found in books and rarely in movies, but it was very well done in this piece. I would place it next to "All quiet on the western front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could project it at school, along with the other two films - however finding a copy of it proved rather difficult - which is a shame.
