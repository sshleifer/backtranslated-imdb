<br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. One of those rare films that Hollywood Really doesn't make anymore. William H Macy is simply as fantastic as the hired man with a soul, and Neve Campbell is just as fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the redemption trail. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, see this movie. Earn is praise
