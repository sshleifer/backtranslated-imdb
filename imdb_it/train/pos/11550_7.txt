If you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film, you will remain with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good movie, which is no small feat considering the coma that got me into the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a sad beginning that wasn't even remotely funny, or even optimistic. Once things get sillier, however, you still have a comedy that still holds up well after more than thirty years. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see their previous work.
