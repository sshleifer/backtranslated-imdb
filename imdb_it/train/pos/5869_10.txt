having just seen The Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, the film Jacknife had big shoes to fill has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this film, as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here, as is Kathy Baker. But this film belongs to Ed Harris, which offers a powerful, emotional and impactful performance. The film is based on a theatrical game, and there are one or two scenes where it seemed obvious to me. By this I mean only that for those one or two scenes it seemed to me to attend a theatrical performance. It wasn't a big deal, and actually it doesn't diminish the film. This movie is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They have a similar era and have similar themes, but they are two very different films. I thought The Deer Hunter was awesome, and I also think this movie was fantastic in this which makes it so great. For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
