This film caught me off guard when it started in a bar in Arizona and Richard Grieco (Rex), "Dead Easy" on 04, decides to eat something and gets hot and annoyed for a hot, sexy waitress. While Rex leaves the Caf√©, he sees a police officer and asks him "ARE YOU FAST?" and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", 1980s, is a television reporter and is always looking for news to spread. Maggie ends up in a hot tub and Rex comes to call her to tell her that she wants a western-style show down with the local cop in town. This is a different film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who help this picture TOGETHER!
