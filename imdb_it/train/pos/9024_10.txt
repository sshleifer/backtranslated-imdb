Five years from the survivors of Tenko returning home, and from Marion's double cut "Well, that's that". <br /> <br /> It's 1950, time for the meeting. The band is all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica and the newcomers Maggie and Alice. The story that takes place is of beaut: perfectly written and recited, and stimulating and moving, like the original series. <br /> <br /> All questions left unanswered at the end of the series are well provided here. From Marion's family to Joss's health center, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the better. <br /> <br /> A trip to the Dominica plantation brings a lot of shocks and some really edge-of-the-seat tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster, because, once again, fate takes over and women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows its true colors, and there are some moments of dramatic drama. <br /> <br /> Filming of lush locations in Singapore and the opportunity to meet a group of women who feel they have become friends. It is a pity that this is really the end. I could watch it again. Perfection.
