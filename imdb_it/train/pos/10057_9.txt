I was going to sleep with my girlfriend last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I reversed the channels until I came across this Chinese movie called King of Masks. At first I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it, and then it immediately caught me and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The girl in the film was absolutely adorable. He was a fantastic actor for being so small. Perhaps the fact that he was in Chinese, so English was nicknamed made it more difficult for me to tell it ... but it really seemed to have a perfect character. I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her "boss", but it turned out to be rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another nephew, just so he can pass on his art ... it turns out that that child was kidnapped, so he is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... whatever you touch in trying to be nice to your grandfather, backfires. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks ... which is just so moving after all the misadventures of the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely a jewel, and totally original. <br /> <br /> Scott
