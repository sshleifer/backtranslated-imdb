Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurer films that were popular in the 1980s. Wayne Crawford plays Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights the wicked wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) he turns the trot to look for some action (and some decent lines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister was kidnapped by an evil white slave trader (John Hurt). Can you find and convince Jake and Desmond to help you save your brother? <br /> <br /> A cheesy and mischievous film that does not claim to be something it is not. I have to give this a recommendation. This is if you like movies that they love to have fun and those that don't take everything at face value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
