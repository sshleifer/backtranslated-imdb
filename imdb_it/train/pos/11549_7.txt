There is nothing that she doesn't like about "The Odd Couple", and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau form an enormously winning comic team. But there is something so underdeveloped in Neil Simon's adaptation of his highly successful stage to make it look more like a skit than a comic sketch than a full-bodied movie. I have not seen the game, but I have to assume that the version of the screen is quite faithful, since Simon wrote it, so the defects cannot be blamed in an adaptation from one stage to another. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows otherwise - that Simon has never fully developed. However, there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours.
