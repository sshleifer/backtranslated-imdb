I read Holes in fifth grade, so when I heard they were making a movie I was ecstatic! Of course, since my self was busy, I didn't have the chance to see the film in theaters. Holes was at the drive-in just outside the city but, alas, we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and none of them had invited me! Everyone said it was fine, but I read fantastic books that made crappy movies so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came. He was out that week and my parents were cruising, and I was babysitting. My sister, who is 9, looked at her and absolutely loved her! Then I took it to the other people I was babysitting and their children, 9 and 4, I liked too. Even my parents loved it and are deffinately film critics. Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands family morale and loves an exhilarating cast! This movie should be on your list of top 5 "must see" !!!!
