Given the low budget and production limits, this film is very good. It is plausible, realistic, and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian knights who lived in the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save an American pilot shot down by the ruthless and savage Nazis. We are attracted by strong feelings for the young, impressionable, but very brave boy - who admires the American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, superman heroes and magical endings - this film is not for you.If you want to hear what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will remain fascinated by this film, I loved it and for those who love horses, dogs and humble and helpful people who appreciate freedom and those who aspire to this end, this film will be one you will remember for a long time.
