Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This film wraps the table with a group of friends, some like you, others don't. Some are related: mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth, happy with everyone and everything, the kind of life - very similar to real life. Some narrative lines do not evolve, they simply happen. But like real families and good friends, they remain united. Parents who want to buy a baby are real holes! You are happy for the ending. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mother, her son and trying to hold all their lives together. This does not end with a walk at sunset or a house in the "suburbs" and everyone lives in a dream world, but it is a real representation of the life of people who live every day, month after month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie !!
