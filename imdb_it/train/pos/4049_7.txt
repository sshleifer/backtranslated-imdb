"L'Anglaise et le duc" by Erich Rohmer is a perfect complement to "La Commune (Paris 1871)" by Peter Watkins. Both films, screened this year at the Toronto International Film Festival, ironically illustrate how the story was shaped by the story tellers. Ironic, given the tragic events that were occurring in the United States during the festival. <br /> <br /> Set in Paris during the French Revolution, the film, based on "Memoirs" by Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell), is a first-hand account of how it survived those heady but dangerous days. He also details his relationship with The Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), which, contrary to itself, is a supporter of the revolution. <br /> <br /> True to form, you don't know whose side of the Rohmer story is about to come down. One of the first French filmmakers of the "New Wave", Rohmer was often criticized for being too conservative. After all, in the midst of the rebellious-youthful Vietnam-days of the late 1960s and 1970s, he was filming small, romantic packages like "Claire's Knee". But don't sell the old boy soon, folks, he's always been a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" continues to give its light. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" or the "good guys", they are first and foremost human beings who are able to exhibit a full range of human potential - and limitations. That's why his films are always provocative and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now for technology and bullying. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, although he is making his way to his 80s, is still at the forefront of film innovation. The Anglaise "is something you've never seen before. You guessed it, the old man - like many of the festival's directors this year - has become digital. <br /> <br /> All the external scenes in the film seem as if they took place in their original Parisian settings of 1780. In fact, you might be so distracted by the wonder of the film's authenticity that I should go back for a second screening to capture the subtleties of the psychological film - and yes, I'll say it - political insights. <br /> <br /> Toronto presents some of the youngest young directors in the world this year, as well as some of the oldest in the world, and the old masters are standing there on the frontiers of cinema right next to the young. /> <br /> Long live the youth. Long live the old age. And long life to Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
