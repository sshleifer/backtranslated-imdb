I saw this film only once about 25 years ago, and until now I've always told people that it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and only dialogue on thought, I found the film fascinating and I even found myself holding my breath to not make any sound. I highly recommend this movie, I wish it was available on DVD.
