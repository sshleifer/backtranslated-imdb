This was a well-written story of the Making of the Batman Sitcom and actually brings together our heroes in a great quest as well as offering their TV series history. Unlike the family documentary films of Brady and Partridge, we not only take a look at the past and present lives of Adam and Burt, but we also manage to see them in action again. Filled with Kapow, Catwomen and Riddler, Batman has come back very well, a story that not only gives us a satisfying end to the Batman series, but fills the modern fan with all the Hollywood stories about them that have listened to in 35 years. Congratulations !!!
