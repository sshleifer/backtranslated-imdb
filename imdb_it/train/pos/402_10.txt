I've already seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that film, the setting takes place in the mountains of China, the legend of Zu seems another dimension !! Thanks to this extensive use of CGI effects by Tsui Hark. He is able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor-sharp wing blades to divided swords, and the ultra-cold Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> While there are many characters in this, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic aspect is there, even if the film seems much more obscure than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this film worth seeing. At first, I like how she looks like the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she plays Enigma well while facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very eye-catching ?? <br /> <br /> Actually, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
