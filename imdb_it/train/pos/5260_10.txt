Yes, it could be stupid and it might not sound as fun as many high-budget comedies, but this movie is really fun if you really watch it. Tim Meadows has always struck me for the fun side of the Saturday Night Live show. Every time he made this character in the show I would have laughed. So, after seeing that he would play on Comedy Central one evening, I decided to try it. All in all I was very impressed with this film because it was not destined to win an Oscar or become a comedy of the year, but entertained Saturday Night Live fans who love the character of Ladies Man. This film is also full of some lines highly quotable that can be recited in the years to come.
