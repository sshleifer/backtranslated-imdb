I took it in a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was struck by the absolute power of this film. It is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the army with the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor and will be treated by our government for this. The film details the psychological changes taking place in the training camp when soldiers are transformed into "murderers for their country" and put into war and side effects once they return home. It also describes the effect that killing has on the human psyche. It pays homage to Soldiers and never criticizes soldiers unlike other films, but criticizes a system that is not prepared and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of returned veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This film is powerful, moving, emotional and inspiring. This is a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parade, but actually listening to them, and helping to sustain a change in the way their health and well-being are cared for after the end of the killing . <br /> <br /> The best film of the Festival so far, **** / ****
