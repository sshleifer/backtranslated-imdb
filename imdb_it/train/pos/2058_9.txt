This film is an interesting interpretation of the killer scarecrow genre - incredibly it manages to rise to become larger than the sum of its parts. Medium-sized scenes, teenagers in their thirties and some excellent facial expressions come together to become one of the "new waves" of modern classics. As a spectator, I came out of the film with the same sense of "shock and awe" as when I saw The Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner's surprisingly morally bankrupt interpretation of Judy deserved her Grammy nomination, which was well documented stolen by Ricky Martin and the restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the sequels could meet the expectations of the original (unlike the Godfather series which improved with each episode, and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.
