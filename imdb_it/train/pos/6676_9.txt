****** WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> So who are these "Mystery Men?" Put simply, Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes who desperately try to live their teenage fantasy lives, affecting both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works during the day and, at night, he leaves his wife and children at home while he walks down the street in search of crimes to deal with his extraordinary and unique paddle style of fighting. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to new brides during the day and throws crockery at the nightly crackpots, if his mother is not keeping him busy with the last snooping. Mr. Furious works in a garbage dump to earn his pay, then brings out the frustration of his friends at night, rude jokes about friends and enemies alike and threatening to really get angry (leaving everyone wondering, So What? ). Ben Stiller breathes so much life into this character, you can't help but love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights trying to capture the "moment of glory" they dreamed of ... becoming real Superheroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has the Surprising Captain, after all ... a flying super-cop and fought with enough company logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns into a stellar performance like a middle-aged exhaustion trying to catch the attention of his fans in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back that "extra magic" that the endors, C.A. release Casanova Frankenstein, an over-the-top WAAAAAY threat played to the chilling perfection of Goeffrey Rush. This moody genius has created a "psychofrakulator" to transform Champion City into a reflection of his own madness ... and ends up capturing AC. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent on the team, with his mystical bowling ball apparently animated by the vengeful spirit of his late father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who ASKS to become invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is watching him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much-neglected Sphinx (Wes Studi), which proves able to cut the cannons in half with his mind, then spends most of the rest of the film throwing unworthy puzzles and acting excessively. <br /> <br /> This movie is really an inter-genre game. Anyone who wants to shoot pigeons in small and simple categories is fighting a lost battle. This is a parody / parody of the superhero genre - from pseudo-Burton sets recycled to infinity (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to ridiculous costumes, the comic book genre gets a good success. But at the same time it is also a serious superhero movie. Both at once. Although it is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is somewhat reflective of D.C. Comic's five lower works), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It offers the world of comics that requires a suspension of disbelief to be accepted in any case, then launches the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if the superheroes were real, so would these real boys. If the Big Guy with the S flew to the city of New York, you would see half a dozen news stories of idiots in their underwear kicking their pants regularly. Of course, the Shoveller fights quite well, and the Blue Raja launches great precision - all parts of the superhero world. But does this make them real superheroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This film is also a comedy, even if obscure. Inevitable, when trying to indicate the ridiculous nature of superhero patents. The one-liners fly as the cartoon genes on stage launch numerous pieces to play from. Especially wonderful is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball / father. However, it is not a comedy in the sense of cracking laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never ventures completely into any of them. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie in the end is that it's very engaging. The good / weak good guys are finally justified and, for a brilliant moment, they really become superheroes; justice is served; and the film ends with a scene that exudes realism (as much realism as is possible in a world in which bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the spectator stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great show. <br /> <br /> Of course, no film is perfect. Claire Forlani is as bored and meaningless as Mr. Furious's love interest, despite having a fundamental role as her conscience. Tom Waits seems somewhat confused by his own words as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, even though his opening scenes that collect retired ladies in the nursing home deserve to be seen alone. And the villagers are never more armed lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is moved and decomposed (as it happens in the average comic, so it is excusable), the music sometimes dominates the scenario, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well. <br /> <br /> However, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really enjoy this movie, but it's fun and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 according to me.
