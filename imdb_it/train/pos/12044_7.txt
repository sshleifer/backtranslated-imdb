A young lawyer was sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a deceased client. When he arrives, he discovers that he is made less welcome by the villagers and that his late customer did not like it. To speed things up, he decides to move from the local inn and settle in his house, a house that is usually crowded and only comes close to a causeway that is blocked by the sea for most of the day. Once there he sees the visions of a woman in black, is real or imaginary, is also subject to the bloody cries of a woamn and to the child who seems to drown in the marshes, these events give him their toll and soon becomes quite terrified. Atmospheric television adaptation of a famous Susan Hill comedy, which spends him for the first time building his characters, before moving into a creepy country house, his poor color contrast immediately betrays his television roots, this in actually it should have been in black and white, but still like a ghost story it had a couple of scary moments, although after waiting so long to see it I have to say that I was sadly just a bit disappointing.
