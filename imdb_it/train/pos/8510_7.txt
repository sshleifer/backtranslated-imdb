This was the eighth and final film of Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from the cinema and died the following year. It is still a competent thriller, the car continues without him perfectly, but ?? something was missing: Dix! The stories of the Whistler series have always been interesting, sometimes brilliant, the scripts often noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't just Whistler himself who hung it on the screen, he also did Dix. <br /> <br /> Young a couple coming out for a whole week has the impulse to marry in the pouring rain, but is hampered when the potential bride disappears before being married before she gets mad. Is the potential spouse put off, even when his private friend has been hired to find her suddenly thrown by him and Lams, or is love blind? Who twists who the question is. Michael Duane in his second to last film is OK if a bit of a wimp, the good times of Lenore Aubert came the next movie in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was as wonderful as ever on loan from the Boston Blackie. Even the only exit in which Whistler himself got wet crumpled in the rain, unless it was sprayed with sea foam in Voice. <br /> <br /> Much success in this last hour, it's worth watching and again as usual for fans of the genre like me. Whistler's radio series, which began in 1942, continued until 1955, recording nearly 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which are available on mp3 and based on what I've listened to so far and which is worth listening to almost everyone.
