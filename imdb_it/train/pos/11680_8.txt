OK Clara Bow, a 1927 silent film, is a spin-off by Rain, with Bow playing the half-wild Hawaiian daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the English assistant engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attention, but both women get a big surprise when his wife (Patricia Dupont) arrives. The predator wife is ready for divorce until she finds out she could be on the verge of a fortune. Bow quickly settles his hash. <br /> <br /> Bow has personality to spend and has some fantastic scenes: his naked opening bathroom, his hula in a grass skirt and the rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: the list of IMDb credits is incorrect. The film credits (from the DVD I have) list Patricia Dupont as interpretant Mrs. Haldane --- not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb.
