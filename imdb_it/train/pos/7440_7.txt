I just saw the movie, and the scary thing was that the people who talked during the movie sounded just like the actors. The film had its moments, but also late and was quite sick. Everything had to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of people in the movie, think to yourself "People like this are all around us" All attempts to gain public understanding are dashed as the actors do one stupid after another. On the plus side, there are some fantastic (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for a video, but it was a good laugh. ATTENTION- Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not a pretty sight!)
