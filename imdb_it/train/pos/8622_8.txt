I cannot agree with the comment above - there are many interesting and truly amazing film images in this, it has an unusual structure and moves well towards a frightening climatic sequence that is remarkable for its effective use of silence. Moreover, he explores the strange impulse of suicide very bluntly, without punching in what he shows, but without dwelling and over-rationalizing the subject. has a hint of documentary about it, but also horror and auteur cinema, and deserves a place among the canons of "different" horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of which precedes and could very well be an unacknowledged influence on). It's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema.
