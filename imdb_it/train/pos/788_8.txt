Ok - I admit I think Kenny Doughty is wonderful in this film - but beyond his good looks, the film is transported by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, we are presented with the three main women of the film. A manageress: very worried about her image and never married. A policeman - with a child and a former villain to keep going. The third - a doctor hungry for power and state with a desire for recognition and three ex. <br /> <br /> I am almost the "first wives club", and in fact there is a lot of verbal remarks from the former involved and some "left the credit card behavior". Character set - the film continues. <br /> <br /> The character of McDowell, the principal, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, who replaces the usual player (Doughty) attracts his attention. What will your two friends say about the damage that comes from it? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A handkerchief or two recommended if you are the watery type - the edifying end, but perhaps not what you would expect. All in all a great film that stands out among the current action choices, special effects and horror schlock.
