"Panic" is a captivating and blurred genre film about a peaceful and conflicted middle-aged hitman, the reconciliation of infatuation with a young uninhibited hairstylist, his love for his wife and child, his duty to his employer work / father with his identity. Although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending, it is a superb production in almost all aspects. The clarity and sincerity of the characters in such an unlikely story can fascinate and annoy the public.
