These days we refer to the term "superstar" too lightly, but here is a guy who really deserves. <br /> <br /> I was glued to the set for the entire show. The selection of songs was perfect: it contained only the songs that I really wanted to hear and I cut out documentary films during the weaker new songs. I loved the fact that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength, you don't need a circus to have fun). Even the crowd shots were fantastic. How many performers can influence the original Beatles fans (now in their 50s and beyond), making sure that the kids jump to the first lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and influence everyone in the middle? <br /> <br /> As I watched, I also realized that, in the wake of the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney instantly became an afterthought. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their latest relationships were, it must be hard to lose someone you changed the world with), but he also lost his wife Linda and never really perceived the recognition he received from the murder of Lennon. I agree that Lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was a forgotten fellow in the future. I was very happy to have found love in Heather again. <br /> <br /> As for those who complain about audio / video quality, I had no complaints whatsoever; both were clear on my set. I think these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> My only regret was not buying a ticket for this show when I had the chance. Thanks to this video I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. Now I have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And we hope another fool will not change this, because McCartney's catalog is pretty good.
