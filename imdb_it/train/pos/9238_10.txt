Although others have commented that this video is only a modified version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you watch the original shows you will find that the dialogue of this video edition has been modified. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines have been added. I would say that if you want to see the show in its original version, watch the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes offered on DVD now. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes of Galactica 1980 than the same broadcasts. Overall, I consider this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave to producers.
