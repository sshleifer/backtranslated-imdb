Typical comedy of the typical 90s comedy, similar to our modern "My family". Since Thatcher lives up to most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for all she can. "Bloody Thatcher" could be shared with most of us. David, the typical teenager, who cuts brains with bread knives, Jenny, the moody girl, interested only in boys and other boys. Bill and Ben work as hard as possible to keep their struggling family afloat in the economic climate of the early 1990s. Although the first two series have not had the success of the latter, the 3 series on is the point where everything starts with more laughter than I want to count. overall this show did not achieve the best viewing times and should have lasted a little longer. clearly they could not go on after the death of Gary Olsen, but I think they should get rid of "catherine Tate" "the Little Britain office" and bring back the classics!
