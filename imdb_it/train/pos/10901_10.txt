This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only had he survived one of the most painful diseases, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is a life after death and never give up reaching people and spreading his love. Watching the minutes of his long struggle for life was heartbreaking. Listening to his intelligent observations and seeing his lovely gestures was moving. And seeing him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this little giant. Please, if you ever get the chance to see this movie, consider your luck meeting Jonny Kennedy.
