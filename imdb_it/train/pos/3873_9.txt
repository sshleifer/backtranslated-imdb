This film is light, fun and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely superb, and the colors convincingly recall Vermeer's paintings. <br /> <br /> This sentimental comedy is at its best, above US and French standards, and probably better than the English one. <br /> <br /> Each character is moving and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is splendid, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is exceptional in his strange role and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> I could go on for hours before finding any negative comments on this movie, so give it a chance, and add your review.
