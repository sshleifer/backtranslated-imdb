Mario is invited to the castle of Princess Peach for the cake. When Mario arrives, he discovers that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore everything he wants. He can simply wander around, climb trees trying to find 1-Ups, find secrets in the levels and more. You can spend four hours in a level. No time limit. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stadiums, and there are stellar doors, which need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you enter these star doors, you must cross a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the level. To get to certain worlds, you need a certain number of stars to enter. You enter the world by passing through a painting. There is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, I don't see how anyone can not appreciate this game. It's great. This launch title is the game that assured the players that the N64 would have a good life. Every game in 3D format we know has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It is difficult to find used, because nobody sells this child for 5 dollars at the pawn shop. A perfect 10.
