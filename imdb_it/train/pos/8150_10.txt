Mine, Kasi Lemmings is definitely an honest-looking woman. This film is a lost jewel, a satirical "mockumentary" from the early 1980s of the Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer had just started to vanish on that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark on their picaresque journey of aspiring riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, in the end, they end their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best films nobody has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you love or hate, much like "Company Man" in this sense. I consider this film as the 1000 islands of the state of New York: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep for yourself.
