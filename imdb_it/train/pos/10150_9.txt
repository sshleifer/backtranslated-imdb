Sure, this movie is gooey and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's fun, and that's what I watch movies for. Natasha Henstridge is amazing to be entertained, even with short hair. His smile is radiant and his beauty cannot be masked. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love it. They both really seemed to like each other in this movie. I don't understand the comments that there was no chemical interaction between them. I imagine we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even though d'Abo's British accent had crept into his alleged Bronx speech. Actually, I didn't notice until I read these comments, but I returned to the DVD and now his dialogue sounds more English than American to me, but she was ideal for her role with that only exception. <br /> <br /> It is a story of two nice people who marry other significant people, but who find their soul mate in each other. It could be an unlikely story, but who says films should sound like documentaries? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are projected every hour on the tube. This is why we observe them, to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life for a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who easily tears himself. Don't get me wrong though, it must be a sentimental scene, and this movie had many. <br /> <br /> I give him 9/10 just because I'm saving my 10/10 for that still unnoticed a super magnificent film that I know will come one day. If you see it advertised as coming to the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or anything else, make a note to watch it. I think you'll like it.
