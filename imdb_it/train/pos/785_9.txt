Being of Irish origins, I loved this film, not only was the boy nice and likeable, he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he was in love with, she was pretty. They were such a lovely couple. The ending was so sad. I love this movie! Even if it is a little dirty, remember an English or Irish version of Prime. If you enjoyed this movie, you should watch first. The same story about a young boy falls in love with older women, older women fall in love with a young man. Many roads cross, in the end, the best decision is made or the activity is completed. I have nothing else to say, without ruining the whole film, even though I thought French was ugly, less attractive to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I'd recommend "Circle of Friends", that movie is so beautiful. Quick quote, you may not get it unless you look at it "Well, this is my ruined dinner." LOL
