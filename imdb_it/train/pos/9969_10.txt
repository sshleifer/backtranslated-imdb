Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I want to say that nothing is up to the greatest Christmas film of all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The film is so beautiful and has so many messages, I cried as I watched it. Seriously, this is one of those movies that you have to watch 10 times. When we see that Pitch is told he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep pain, and then we wonder ... what's so bad about this ice cream? Are you suggesting that we humans treat ice cream as good when all it does is hurt us? He thinks the movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This film has the best rendition of Santa ever. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him imprison children and spy on children's dreams, and we wonder; is Santa Claus that we really believe so well? Furthermore, this Saint actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You need to look at this cinematic masterpiece yourself. We should simply stop making films and broadcast only this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this film gets a 500/10. Anyone who says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.
