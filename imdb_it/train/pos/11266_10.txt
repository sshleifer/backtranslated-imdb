I recently saw this, but when it started I had no idea what the concept was, what subject it was ... well - I had no idea what it was. It was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ... Well, it was BOTH. <br /> <br /> It started a little slow, but I think it's because I had absolutely no idea what kind of program I was watching. But he quickly sucked me. The episode I saw saw Robert Wuhl discuss facts and fiction in history. Mainly like us (Americans) we learn the story that is not really true - and how we learned to understand what we did. He did it in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested. I actually learned a few things and this is a real indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it picked up as a series for HBO. I think it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics, especially if they are "taught" in the same type as this episode.
