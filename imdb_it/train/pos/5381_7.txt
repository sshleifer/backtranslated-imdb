For a low budget movie this was really good. I put it well above your average action movie. Sean and Corinne participated in this film, and they didn't look shy at the camera. Pay attention to the cameos of Jeanne and Jared. I didn't think the producers would have ever considered it, but the runners-up deserve a lot. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to getting more involved with Sean and Corinne in the film entertainment industry. The character of Sean seemed very genuine, and the character of sexy Corinne was rather hard and punctual. It is well connected to action sequences and performed with confidence. It was a great idea to launch Billy Zane as a clever and clever villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. The action sequences were not vulgar and seemed to be connected during the film. Of course, there were flaws, but this occurred with the territory. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering they are newcomers to the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast have the chance to join their co-stars in entertainment success. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: *** / ****
