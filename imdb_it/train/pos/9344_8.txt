I must admit that this film moved me to the point of bursting into tears. However, I always think about things twice, and instead of writing a eulogy that defines the flawless and flawless film, I prefer to take the risk of taking a closer look. <br /> <br /> First is the first: the film has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts and continues like a slow-paced film that doesn't try to blow the real scenes of September 11th. Congratulations for this stroke of genius, because, unlike Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER, this film fortunately does not focus on the attack itself but on the relapse which, similar to the collapse of a nuclear explosion, is hardly visible but still dangerous and devastating . The psychological impact, the sheer devastation caused by the September 11 attack and the havoc it has caused on the American people are almost palpable in this film. I think Binder has managed a shrewd observation of the post-9/11 American society and Sandler, in my opinion, has jumped to the sky by an average comedian to a true talent who offers a performance worthy of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> However: In the film BLOOD DIAMOND, the character of Di Caprio says and I quote: "Ah, these Americans, they always want to make their feelings". Now, I don't want to belittle their suffering, but I certainly would like to make a comparison. Since the 9/11 attack, the whole world has been faced with memories, memorials and commemorations of 11 September. Industry and Hollywood writers like Safran Foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works. Now, this enormous amount of cultural products, which concern September 11th, transforms the death of 3,000 people into the greatest tragedy of this young century. The number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and I say this with due respect, make the importance of this atrocious crime a little disproportionate. <br /> <br /> The fact is: People die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people. We have a war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Birma and in many other countries. Every day we forget about the poverty suffered by African peoples and we tend to place ourselves with them to a lesser extent than the American victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives do not have much in common with our Western lives. Africa has neither the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way that America can do. So what I'm saying is this: the reason we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a film or a book about 9/11. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I commiserated with Charlie Fineman, but I wasn't sure if I had the right to feel for him more than for a Hutu who lost all his family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> Do you understand?
