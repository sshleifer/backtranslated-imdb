This was a strong Poirot / Suchet, the television mystery selection. The characters were vivid and well recited. The plot and the main environment - a student hostel - were excellent. Japp was nothing special but for me it didn't distract from the story. A significant point, many Poirot observers do not recognize good acting or good characterization. I also think they are rather harsh in their judgments on some of the mysteries of Poirot. Finally, I read some of Christie's novels - none in the last few years - and I find it annoying that so many viewers are upset by the changes in the novel. Please, viewers, consider what is presented to you on the film, not what you think should be there. That said, the mysteries of Poirot vary in terms of quality, but not as much as reviewers and evaluators would have you believe. With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs which was fabulous in the plot, in the character and in the theme, the longer Poirot films are neither good nor bad. For the record, I have seen the films of Poirot / Suchet longer. Finally, films without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad due to their absence. The presence, however, is either intrusive (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
