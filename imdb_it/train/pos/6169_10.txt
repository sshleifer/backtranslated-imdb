Rohinton Mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is rather slow but there is always something on the screen that fascinates the public. The film perfectly captures a particular moment and place with millimeter precision. All the actors are Indians - few if ever known to the "western" public - but they are a joy to see, especially the child who acts very convincingly. Don't be put off by the title and summary of the plot: this is a movie to watch on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from this.
