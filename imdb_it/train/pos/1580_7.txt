This is not another burning look at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events that occurred in a small street in Berlin and in some of the people involved. This film begins in the present time in New York where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) is mourning the death of her husband and all the family members have gathered by his side. Ruth's daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader), learns slowly that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade) and so travels to Germany and identifies the 90-year-old who tells her about events on Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where the Gestapo would keep all Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse , although it is supposed that having the immunity to be married to the Aryans and for nine days a group of women would have waited outside and shouted for their release. The 80-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) waits for her mother to go out and have no place to go but meets the 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann) who welcomes her. Lena's husband, Fabian (Martin Feifel), is also inside and eventually tries to socialize with the Nazi officers to convince them to do something. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta who is making her first feature in almost 10 years after working on television and while this is clearly not one of her most provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in Europe. This is not one of those Nazi films in which we see the horrible acts of inhumanity for the Jews, even if we witness a severe treatment issued, but instead it is more than a story of a small event that has meant life and death of the people involved. This film is not trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates about the circumstances, but what it simply wants to do is throw light on a small but true event of life that occurred during a historical period. Part of the film's strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine above all by Riemann and the young Lohde and it's always nice to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a key role. This is not a great movie or something that will change your perspective on the Second World War but considering that innocent lives have been put to death because of the events that have happened, I think the only reason is important enough to tell this true story.
