This first film has its flaws - a predictable plot and some too long scenes of dubious relevance - but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. He is also stylistically among the most expressionist of his films; note, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both the title and the plot in the images. <br /> <br /> Its core, however, remains the final correspondence, which is still among the most exciting examples of film boxing. Even if you know the hero has to win, it becomes quite credible that he will lose, and his wife's movement from the corner of the champion to his, which motivates the final pay-off of the plot, is very well intertwined with the progress of the match. Stopwatch inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even if this is a silent film, the images often have a surprisingly auditory aspect to them). The rhythm becomes surprisingly fast and the viewer is sucked into the excitement and brutality of both matches and the sexual jealousy that underlies them. <br /> <br /> The only DVD version I'm familiar with is Laserlight, a public domain company. As with every Hitchcock silence they published, they attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is often sloppy and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have entered most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final game works very well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive film than its current darkness would suggest. It deserves an honorable place both in Hitchcock's canon and in the lean list of boxing films that are worthwhile.
