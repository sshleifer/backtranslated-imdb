Kim Novak is a witch in search of a mortal lover, and James Stewart is his choice. Sparkling comedy of good manners, from the Broadway stage; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and performed by a pound cast. Ernie Kovacs is as wonderful as Redlitch's perpetually disheveled writer. I love this movie, even if few others seem. Kim alone makes him a winner in my book. Has! My film no. 5 of 1958.
