I watched this show as a child and I loved it! I saw it when Toonami arrived YEARS ago .... Sheesh, it sounds so old! I must have been 13 or 14 when he arrived ... But anyway, he had a fantastic plot, and I'm one of those wandering girls who watched (and LOVED) Sailormoon, and I loved it. The animation wasn't the best ... In some parts it was pretty funny, actually, and dubbing was EXTREMELY lame at first, but it was all a good watch, and I found myself sucking it day after day. <br /> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, and one of all time one of my favorites. Go Ryo !!!!
