I have just finished watching this film and can honestly say that it is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall assessment as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only does Guy put together a cast of ab list (ish) and transforms them into such glorious characters, he gave us a fantastic movie a different storyline with much left to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Too many people want films with a plot that can be understood and passed on to them on a plate ... yet these are the films that become poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This film is special. Take it now!
