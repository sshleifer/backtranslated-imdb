Sometimes the conversation turns into "favorite movies". I will mention Titanic and at least a couple of people will chuckle. I don't pay them because I know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that movie. And now I'm too embarrassed to admit it. <br /> <br /> I just saw Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting simply to enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the film has not lost its power in these five years. I cried again ... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997, when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would even become the most popular film of all time. A film that bursts into the public consciousness like no other film you can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people will not even admit that they enjoyed it. Folks, let's take something straight - you don't look nice when you beat this movie. You look like a cynic out of control. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and this has some flaws. Some of the dialogues fall, and part of the plot that surrounds the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracted as to ruin the film. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him anything but a nice guy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The film was really his, and he held it together beautifully. James Cameron was able to recreate what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely credible Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrible, just like them that night. How anyone can say that the effects were bad is beyond me. I was completely transfixed. <br /> <br /> This film is one memorable scene after another. Port of leaving Titanic in Southampton. Rose and Jack in the bow, "fly". "Iceberg, right in front!" The vines hung incredibly from the ocean. The screams of the condemned after she went down. And that ending that brought to tears even the most surly man in the theater. <br /> <br /> Music, which was also a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. Too bad that the pop version of Celine Dion has had to destroy this good bit of music for so many. I confess, I'm a fan of Titanic. As such, I appreciated the opportunity to see the ship as we have never seen it, in all its beauty. Perhaps watching him sink hit me more than a few because I had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt that many of those I saw crying were Titanic enthusiasts. I congratulate Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that has never diminished the tragedy. The film was made with so much humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: open your hearts to the Titanic and you won't be disappointed.
