this was the most expensive film when it was produced. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were both afflicted by his poor assessment --- for good reason. was and remains much ahead of its time. apart from the apparently poor direction, probably the editing, at the beginning, the work starts at a staggering conclusion. <br /> <br /> if his role as "Boss" by Sir Ralph Richardson, or better yet, that of his wife, Sir Cedric's, as an opponent of space travel, the central role of John Cabal by Raymond Massey - all offer mind-boggling performance. <br /> <br /> the scene with Mr. The unparalleled scenery of Korda, of the little girl-child, running towards an absolutely "never matched" scene, commenting "Life continues to become more beautiful and more beautiful"? which quickly brings tears to any parent / grandfather. this is not a film for young people - except for "experts" and rather for those who have seen "the horror" that is opposed. <br /> sure, the "bogus parachuting", it seems a bit like using a 'magnetic cannon', now called a 'mass driver' can be considered ridiculous, against rockets --- giving Sir Korda a pause - Mr. Wells made that choice. and at +/- $ 8 million, this film went far beyond the "excessive budget" --- so it focused on what it could handle. <br /> <br /> the true power of this cinema Greatest rests in 'John The final statement of Cabal's human destiny --- his friend "Passworthy" doubts the wisdom of space-faring, saying: "We are so small animals ". The appropriate answer of John Cabal is, (paraphrased) "Yes, little animals, and if this is all we are, we must live and die as such". they are under a large astronomical telescope. he sweeps his hand over the night sky. 'And yet we could have the whole universe, or nothing .'--- then the final chorus breaks off ---' What will it be? '--- this is not' Star Wars', 'Blade Runner' --- anything you can consider 'Big' --- this is the True Thing. <br /> <br /> I remember all of Steven Hawking's most recent speech, on his last 'Medal of Honor' --- 'Humanity must leave Earth, or die .'--- the core of this work --- I love "standard entertainment" --- yet this "relic", for the wise spectator, offers much more. "What will it be?" to be in the right 'mood' --- whatever it requires --- this will take your breath away --- I 'heal' --- on the whole, for humanity? the most significant of the cinema. <br /> <br /> from the time of publication, I notice that many have commented on the poor "average-quality" examples of "survivors". in the 1980s I developed a "proprietary coloring" process that required a "clean" original. this led me to Michael Korda, who sadly noticed that everyone was gone --- so we have to savor what's left - "sad but true?"
