Ever since I can remember and I'm only 18, my mother and I have been and continue watching older films because I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey don't get me wrong I like movies today I'm not as much as I love movies from the 40s and 50s, however, now I have to say that from the moment I started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the TV, obviously my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson, but I loved the The way Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... did not behave like children in the slightest, but there is a good reason for this, having to hide and run most of your life, to see the terrible things that the children saw in those days destroyed their innocence, so people say "oooo I hated how children acted ... blah blah blah" he read between the lines and knew he had seen things that the children didn't have to see. <br / > <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an incredible job !!! Now I know that many people are angry about having done the Oscar and Bogie didn't do it, but they both did an incredible job so I think it could have gone either way. But the performance of Lukas was so incredible that at the end of the film I reduced to tears. I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone !! :-D
