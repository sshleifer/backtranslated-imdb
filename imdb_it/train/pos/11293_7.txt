William Wyler would direct this adaptation of the Broadway comedy with Moss Hart's music / recruiting poster-vivant, but his military commitments came to an end and he went to a very unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "director of women" has a sure touch on the numerous documentary sequences of the military aeronautics, and invests it with a more reckless humanity of the generally allowed genus, particularly in time of war. Of course, the magician (and quite white, apart from an unpaid Chinese-American recruitment) of novices is more beautiful and healthier than in real life, and the words about home and mother and wife and child become quite thick, but it is efficient and undeniable propaganda. Also notable for the cast of men all military, many of which have not re-emerged for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as sister of Andrews), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also for a very initial look at Judy Holliday, who does not show up for an hour and a half in the photo, but has some nice sequences like the wife of Brooklyn, worried and sick of O'Brien. Too bad his rights are in a tangle and the only press that everyone knows is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (with considerable success), the rights returned to the army, and if there is a good 35mm mark, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It is dishonest and trivial in the points, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terror of war vividly, and deserves to be seen more widely.
