A sweet and totally fascinating film, Shall We Dansu? it made me laugh and cry At the first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not terribly attractive: a tired salaried, apparently devoted to his family, but all too easily fascinated by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But at the end of the film, I was in love with him, she, his wife and daughter, all the dance instructors and dance students. This simple story of transformation and renewal is a little gem that I'd like to see again.
