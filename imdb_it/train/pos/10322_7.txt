The problem is that the film entered into the heart of the concept created by the 1960s that comic books could only be made as "field" (ie the Batman show of the 1960s) for TV and film. So you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), A useless non-romantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable for women in meat loaves, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a pawl (a scene that guaranteed nightmares for several nights) the clandestine end ends with the second-degree villain enclosed in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar status. And when they're not making Sousa's score boom, the tiny "funny" music takes away much of the drama. <br /> <br /> Even so, this movie is ... okay. It's fun, and when it's serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, as has been said before: he is very muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who should be a thin, pale boy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf. <br /> <br /> The sequences of Green Death, for example, are extraordinarily macabre and not something I would recommend to children but they are very close to the sensation of meatloaf. When the writers and the producers are right, they do it well - I'll give them to them. <br /> <br /> But if the producers had made Doc with the loving precautions and scripting of, say, before Reeves's two Superman films, think about what we might have had then. I think the problem is schizophrenic in the film. There is a strong sense of trying to pay homage to the 1930s, but they are also trying to yield to the attitude of the "heroes who must be camped" that Batman has created. One gets the impression that there was a first sober, pulp-like draft and then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's make it fun - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc lives, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch is not paying homage to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is really demented. So when the series arrives on TV (presumably mid-season in '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will live once more.
