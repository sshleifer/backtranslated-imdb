Remember the first days of Pay Per View? I know, and I can almost remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a child we always wanted to rent playboys, but that meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking them to rent it. And then you have the courage to do it and your watching four hours of soft core without angular crap. Well, the reason I say this is because this film was also on ppv. And I remember almost every scene that was in the addition. In the last few years I have been doing a kick to get all the great movies I saw as a child and this was one of them. It's one that when it's hard to turn off. All the stars tried to make the perfect shot, but nothing is good. There are a lot of fake bank capers that are good and this must fall into that category. He has enough action and laughs to support him. check it if you dare!
