I didn't like it at first, even though I did. They did not include the third generation Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some actors were too different from what I had imagined. <br /> <br /> I later realized that, if the film was more faithful to the book, it would have been like five hours, and it would be a bit boring. Now I like it a lot, because my favorite characters are there as I portrayed them. Clara really looks like a live angel, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the film was fantastic, faithful and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined it that way, just not grieving the whole thing. Esteban is enough to find. I never liked his character, and even though I was interested in him, I really hated him, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting, and it also has a real story. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially considering that it was a gringo film based on a Latin American book. It's amazing how many famous stars there are, don't you think so?
