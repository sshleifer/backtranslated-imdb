What do you get if you go through The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've seen The Matrix by now. The creators of The Matrix say it is "inspired by souls". Just by looking at the trailer for this classic, you can see where they took the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit set in 1980s Japan, and really shows. The costumes, music and words (in the recent English version of AD Vision) are all as if they were raised directly from the era. I think it was also done at that time, but due to some points in the plot, it doesn't come out with the movie! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed from my reference to The Matrix, the world is not real. It's not really the 80s. In fact, it's more like 2480. After a nuclear war, the Earth ecosystem (or "Biosphere Prime") was destroyed. The survivors are forced to flee into space, where the conflict has continued. Once the planets (or "Biospheres") were all abandoned, people began to live in Megazone - cities inside spaceships, where, through techniques of hypnotism and illusion of Truman Show, they were forced to believe that we are back on earth, in the most peaceful moment of recent memory ... The 80s. When the young Shogo gets a mysterious, advanced-looking motorcycle, he takes him to discover more than he should know ... The Garland (a motorcycle that becomes a mech), a weapon of 2400, helps Shogo in his escape from military pursuit . As we discover more and more about the MegaZone, the war is approaching at home and, due to conflicts between the military and computers, the war also reaches the MegaZone ... I apologize if those points are seen as spoilers, but the plot is basically outlined this way on the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions are very high in this film, more than the Matrix. You really believe that the war is going on, and Shogo really becomes quite marked by what he is discovering. What begins as a uber-happy 80s cool film becomes a tragic story of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cut-outs we saw in bullet-time in The Matrix. There is indeed a sense of suffering that people can go through after being involved in such a conspiracy and in a war. He might just suffocate you towards the end ... I know he did me. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite impressive for his day and the quality of the images on the ADVision DVD is incredible for his age. The artistic style is beautiful and recalls traditional, very cultural souls. Get ready for a lot of violence and blood, there's also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The ending can be seen as a "there can be no ending", similar to the Matrix, or, presumably, can be followed by the sequel, which I have not yet had the pleasure of watching. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is one of the best anime I've seen, in fact, one of the best movies I've seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest spirits of all time. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend the ADVision DVD, since their interpretation of the English language is incredible, and makes the film justice, and can be purchased with an artbox to hold the two sequels when they are released, which will have the same vocal cast. <br /> <br /> All in all, MegaZone 23 is an incredible film, and deserves to be kept a lot, and should be an essential element in the collection of all anime fans. Hell, my mother also enjoyed it.
