This film makes no specious efforts to hide its true genre - a B campy movie. The definition of campy will start telling you at the beginning. It should also give the adjective meaning of the cheese. But the two join in this movie in ways that make you go "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" and then laugh? For example, there is a scene in "16th century Japan", which shows a pair of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple, there are many tourists who look in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I couldn't stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to my God, but that's what makes it fun. You will see some decent actors and then you will find the others really terrible. I have to digress a little, though, because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in different comedies and she's fantastic. However, his flight time in the film was rather short. I also saw Bryan Yamasaki in different performances on the islands during my visits and he is also better at the theater than in this film. Anyway, it's a funny movie, if you have nothing to do on a weekday evening.
