`The United States of Kiss My Ass' <br /> House of Games is the directorial debut of playwright David Mamet and is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as the best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the player who prompted one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so he leaves the safety and comfort of his life a little ordinary behind him and travels to the "center" to visit the place of low life, the House of Games. <br /> <br /> The player Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be a bit sharp and elusive. He offers the Crouse character an agreement, if he is willing to sit down with him at a game, a game with pocket money, he will cancel the patients' debts. The card game follows and soon the psychiatrist and the player see each other in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and begin a fascinating relationship. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential vision for any film lover is the constant assumption of who has control, is the psychiatrist or con man or is the well-known big bluff man David Mamet. <Br /> <br /> In House of Games the direction is boring and mostly flat and uninteresting, however in every David Mamet film it is the story that is central to the whole process, not the direction. In House of Games this shines in part thanks to the superb performances of the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as in the case of much of Mamet's work, it is dialogue, which grips you and slowly drags you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlefields and war of words. All bluff and double the bluffs, which resembles a natural order of poker games. This is a recurring theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right times to create large amounts of tension. House of Games can also be seen as a "class-war" division. With Lindsay Crouse we have a well-educated middle-class and wealthy psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the exact opposite, the working class of America makes a living from "honest" crime. <br /> <br /> The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the film's final is definitely something for everyone to see and watch, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> An extremely enjoyable cinematic experience that deserves repeated views. 9/10
