In my mind, this remains one of the best representations of Superman on TV, as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comic book period. <br /> <br /> This series paid tribute to both the Superman films of the 70s / 80s and the Superman comic book series "reboots" from 1986 onwards ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2 "," Action Comics "," Adventures of Superman ", etc.). The initial score and titles were moving, based on the John Williams score of the films, updated for a series of Saturday morning actions. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to the comics reboot (author of "Adventures of Superman") was a perfect choice to get involved in this animated series. Overall, the series had a more mature appearance while still being very child-friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as credible, strong and iconic. His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac incarnation / CEO. The Daily Planet characters Lois, Jimmy and Perry have been well interpreted. One of my favorite appearances was of Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her native Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her design and that of her mother Hippolyte were in line with the Wonder Woman comic book series of the same era, and it seemed that an equally well-made animated series could have been developed for her if she had been handled the same way. > <br /> The only thing that is hard to believe is that this was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
