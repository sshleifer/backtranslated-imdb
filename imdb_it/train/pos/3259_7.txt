This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty and watchable. It is run in an old-fashioned way and works perfectly. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who fails to overcome her husband's death. He has a sexy maturity. But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neal like Philip, because he is, at best, anonymous. It might be adequate in the role, but it's not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I have the feeling that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, have not been written with enough thought. We don't know anything else about them because the storyline becomes dense a few minutes after their appearance, and the writers don't tell us much more than what happens. But that problem was saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh sweetness like a daisy to cheer him up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming to melt the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And so it happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is light and easy and if you like it that way, why not try it. <br /> <br />
