"Life hits us in the face ........ we must try to remain beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut film by one of the best Belgian artists (sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited film and happy --- happy joy for Flemish cinema --- really is worth looking at and a promising job! It takes us into the lives of 8 main characters who live through a Friday and a night. The title says a lot about how we spend time with them: we float like they do on the Friday night party they meet. <br /> <br /> The rhythmic style is very "carefree". Superb use of music. Sometimes it takes over the images and then you feel the power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is an electrifying experience for the visual experience of the way it is filmed. He really cares about it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party ..... so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot Barman for making this bold film in these, for some years now, difficult times of Flemish cinema. You made my day!
