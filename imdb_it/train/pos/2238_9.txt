Since this film is completely in Swiss dialect, it is probably difficult for most German speakers to really follow this film. I'm not Swiss, but I worked there for a few years, so I had the chance to understand this great parody of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies like this (for example Scary Movie, a lot of scifi spoofs etc.) but this is the best of this type, I've seen it so far. I give a 9 of 10. The only reason I can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details that could have been done better and because they didn't provide subtitles in any language on the DVD, so there's almost no non-Swiss possibility to understand.
