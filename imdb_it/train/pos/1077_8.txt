This is as comical as it once was and comparing it with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET? lost. <br /> <br /> I was 15 when I saw it for the first time and even at that tender age, there was a lot I could laugh about. Now, of course, I'm familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see a lot of things that I lost when I was young. <br /> <br /> The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... they interacted perfectly, but the heart of the film lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream. It is never as easy and free of invisible complications as you imagine. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a classic comedy that is still above attempts to do it again.
