John Carpenter's Halloween is frankly a masterpiece of horror. It tells the immortal story of the escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to chase and kill a group of babysitters. <br /> <br /> This was the first and without doubt the best of the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows a great restraint in the rhythm of the story very slowly and in the construction of nice characters; unusual for a horror photo. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and blood, yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. Take this! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a defining point in the career of the late great Donald Pleasance. A true classic.
