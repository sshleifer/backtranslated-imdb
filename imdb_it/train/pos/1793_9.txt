I saw this movie Sunday afternoon. I really enjoyed this movie. I loved it all, from the mawkish moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) cries because of her poor decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she's really in love. I loved these moments because they were so real. At first I was seriously scared because I hoped he wouldn't end up like Bobby, who was a great cast but a badly written film with no real meat. But during the middle of the film I felt completely different. You will laugh and cry but in the end you will want to see one more evening. Trust me when I say GO SEE IT!
