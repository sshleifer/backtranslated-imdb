I rarely see a film that I am totally absorbed in; this was one of them. He had a good acting, dialogue, plot and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed loudly many times, especially the scene that dealt with the kitchen raid. The slapstick comedy performed by the hired hand was my master, but I admit to being an idiot for slapstick. The story was about a group of people in their thirties returning to a summer camp they had attended 20 years earlier. It was a week of leaving the campsite, as the place would be permanently closed at the end of the season. As adults the camp looked different, and they felt differently about it and each other. I recommend this funny and moving film to everyone. <br /> <br />
