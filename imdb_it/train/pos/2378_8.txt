This film is much better than the refugee version, mainly its war of the worlds. The tripods look pretty good, but their walk and their deaths could have been better. The action scenes were really fantastic. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! oh my god stop walking please or i'll kill myself. The thunder scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed a group of tripods. Good movie, I recommend it to anyone who has read the book. The music is fantastic and the directors have a nice look. <br /> professionals. Good soundtrack 99% to the book Cool violence The tripods and the handling machines are fantastic to look at <br /> <br /> against. a bit tacky acting looking at London
