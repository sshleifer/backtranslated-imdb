A thief in the night must be the best of all end-of-the-night thrillers. I have no idea what people complain about when people complain that these films scared them into accepting God. They just needed to find an excuse and blame A thief in the night. Do not listen! These films do not only tell one of the many possibilities of tribulation, but they are also fun to look at in their simplicity. They are actually low budget and this is a bit obvious, but not entirely obvious at first sight. I had no idea why I thought that many films like these products in the 70s included always low budgets. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of the young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for what happens to her, until her husband and almost all her friends will not disappear in the prophetic rapture that everyone has warned her about . At the beginning, the film is not based on her until the kidnapping takes place. What leads to show that all others around her are becoming Christians and believers in Christ, which is usually what happens to many people. Anyone around them, who once knew and loved, would disappear forever, and the one who stayed behind is the one who blames everyone except themselves. No one can ever blame himself because he is always right. <br /> <br /> Just like these whiners complaining about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I am thirteen years old and you don't see me complaining, especially because I was exactly like Patty before accepting Christ in my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything thrown into a Christian movie instead of a stereo typical of all the others they are wrong films, then you will enjoy A thief in the night. Don't knock before trying it. Something new is always good. Trust your instincts.
