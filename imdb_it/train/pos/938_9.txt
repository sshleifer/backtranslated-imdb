Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without a British accent, he more than made up for it with his exaggerated and exaggerated interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Particularly effective is when confronted with Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the film. As Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight casts a luminous cloak over him; all you can see is its silhouette. Increased by the voice of Scott, a powerful growl, the effect is galvanizing ... just like the first scene by Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The horror", really! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, the same thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott shows such cheerful ferocity throughout the film, it turns out to be contagious. To put it another way, the "first" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after", although in reality it shouldn't be. That's what you might call the "Doctor Smith" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when he played that role and numerous other supports (both on screen and on screen). <br /> <br /> In fact, I myself do not consider Scott's sly anger a responsibility. But other "Christmas Carol" purists might. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
