I came across this (Act I) out of pure luck and this was over a decade ago. This was not even what the cover label on the tape said. He surprised me. He intimidated me. It shocked me. In the end I forgot and almost a decade later, I happened to think about it again. Then he went to buy both papers. They were even better than I had at the beginning. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while the tank police continue to go on and on to be at war with crime, guaranteeing heavy tanks and artillery, it would seem like they were actually going through a difficult time with criminals. This is never shown or is simply a lie as it seems that they are easily taking most of the time. If that bit of being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly wasn't shown as such. <br /> <br /> I don't think the original Japanese version could have been anywhere like the Americanized version of this. But as far as history is concerned, there have certainly been correct explanations lost in the translation, but they can be excused.
