I saw the movie "On Thin Ice" on television in India .. I must say that the film was really well done, and it really sent a shiver down my spine ... the basic story makes me think about what makes it certain addicts decide to go ahead where others are still dependent ... <br /> <br /> however, I heard that Diane Keaton was at her best ... the scene where she has cravings, and starts rummaging around her house for the cocaine ... it was the best ... the two guys are good, and Lynda Boyd also proved to be a good actress .... The script is well done as well as the cinematography and the direction .. and the casting <br /> <br /> A must watch movie ..... for everyone
