I heard about this film for the first time after buying the 1976 movie "Snuff". I was told that the devil's experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested to know that Charlie Sheen had gone out trying to ban this movie or the second one, so my interest was at its best. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. Only 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways such as beating her, twirling her repeatedly in a circle and then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to the high-pitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a hammer, burning and putting maggots on burns, throwing guts, eventually pushing a sharp needle through his eyes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that a lot of this film was fake, like the scenes they fly. But then, some of these have been well made to frame you. The scenes in which the woman is turned in circles made me dizzy to look at him. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to a high-pitched noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't shoot when I looked at it, but I just thought "Damn, it looks good enough for such a cheap movie". I liked the movie but I don't know if I can really recommend it unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
