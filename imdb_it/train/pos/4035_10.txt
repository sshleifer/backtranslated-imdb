In a word ... incredible. <br /> <br /> At first I wasn't too keen on watching Pinjar as I thought this would be another film that complained about the partition and would show bias towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a poignant, emotional and intelligent film without visible defects. I was persecuted by it after seeing it. It stayed in my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion - everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece that can rarely be seen in Bollywood today. It has no prejudices and prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, bad Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and disturbing. Everything in the film was fantastic ... and the acting took my breath away. All were perfectly expressed. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful film ... look no further. This film offers everything. I recommend it with all my heart. INCREDIBLE can not describe how excellent it is.
