Zentropa is the most original film I've seen in years. If you like the unique thrillers that are influenced by the film noir, then this is the right cure for all those Hollywood blockbusters that are blocking the cinema these days. Von Trier's followers like Breaking the Waves have gained more support, but this is really his best job. It is flashy without distraction and offers the perfect combination of suspense and black humor. Too bad he decided that portable video cameras were the wave of the future. It is difficult to say who took him away from the style he exhibited here, but it is the loss of all that instead went in his direction strongly theoretical dogma.
