This is the first film I saw of John Singleton and he is a pretty good director. The film begins with a group of incoming freshmen and shows what happens to many of them. Omar Epps plays a star with a partial scholarship and has difficulty keeping up with his work. He is a friend of Ice Cube and beings who frequent Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped and becomes friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and she is not sure which way to go. Michael Rapaport is an Idaho child who falls into a group of neo-Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who tries to help them. It's a great film and it's a shame that the studio had to make several cuts to the film.
