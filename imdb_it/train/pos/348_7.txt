These slasher photos exceed sales by date, but this is fun. <br /> <br /> The same Valentine's Day cards are witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> The film has a fishing of a line ... "It is not an angel ...." when in reality IS Angel !!! Watching Buffy's replicas will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The cast is a wild show of young talents, but the story does not give it enough depth. Denise Richards in the DVD extras seemed to think that the girls on the set came together and this would give the feeling of being empathetic with their characters. Sorry but NO! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, managing to show very little cold and relying on your implicit threat of imagination. Much can also be said about the similar way in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main advantage of directing lies in the "loan" of various others the ideas of the previous slasher movies.The scene of the Psycho shower is bestowed, along with the "masking" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> Murdering someone hiding in a bodybag is still quite original as far as I know !! ! <br /> <br /> Clear vision, not very scary, but some good jumping moments. If it was a choice between The Hole and this, however, choose The Hole. Slasher movies have had their day, and this it's just another slasher, good slasher, but nothing innovative !!!
