This film has rewritten the history of cinema in every way. Nobody cares what anyone thinks of this film, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the film is easily overcome by the many incredible things that the film has done. It is an extremely beautiful film, and I doubt that many of us will see something similar again. I've seen it more than I care to count, and I continue to be paralyzed every time, with a feeling that is difficult to describe. One for the ages.
