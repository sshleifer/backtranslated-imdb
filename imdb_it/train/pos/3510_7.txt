True movie fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the trolls who regard this film as a star and define it as unrealistic. Even if I don't have the background or I don't come from the protagonists' environment, I spent many years working in low-income neighborhoods and in the working class and felt that acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. I don't know what the basis for the comments of others is that the film is "unrealistic". The dialog box is fantastic. <br /> <br /> The low budget production value didn't bother me a bit. I felt that natural lighting improved the character of the film. The focus was entirely on the plot and character development and not on the glitzy Hollywood arrangement or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I completely purchased the character's motivations and reactions. The acting was credible and impressive for the new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then jump. If you like beautiful character-driven dramas, then watch them. <br /> <br /> (Regarding the negative commentators who are "trolls": click on their names and you will see that most have no other reviews or only negative reviews.)
