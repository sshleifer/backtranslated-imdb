GBS wrote its own film adaptation of this Nobel Prize winning work but did not survive to see it produced (he had won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger assembled (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he had noticed the British author Graham Greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Shaw's own script, Greene uses material from the Epilogue stage to create a framing device to merge the two acts of the drama (one in advance and one late in Joan's story) in a unified and more satisfying whole. Where on stage the shift of tone is buffered with an interruption, here it works just as well with a return to the bedroom of KING Charles Balois (where the man Joan has put on the throne dreams of the events that led to his current situation ), and other material from Shaw's Epilogue - the introduction of Warwick's shadow by John Gielgud (the English "king builder"). <br /> <br /> Most of the language is solid GBS, and the performances of the seasoned Shauvians (like Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) to their newcomers (the film established Jean's career Seberg) are top notch. He can do it, knowing only the many villains in the Richard Widmark film, to see him play a fragile and somewhat silly Dauphin, but the performance - strangely superior to that date - is professional, though arguably mixed. <br /> <br /> the symbolism of the headlines and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white shots are all elements that serve Shaw and history. Look forward to quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
