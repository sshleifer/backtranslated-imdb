This was Keaton's first feature film and is actually three short films, set in different eras (stone age, Roman age, modern age) on the eternal triangle of romanticism. The stories are parallel to each other as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which was destined to satirize. The strengths of the jokes and the gags are almost all based on anachronisms, bringing the affairs of today into ancient settings. <br /> <br /> **** PAY ATTENTION - SPOILERS FOLLOW TO PROCESS THE BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Use a turtle as a little dog (stone age); A wristwatch with a solar dial (Roman era); A wagon with a spare wheel (Roman age); Use a helmet like a padlock for tires (Roman age); Early golf with bats and rocks (stone age); Dictate a testament on a rock (stone age); The changing meteorologist (Roman age); Snow chariot racing -Buster with skis and huskies with a spare dog in the wagon boot (Roman age). <br /> <br /> The above are all gags that keep us giggling. There are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster taking out his shaving equipment to match the make-up girl; The fantastic double-jack when a drunken Buster observes his plate to discover a crab that stares at him (in a second he jumped up on the chair and sat up again in the waiter's arms - one of the funniest moments I've ever seen ). And that lion - the manicure - simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of off-color racism when four African American trash bearers abandon their mistress for a game of Roman crap. <br /> <br /> The Kino print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous nitrate deterioration sequences and film damage, most likely at the ends of the rollers. The Metro function is marked with piano and flute and borrows heavily from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Very fun and full of laughter.
