This film has several things going on. It's a story of "feeling good". The characters and the actors are nice, realistic and present excellent performances. The most important thing, I think, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and pull a baseball. Robert Redford was good at launching and rocking in "The Natural", as well as Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In "Major League", Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know they were doing, but many others didn't, and that picture was pure nonsense - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So many previous baseball films, even where the stories could be interesting, had such a lack of baseball skills from leads, they were ridiculous about it: in "The Stratton Story" and " Strategic Air Command ", Jimmy Stewart seemed credible as a professional baseball player, like your overweight, non-athletic, senior uncle in the game of softball for family reunion. Other virile and physically robust stars (for example, Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan in the role of Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey in the role of Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball skill that would put them in the advanced rounds while "choosing" for a Sunday picnic game (even if it was a coed, and even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes of the Quaid high school team he coached, those in which he participates in his rehearsal with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League, are all true . The participants are credible and capable. Moreover, he is a captivating actor who always offers an appropriate and talented characterization (except, to some extent, some of his "exaggerated" scenes and his forced accent, in his portrait of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is definitely on target here, and this film is a "9", as good, or better, as all the others of this genre, except "The Natural".
