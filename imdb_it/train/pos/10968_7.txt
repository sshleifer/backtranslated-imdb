Gray Gardens was compelling and crazy and you couldn't really look away. It was so strange, and funny and sad and sick and ?????? .. really no word can describe. The Gray Gardens move is beyond bizarre. I discovered this film by reading My Uncle John's Great Bathroom Reader from the Institute of Bathroom Reader's, and it was worth hiring and reaching the top of my film to watch the queue. This film is about the most exciting eccentric people that have ever been filmed. One should watch it for their favorite Edie clothes, which I'm sure include curtains. When I get older, I almost want to be like Big Edie, turning my nose to normality and society.
