Writer / director / co-star Adam Jones is at the head of great things. This is the thought I had after seeing his feature film "Cross Eyed". An independent film rarely makes me feel as good as his. Expertly written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" keeps you involved from start to finish. Adam Jones may not yet be a known name, but it will be. If this movie had one or two "Named Actors" it would be a sensation at the Box Office. I think he still has the chance to be seen by a main streaming audience if only a movie distributor takes the time to work on this movie. Regardless of where it ends, if you have the chance to see it you will not be disappointed.
