I was ready to do this episode, as this 'Master' really has no horror film under its belt ... but this is easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The acting was good !! I don't know how he managed to beat him, but we have a real talent in this episode! And while you saw things coming from a mile away from the plot, at least it was fun and could get me to be engaged for the whole 56 minutes, something that was missing up until this point in the series. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the bit at the end, not a turn to say, but just a little fun where it becomes, like always, the hen-headed hubby. <br /> <br /> Really a great effort. As I have already said in other reviews, these are not true masters who do many of these episodes ... but could one day end up becoming masters in the future.
