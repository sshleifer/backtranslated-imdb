It's always sad when "marginal" films like this are overlooked by most filmmakers. "Panic" is an extraordinarily compelling and moving study of a character who feels trapped in the uselessness of his life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This good actor seems to have a special talent for pulling the strings of the heart, no matter how spoiled his characters may be; we may not always tolerate the lifestyle of the protagonists he interprets, but the emotions of fear and confusion that we evoke are often too painfully familiar. The title, "Panico", initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of manifest emotion. At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. However, as this story develops, it becomes increasingly obvious that anger and despair, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence. More than once I was reminded of his performance in "Fargo". another film strongly driven by the characters. Both in "Fargo" and in "Panico" we witness a middle-aged man who somehow seems to have left the synchronous with the rest of his life. He lost his way, and the only seemingly deceiving way back appears to be darkness. He knows he is making bad choices, but despair exceeds self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex connects with Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (mesmorizingly played by Neve Campbell), whom she meets in an office doctor. Thematically, this union is less random, more the work of destiny. Alex finds some comfort in being with Sarah, perhaps because he is a derelict person, like him, someone who has lost his way and is floating aimlessly for the rest of his life, powerless waiting for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> Opting for films like this is a shrewd and convincing way for Neve Campbell to respond to those critics who question his acting skills. Too often are the characters who interpreted what are the weak points, offering Campbell no depth in which to flex his recitative muscles. This performance, however, could open the eyes of many. <br /> <br /> In a perfect film world, not only would there be many other films like "Panic", but they too could reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization, rather than simply the latest, most advanced special effects, then, for you, "Panic" is unmissable. A +.
