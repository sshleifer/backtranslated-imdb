I'd like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did the show die again? I couldn't refer to everything, but sometimes they hit the problems they were facing at home. By the way, did they ever get out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We have to see them live a couple of good times. something they didn't have very often. I would like them to bring the show back. During the day people can really stand up to watch. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They really are what made Good Times Good Times. These are my questions and my comments. Thank you!!
