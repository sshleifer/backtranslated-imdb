For a Danish film, I must say that this is a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> It is in a class of its own, but has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget and plays with famous Danish actors and some newcomers, who play very well. It can be seen by anyone who loves adventures and some "ghost" movies. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid, be thrilled!
