I saw this film on the Hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the solitary Englishman who assumed the personality of the half-breed Gray Owl. The photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film made me do more research on this character that Archie Belaney called simple like Gray Owl. I want to read as much as possible about him. At the time I didn't know that Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I'm not surprised. I like all his films, whether you act as a director. I gave the highest rating. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the WHY movie that he took on this character as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their home. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with this film, if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful story without listening to vulgar language and special effects invented every few minutes.
