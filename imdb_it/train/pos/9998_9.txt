Since the average rating was rather low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "OK", I didn't have much expectations when I rented this movie. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the above, I really enjoyed it. This is a fascinating film. It doesn't need to grow on me, I liked it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as a protagonist, I think somewhat different from his usual character in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not a lot of knockout jokes or something, but there are some pretty hilarious scenes, and overall this is a very fun and very easy to watch movie. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
