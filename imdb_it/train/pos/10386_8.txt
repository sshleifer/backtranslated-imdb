What is wrong with you people, if you have not been swept away by the action car sequences and the hot body of Jessica Simpson, then you are very screwed in the head. Obviously the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think he wanted to be. It was fun and funny, I never saw the show when I was younger, I only saw one episode recently, and when I saw the movie, I felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The places in the movie were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because I wasn't bored and dragged out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and Jessica Simpson is simply sexy, I just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, I had a lot of time watching this and would like to go see it again soon and buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
