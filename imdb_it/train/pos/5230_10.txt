In fact, I really enjoyed this film a lot. Not for the plot, for acting, for jokes, no. I liked it, because it's one of the worst movies ever made. He is so lame, so mean, that he becomes terribly funny. Some jokes are really interesting, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the writer. "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that they can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
