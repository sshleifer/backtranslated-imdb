In the past, if Marion Davies had had his druthers and not only listened to William Randolph Hearst, he would have made more films as Show People and would have been much happier. In fact, when you see her make her first big break in two reel comedies, she would have liked to do it in her career instead of epic as When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see from all the Show People accounts is the real Davies, a talented comedian, superb mimicry and a generous and kind-hearted person. He could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire, enduring her fictional part in her Hollywood celebrity. <br /> <br /> If the Show People plot was set in the legitimate phase you would call it is a story behind the scenes. I imagine that being one of the first films on films can be defined as a film behind the camera story. Marion is eager for young hopes that she comes to Hollywood like so many others, looking for that great opportunity. He wants to do dramas, but his introduction to the cinema is the counterpart of the burlesque comics. He picks up his slice of pie and flint, but learns his trade. And the heart of the young comic actor William Haines also wins. <br /> <br /> He gets his first big break, but it is not for Haines either and Marion manages to make a legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli, playing Andre Telfair, a fiction without count of the Count of Avignon. Someone here was filming the actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear about it, one of the most despised people in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first films to have cameo appearances not filled with stars like themselves. You'll see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman etc., just being themselves in and around the movie colony. This in itself makes Show People a film that deserves to be saved. <br /> <br /> Show People also made good use of the standard Tin Pan Alley songs like, I'm Not Fun, I'm Sitting On Top Of The World, you'd be surprised, California, here I am. As the film came out on the cusp of the sound being introduced, a song called Crossroads was introduced. It is not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and the girl who sing it on the soundtrack. I believe that since they were not seen, it was felt that no billing was required. Anyway, I'd like to know and I'm sure you would if you were lucky enough to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see why Marion Davies enjoyed this movie so much and considered it a personal favorite. She seems so comfortable in this film and in her real life the lack of fiction shines in her performance which makes it a real pleasure for the public.
