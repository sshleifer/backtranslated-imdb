Excellent comedy starring Dudley Moore with the support of Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud who speaks well. Moore is Arthur, a man from a multimillion-dollar family, who was going to get $ 750 million on condition that he marry a woman (Susan) from another billionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but eventually refused when he met the nice and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he didn't work, he just enjoyed drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before their marriage. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur even though the latter knew that his life will change in the near future. This comedy is a good life lesson for everyone. The rich are generally not happy with their way of life.
