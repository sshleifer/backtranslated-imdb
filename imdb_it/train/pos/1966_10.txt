I'm not a regular commentator on this site, but seeing how undervalued this film is, I try to write some comments and comments about it. I enjoyed watching this movie, maybe because Cat is all I wish I could be, I'm not going to post spoilers or reveal conspiracies but there are things that I've found really incredible, the way it manipulates people is so divine. this is an undervalued film, I miss subjects here, I usually have fun and then I don't talk much about it, when you go to the cinema it's fun, and I really liked the 1h53 that I stayed in the dark room. a must seen over and over again until the pleasure fades. let's try not to be so critical about it. Thanks for reading.
