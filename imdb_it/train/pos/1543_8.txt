I remember watching this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I'd love to see it again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? As a souvenir, it was a particularly powerful film, in particular the scene that stands out is that of horses wearing gas masks. Apart from that, I really can't remember the story too much - and that's why I want to see it again! I surfed the web but can't find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - maybe there are no DVDs or VHS of this film on the market. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me about this. Thank you very much in advance for your assistance. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
