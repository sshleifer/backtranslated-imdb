Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer against Kramer combined with Pan's Labyrinth's imagination. Even the initial special effect seems to give Pan's Labyrinth a nod. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago and in this way it has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, an only child, practically alone on a summer vacation, dealing with his broken family. It's a horror film like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror film for the thinking person. If you are looking for a slasher movie, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is both moving and full of suspense, this is the movie for you. At the screening I saw, I swear there was a time when the whole audience screamed. I highly recommend taking this movie.
