I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it's a movie and not a movie because it was apparently shot by HBO to be shown on the cable network starting this year. This film presents Page as a fetish tweezers of slavery and discipline and a B & D movie actress who has had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that and the film touches some of its other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the pinup icon of the 1950s. This film is apparently based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. It is shot in black and white for the nostalgic feeling of the 50s. I have the book called "Bettie Page The life of a legend of Pinup" which has many beautiful photos that tell the career of Page and I must say that this film reproduces on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of those famous photos with precision . Mol herself with Bettie Page's black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does she look like Bettie Page but she has the smile and the features of her personality that came out through the camera. And his body is as close as possible to a Page replica. Exceptional casting. The story is rather thin and tabloid and certainly could have been much better. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it 7.0 on a scale of 10 and recommend seeing it when it comes to TV.
