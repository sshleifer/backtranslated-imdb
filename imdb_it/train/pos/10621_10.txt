In a nutshell, this is the best movie to come out of Michigan from ... well, never! Evil Dead eats your heart, Hatred of A Minute has been one of the most bizarre and best films to be seen by this reviewer for a long time. I recommend this film to anyone who needs a head trip, or a good case of chills!
