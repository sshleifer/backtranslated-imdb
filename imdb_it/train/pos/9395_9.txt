If you like plot turns, this is your movie. It is impossible at any time to predict what will happen next. Nothing is how it looks or ends as you think it will be. The characters are all gritty and engaging. The cage is at its best. Dennis Hopper still shows his delightfully sinister side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a superb film debut in a cameo. I categorize this film as "I'm having a really, really, really bad movie". Not a slow minute in this movie. A real sleeper. This film is undervalued and, unfortunately, neglected.
