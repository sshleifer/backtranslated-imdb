Why can't directors create horror films like "The Shining" today? There is an easy answer to this: modern filmmakers are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick has shown once and for all with this film that he is truly one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> So, the plot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family move to a large secluded hotel to watch him for the low season. The kicker is that the previous hotel keeper savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can be more easily summarized from the title of the film, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first film to hit as "scary" a long time ago. "They are some seriously messy things, but in a positive sense. One of the things that adds to the fear factor is the incredible music. music was an important part of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a few) and it certainly doesn't disappoint with that. The score sets the tone completely and this movie wouldn't be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on the legendary performance of Nicholson Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer, in fact, only his gaze steals some scenes from this film, it is a first-class acting that must to be seen to believe. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror film that matches this enough REST IN PEACE Stanley.
