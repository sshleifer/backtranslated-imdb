This film was released 12 years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something about the New York drag scene. Endurance performance textbooks say nothing about these fashion houses. The "Great Pretenders" by Anthony Slide do not say anything. "The Drag Queens of New York: a guide to the illustrated field" by Julian Fleisher with his flow chart of influence that brings together Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol's queens and the club scene of the 90s - and postdate the film completely ignore the houses. Also "The Changing Room" by Laurence Senelick - the closest thing we have to a definitive book on drag performance quickly escapes beyond the film and does not provide the basic information one would have expected from it. <br /> <br /> I understand from the movie itself, and various articles I found on the web that this home system dates back decades. The main cinematographic performance of a member of the house before 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the largest missing part of "Paris is Burning". <br /> <br /> The film is precious because it focuses on an otherwise ignored scene. It is a precious snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals that includes a real murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in his literal closet, but this didn't come out until three years later. <br /> <br /> Of historical importance, but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that offers more context.
