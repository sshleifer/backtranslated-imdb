September 11 is a classic example of true cinema, a kind of realist documentary, in this case of New York firefighters fighting against one of the most extraordinary events in the history of the world. They are all small, discreet, portable video cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the shots (and by the director, Naudet's hand that frequently cleans the screen). <br /> <br /> In this film, you get to know most of the firefighters - Tony Benatatos, the rookie (or "probie", in the New York fireman's vernacular), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who discovers that he lost his brother later) and a few others. There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, only to emphasize the personal and reflective nature of the events. The modernization is quite dramatic and well done, in particular the ceremony of breaking through the Fire Department, with some useful pavilions and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited film (just like Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The viewpoint and angle of the camera is usually between the firefighters, which is interesting and there are excellent shots inside the WTC1 lobby while Pfeiffer and his team plan what do next - this is the classic true cinema. There is also the disturbing and disturbing sound of the occasional human body crashing into the outer porch. It is then that an increasingly abandoned Chief of Fire Pfeiffer realizes that his task is hopeless and probably hopeless - and this is before the WTC2 collapses. You must give Naudet credit to know which faces to film and at what time. <br /> <br /> The sound of the collapsing neighbor WTC2 is so terribly sad, moving and terrifying that you realize what a tough test it is for the firefighters From the lobby, it seems, seems and seems like the end of the world and the poor firefighters they seem so completely disoriented and scared. You hear a huge rumbling and trembling maelstrom - like that of a giant monolithic beast that slowly falls to the ground after being mortally wounded - the nearby tower has collapsed and the fire team that remains in WTC1 does not realize this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should be avoided - cues like "this was really a day like no other" or the frequently banal statements of Naudet as "you can see fear in the eyes of all "and" I knew Tony was going crazy "! The film is really just a long video diary. There are no photos from above the building where some of the firefighters went. Imagine that this film merged with the CCTV footage of some of the higher rooms or a journalistic coverage of the day. The effect would be greater. You could also combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and, perhaps, of the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla who literally was many plans in which to play the hero. <br /> <br /> I don't see much of an element of propaganda in this film, as some reviewers suggest. This film is not a triumph of the will, of Riefenstahl. Some time later the firefighters draped the American flag over a nearby and surviving building that looked at what became Ground Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also some dubious camerawork moments; for example, who keeps the camera when the two Naudet brothers meet again at the fire station? Is it on stage? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent ending, very much in the tradition of the excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, sparkling.
