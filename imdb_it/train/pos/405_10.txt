I was a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years at school. This film is the best fantasy film of recent years. I don't think "action" is the right genre, even if there are many actions and Kongese scenese. Wait, did I mention that this is an ORIENTAL moive fantasy? Please keep in mind that you do NOT use the hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the boy who "shit" around, I don't blame you, because you're still young and you need to learn more about "culture".
