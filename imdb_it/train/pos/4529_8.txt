As is well known among the long-haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in the silent slanders of this Herr Graf, during the summer the aristocrats love to travel to exclusive and distinct places to avoid the heat and also the hordes of coarse people who take it easy . These bizarre trips around the world also take place in "Three Ages", a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. <br /> <br /> Obviously this German count most liked the first segment centered on the stone age because of the affinity that this aristocrat feels in that ancient era. preferring this to the second segment that takes place during the glory of Rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman empire, ie the barbarians, or the same thing, the Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place in modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago it should be qualified as modern. <br /> <br /> The leitmotiv that drives Herr Keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and amusing events in three different eras, is the search for love, a very complicated subject to understand for the aristocrats who prefer the search for money and personal interest. Whenever "Three Ages" is shown in the Schloss theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a witty and witty silent film (even for a serious German count), a work full of gags and gadgets, word games, acrobatics and stunts, visual and stunning technical tricks, an absolute silence that is perfect to allow to bear the various and rough summer severities. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to temporarily take leave because this German count must flirt with an old Teutonic heiress who is not his age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
