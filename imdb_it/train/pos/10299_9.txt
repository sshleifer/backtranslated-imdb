I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed at my ass during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like his serious films, in particular Truman Show. This is a cross between his VERY funny side and his serious side. It's obviously VERY fun in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and pulls it off very easily. it's really a multi-function actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with the acting of Jennifer Aniston. I think she's more than just a couple of nice tits and a nice ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool god. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY fun, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I should evaluate this at 9. Good acting, funny script and some very serious situations make this a great movie.
