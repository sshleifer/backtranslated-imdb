When I found the film in the Christmas program, the title didn't seem familiar to me since I didn't read the novel and I didn't hear anything about the film. However, after reading the content, I decided to spend my Christmas night watching the movie. The effect totally surprised me: I don't remember when I last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. A VOW TO CHERISH is, without any doubt, one of the films that now constitutes a real surprise that I received from the cinema. Here are some of my arguments because I consider this film a piece of good undervalued cinema. <br /> <br /> First, the entire content is particularly educational. It has something to offer the modern public: pure upright faith and some answers to universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our times? Does love still count? Why is there faith? What is the logic of the burden and suffering in life? Is there really someone by my side that I can always trust? The film provides the answers through the content because everything that happens to the characters could also happen to some of us. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is exceptionally human. The main characters experience inner struggles and face extremely difficult decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own life and forget about the family or keep the values ​​they were taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman he falls in love with? In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him ... Yet, he decides to swear eternal loyalty to HIS WIFE. If John's rebellious brother, Phil (D. David Morin), went better in his easy life even if he didn't give him satisfaction or once he started thinking seriously about his life. Phil a Dio's prayer in the park is a psychological masterpiece of the universal aspect of humanity. These words could be said to everyone, regardless of where, when and how they live. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is a great family portrait, not very popular nowadays: there are still problems, there is always something more powerful that brings these people together. This "something" is love and trust. I know it might seem a little idealistic. Not all families can count on loyalty and it may not be that simple. However, it is a very educational and realistic aspect. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, the entire film focuses on the mutual help of people. If we want to live a happy life in our society, we must understand one thing: we must help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of this attitude. At the beginning of the film, we see him talking to John about prayer. Later, help his brother. Alexander is an "angel" who is sent to John and his family. Is it not possible that we can become angels with one another? <br /> <br /> Fifthly, the artistic characteristics also deserve attention. PERFORMANCE: Barbara Babcock plays an authentic interpretation of Ellen and, although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. Think, for example, of the moment he appears at school and badly wants to teach again. Ken Howard is also memorable as a faithful husband. PHOTO: The most memorable thing for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on fallen leaves (autumn) while the sun (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted it as a sort of symbol: even if there is pain, this can always be illuminated by light and joy ... <br /> <br /> A vote for the world is a wonderful film that showed me realistically what it means to love, to be faithful, once again showed me how beautiful it is to live and believe. In the end, I would like to mention the deep words of the film that I found very moving and I hope you will also do <br /> <br /> Kyle to his uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But nobody forces you to do it. Yet according to which rules do you live?
