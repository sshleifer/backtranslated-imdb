<br /> <br /> An old man works as a janitor in a psychiatric hospital to be close to his wife who is there patiently and to try to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of Japanese cinema. A long lost thought, a print found in the 70s and an added soundtrack, which perfectly fits the images. He may have been influenced by the doctor Caligary cabinet (director Kinugasa claimed he had never seen the German film). However he surpasses him in style and in his most convincing (and cold) portrait of the inner mental state of the prisoners in the asylum. To achieve this goal, the film uses every single cinematographic technique available at the moment: multiple exposures and blurred subject viewpoints, inclined camera angles, rapid and slow movement, expressionist lighting and overlapping among others. It is also a very complicated film to follow, as it does not have captions. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a montage of rain that hits the windows of the hospital, the wind that shakes the trees and thunder. The disturbing time metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder acts as music that incites the dancer to enter a frenetic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenetic dance, he is observed by other inmates. The multiple exposures of the dancer represent the point of view of the patients and their confused "vision" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this fantastic film that seeks to represent the subconscious of patients and the vision of "healthy" world. <br /> <br /> In three words MUST SEE.
