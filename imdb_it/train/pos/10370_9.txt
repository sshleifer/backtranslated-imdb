Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. While I was watching this film, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching O.J. Debacle of Simpson (although I have very different opinions on the innocence of individuals in every situation). <br /> <br /> The Australian media, if this film is to be believed, have devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth has been left in the background. It was scary to see the scenes of invasions, swarms of media hordes, ridiculous reports of half-truths and lies and debates on the alleged merits of the case by people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> Equally frightening is the depiction of the media as indifferent and incomprehensible to technical information in the case. I hope more has been done about the problem of religious prejudice in the case (the accused are seven-day Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today these circuses have become common but this makes the lesson only more important. /> <br /> Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. Australian accents become a little thick at times, but not incomprehensible.
