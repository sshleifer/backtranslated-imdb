A quiet, sweet and wonderfully nostalgic film about how to confront old friends and the surroundings of your youth with all the memories, problems and pains of the present with you. A film that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old jealousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Mischief, fridge-night raids and all the other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters have the opportunity for a week to experience it again, as the old camp leader now retires and wishes to meet the children of the golden years of the camp. All of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their career.
