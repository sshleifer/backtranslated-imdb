Not having seen the film in the original version of the theater, I was happily surprised when the DVD arrived, as this film did not have the wide distribution it deserved. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington made his directorial debut and the finished product has nothing to envy other films on the same subject by more experienced directors. The film looks very professional. It shows that Mr. Washington learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He has a different perspective on this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is, without a doubt, Derek Luke's beautiful performance. He is an actor who, with the right guidance, will go far, no doubt. His interpretation of the tormented young man, at this point in his life, in turmoil and suffering for a bad life, until now, has treated him, it is very true. His Antwone is a beautiful portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give, but nobody seems to see that side of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst moment of his despair, Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, though somewhat submissive way. Because of the anguish in Antwone, he lacks the opportunity to open up to this man, who wants to help, but because of the constraints placed in his office, he has only three sessions and then he must dismiss his patient. <br /> <br /> Things are going well, as Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse suffered by Mrs. Tate, her adoptive mother, is nothing short of brutal. The attempt by an old woman in Tate's house to have sexual harassment gives Antwone a bitter taste that remains with him throughout his adult life, as it was marked by the shame he brings with him. <br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to let him see a world different from the love she has and the support she gives him. <br /> <br /> The first performances are really good. Even Dr. Davenport of Denzel Washington has his problems. He isn't a happy camper either. He can help Antwone, but he can't help himself, or his relationship with an adoring wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a nice Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a good actress, is as superb as Ms. Tate, the abusive adoptive mother. <br /> <br /> The meeting of Antwone with his unknown family is a little too sugary and sentimental, but obviously, if one is to believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, one must also accept that part of the film.
