Eytan Fox did it again: move the heart of the viewer into a modest story that takes place in an overwhelming chaos. The film also manages to describe the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv so perfectly and subtly. I was there a month ago and it's all there: the lifestyle, the relationships, the beating heart of the city, the chaos, the grip of utopian mentality in the most carefree, carefree and unaware megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend: it is a journey for the heart and the mind, with an interesting perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note: There is a central gay storyline in the film. If you don't think you're too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as "just love". (and don't worry: the girl is hot too!)
