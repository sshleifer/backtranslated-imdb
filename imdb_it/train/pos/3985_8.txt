I saw it as a TV movie late in the evening, by pure chance. The script of the film said something about the effect the mother has with her daughter and continues her romantic journey, while tuning the carpenter to work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately obvious. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the love interest of the homonymous carpenter mother is also her daughter's boyfriend, so there are not many surprises. But I had been captivated by the engaging performance of Anne Reid and was fascinated. The management gives her plenty of space to fix the mirrors and adjust the scarves, when she oozes sadness. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were fascinating and broke the taboos. Should the bodies of older women not remain hidden? Not here and we are treated to a delightful awakening in Mother's sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings he has made (SPOILER!) Once discovered they confirm his daughter's suspicion that something is going on here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter didn't convince me enough like the rest of the cast, but that could be me. With his waves of pre-Raph locks, I expected to see Julia Sawahla, whose most intense face would best adapt the clashes to my mind. Bradshaw has a happier, rounder face that has not brought the anger that emerges as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The ending is weak. If the farewells for the mother who leaves in disgrace are so indifferent, then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those who greet and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she is a newly grieving widow who leaves for the lonely house she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of strident compassion. For a film so full of emotions (and be warned that it's like opening the champagne, you'll never have the lid again) the ending is a cold contradiction.
