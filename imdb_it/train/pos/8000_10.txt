... do not read the summaries of the plot because in words the plot might seem trivial, cerebrally and useless. The film is excellent, the acting of Denzel and Dakota (which will go to the stars, believe me) is simply fabulous, and the plot is amazing. Actually "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is based only on real facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that contributes to the shock I had during and after the film. If you are a fan of both actors and slightly unbalanced films, you haven't yet looked at your favorite yet ... Trust me, in the end you'll have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The film is fantastic, see it, rent it, buy it or anything else ... just don't lose it
