One of the many cartoons by Merrie Melodies that entertained American spectators during World War II, Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" portrays a wandering flea laying on Elmer Fudd's dog. The child turns into a real sadist while he is building a house on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog: "One more scwatch and I'll take a bath!" Meanwhile, the flea is preparing dynamite on the dog! * And it's not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer is reading a comic with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs are often co-stars, but Elmer has never acted with Porky (unless it contains the very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But for me, the thought of Elmer who reads about these other famous characters of his own genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew of their existence in his universe even if they do not appear in this cartoon. > <br /> Of course, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure the cardboard was intended as pure entertainment and certainly entertains. As for the phrase "I could get to this", it seems that it was something that the censorship would not have allowed, but that somehow failed; I, for example, actually don't know how it should sound. Was it something sexual? As for the end, if I had thought I had seen it all, I would have been tempted to look for more, rather than do what the cat did (even if it was a perfect trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons certainly had something for TNT, didn't they?
