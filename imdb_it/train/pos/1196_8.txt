I watched several days of filming of this movie that summer, the end result being just two scenes from the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the cart, stop the wagon, etc. So this young Dakota could not wait to see the film and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was torn down so that the shooting scenes were real. (yes, Doris, the animals were injured during filming) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A great western / social commentary of the 1950s. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real Western drama or used as a social statement as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for the youth of the 50s.
