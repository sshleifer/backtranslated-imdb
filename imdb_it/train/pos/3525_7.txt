Dude, this is a hard DVD to find. I could only find it in Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Well ... yes. Not so much because it is a masterpiece of cinema, even if directed by Curt Siodmak (the titles on IMDb.com read "Robert" but the list of DVD credits Curt), or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other mysteries of murder - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my ten-year curiosity for the film was finally satisfied. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a respected but independent engineer (Alan Curtis) was stopped up by his separated wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two tickets to the show in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the music festival. She accepts, a little sadly. The mopey bartender gives them the eye as they leave. <br /> <br /> In the show, the stormy star notices that this lady in the audience wears the same hat and explodes off-stage angrily. The band's drummer, Cook, looks at the silent woman but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her house and asks for her name, but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know her. If she had been a devotee of Longfellow she would have said something about the ships passing by at night. <br /> <br /> Ok, Curtis comes home and finds his wife killed in his absence. The chief police officer, Gomez, hands him over to the district attorney. His only alibi is that he was with a ghost woman that no one else seems to remember - not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the taxi driver ("Al Alp"), not the drummer - and the same lady has disappeared, it's impossible dig. <br /> <br /> Curtis is sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez thought and decided that he is probably innocent because no one with a brain would have invented such a stupid story. He joins Curtis' loving secretary, Ella Raines, to investigate the case informally again. <br /> <br /> They visit the alleged witnesses again. The threatening bartender is hit by a car, perhaps by mistake, so he's out of the picture. The irritated Latina left because the show was closed and she is uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real killer, but not before being inserted into a scene where she beats the drums in an impromptu jazz group. His sweaty face takes on an expression that does not suggest an intense concentration, but rather a monstrous, orgasmic madness. His eyeballs roll towards the ceiling, his mouth opens wide, his hammering becomes frantic. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Nobody's performance is otherwise exceptional, but all are quite professional. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best interpretation, however, is probably from Franchot Tone. He is the real murderer and falsifies his alibi. It is reserved and artistic. Even when he faints, he is decorous. I don't know how to describe it accurately, but Tone seems to think and simply play his part. Alan Curtis as an innocent engineer is close to zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to a painting B. <br /> <br /> I don't know why it is considered classic. It's really your basic Cornell Woolrich murder, not as good as some of his others. But the direction of Siodmak is sensitive. A man is hit and his hat is wrapped in a gutter with water flowing around him. His use of shadows is silent. <br /> <br /> Glad to have understood it.
