In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a TV Too Young To Die where they both played the same kind of parts they do in Kalifornia. I have no doubt that it was their casting in this movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes in a sort of rocky relationship due to Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and entering in the mind and soul of serial killers. In fact it has an unusual odyssey, it wants to cross the country and visit the sites of some famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are broke. <br /> <br /> Destiny intervenes in more ways than financials with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, a couple of strange southern types who agree to divide the cost of gas in this cross-country journey. It turns out that Pitt is himself a serial killer and decides to do a little research on his own, digging into the mind of someone who is fascinated by love. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not the kind of film you usually go for, but in reality Brad Pitt's acting ability and charisma make it work to a large extent. Pitt is the walking definition of a Gothic refugee born of Deliverance. But better than him is Juliette Lewis, who once again interprets these low levels of self-esteem which she seems to be doing well. Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes's reactions should be shown in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their slasher films, they are no better than Kalifornia.
