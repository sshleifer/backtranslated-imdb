I was also very surprised to see how few people voted for this film, and you MUST write something about it, even though my comments are quite similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like many things film. The splendid acting between Mastroianni and Loren. The way in which the film is narrated: humanity and love develop slowly between these two outsiders, and contrast with the inhuman and simultaneously continuous rhythm of the fascist radio announcer (who seems to be a colleague of Mastroianni) and the adherents "going to and coming from the show". For me this is a very nice film about what it means to be human. Perhaps some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" was delivered too clearly, but to me this did not destroy the film in any way. My vote is 10/10.
