Making a book in a movie following the story page after page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically begin to create their own "mental film" about who the characters are, where they live, how situations progress. Everyone's opus of the eye is different, and that's why when the 'REAL' movie comes out, you'll always have a segment of the outgoing audience that is disappointed that they simply don't measure up. <br /> <br /> All screenwriters and directors can hope to achieve whatever their vision of the film is, and hope that it gets as close as possible to what the public expects to see. /> <br /> There is no better case for this situation than for movies based on Stephen King novels. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of their stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE ZAD ZONE), or they can be what fans consider a terrible mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING, the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Although it is not even close to being the perfect adaptation of the King, PET SEMATIO has so many moments of discomfort only skin and bones that seemed to have bled on the screen directly from the book, which you can practically forgive his shortcomings. For this, we must thank the music video director Mary Lambert (she also directed SIESTA, not exactly a horror movie, but another crazy-from-hell that you should see on your list), working from a script of the same 'Man -ster ', and probably one of his best. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know the story, I won't put you to sleep with too much detail. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) transferred his family to the perfect house in the country. Well, almost perfect, apart from two small unpleasant details: the dangerously crowded stretch of the interstate highway in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods at the back. Since Louis is a vet and has a small child for a child ... well, even if you haven't read the book, you do the math. It is a story of the king, after all, so no mystery where this is directed. <br /> <br /> It is not so much the destination that counts here, but the spectral stops along the way. Some scenes so familiar from the book are brought to a terrible and screaming life: Rachel Creed (STAR ​​TREK'S Denise Crosby), horrible memory of her terminally ill sister, paralyzed; Louis's meetings with jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) were mortally wounded, both before and after his death; the journey to the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act ... if it doesn't give you any nightmares, maybe you should check the beat. <br /> <br /> Good performances of all here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best joke in history that sums it all up: "Sometimes, dead is better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film version is the casting of Louis's son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be almost impossible to get the kind of performance needed by a boy of that age to seal the deal on this, Lambert and the crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes at the time was just too much damned to "sell" his role as an evil zombi possessed by demons. This takes you out of the movie whenever it shows up, even if the scenes in which it is present are still masterfully staged, (especially the scene of Gwynne's death.) <br /> <br /> Apart from that, everything the rest is still as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title of best adaptation of the king for me; but SEMATARY is right there in the Top Five. <br /> <br /> Again, anything adapted to the screen based on a King book will be as terrific as reading the story? Probably not BLOODY ... for now.
