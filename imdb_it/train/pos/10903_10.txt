This man is nothing short of amazing. You really feel like you've lived his life with him during these tragic events, and finally cry with his family. He was so passionate about his cause, not only for himself, but to ensure that others who survive him should not go through this miserable pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad day or "down", and always manages to show me the most beautiful and bright side of life, just like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not knowing Jonny before, how I visited England twice during his life, and I could say that I had met him. It's comforting to know that Jonny is sitting on his cloud, without pain! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
