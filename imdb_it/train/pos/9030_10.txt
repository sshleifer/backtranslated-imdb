This film took me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "chick flick". Boy, he was wrong! This film has a great fascination for the family, without sex scenes like the other films. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job as Homer Hickam. The supporting cast is also great. <br /> <br /> Science, advanced age, family quarrels, a great train scene ... This film has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented in a rather loud manner. The music of the 50s pushes the film beyond the limits of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD definitely deserves its attention on coal. The reproduction value is fantastic - I've seen it several times already.
