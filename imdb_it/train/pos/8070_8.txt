I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Oscar for best actor for this film due to a three-part division of the Bounty mutineers of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a good film because John Ford wouldn't have gotten his first Oscar for Best Director, if he wasn't. No split involved in his prize. <br /> <br /> The film and the story of Liam O'Flaherty on which it is based involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was expelled for a kind of fool who pulled and wants to return. It's down to the last penny and if it can't come back, it wants enough for the ride to America. There is a reward of twenty pounds for information that leads to the arrest of a former partner named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan police and informs McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is quite anxious to find out who took McPhillip and I'm pretty sure it was McLaglen. He doesn't have the intelligence to really cover his tracks. He makes a weak effort to involve another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. Also takes a coat hanger interpreted by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The entire action of The Informer takes place in Dublin in 1922 from six in the evening until early the next morning. Of necessity it is turned into darkness and shadow, making it perhaps the first noir thriller. If it had been made after World War II, the Informer would have been classified as a great classic noir, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man who doesn't look much alike. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this great world. He took some time off during the rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before he was anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays IRA commander Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has it here. My hypothesis is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give cinema fans some radical interest. It makes it clear that Foster must eliminate the informant because the Black and Tans will take it and take a little more and put the entire organization in danger. <br /> <br /> The IRA scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of their court, Meek is unable to say no. Justice and the mandate of the king do not work here. At this point it illustrates graphically, despite the occupation by army troops and armed forces, the British are really losing their grip on the population. <br /> <br /> Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches, but rather few than you'd expect. Even though McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken binge, the IRA is constantly in the shadows looking at him and counting every penny. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a story well told about Ireland in a sad and dismal period.
