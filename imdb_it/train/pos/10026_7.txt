Without Kirsten Miller this project was not to be completed. However with the beauty and talent that inspire fear is Miss Miller, I would certainly recommend it. It seemed that the other actors were just playing his strong performance. Wagner's sad attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are about writing and the plot, the group of talented people gathered did a heroic job of recovering what should have been a disaster. The charismatic delivery and Miller's times were impeccable and credible. She interprets that thin line between assertive and overbearing, but never offensive, it is actually the structural engineer who claims to be. I wish I had seen it on the big screen but unfortunately I was lucky enough to rent it before it was lost.
