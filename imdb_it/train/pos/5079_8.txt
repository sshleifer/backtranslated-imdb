Well, first I would like to make it clear that Kaakha Kaakha is a part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated means "to protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the Tamil film industry is quite full of purely commercial initiatives, any Rajnikanth or Vijay film would hold the will to this statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT film with an excellent soundtrack. Certainly very stunning in the final scene, in particular I love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). The gore is quite excessive at times, but certainly this is a great movie!
