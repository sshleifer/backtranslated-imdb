I was really impressed with this movie. The writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to be emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this film have really hit the nail on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer sucked straight into their world. Moreover, the music is fantastic. They took some independents to score, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the film. If you have the chance to watch this movie in a small theater or a film festival (as I did), I highly recommend going to see it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this film. This is reason enough to go and have a look.
