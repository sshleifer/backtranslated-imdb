Initially I was doubtful about this film (simply because of the subject), but the richly designed characters, the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it worthy of being watched. Initially I had difficulty distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed they became more and more distinct. I'm still haunted by the final scene.
