The choice of Sylvester Stallone to play the protagonist of Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is the kind of hard and steep person who previously made the aura audaciously daring and necessary to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing the Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is an unlikely notion. <br /> <br /> The beautifully crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue that will engulf them in the resulting bloodthirsty and dangerous encounter with the outlaws. Robbery and the high-altitude transfer of cash in suitcases from one plane to another is something that has not been filmed before. <br /> <br /> The bitter cold of the snowy Alps and the deception in place and the betrayal between the antagonist forces make one shudder with trepidation. The forces of terrifying adventure and ruthless murder lead the drama to the end. <br /> <br /> Good films are not made every year and people do not enjoy looking at their eyes from time to time. Regardless of the dirty language / language that gives cheeky excitement during some scenes, the film can be considered as one that is not going to vanish its captivating charm, even looking at it after so many years.
