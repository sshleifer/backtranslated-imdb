This is a beautiful film. The real story of a bond between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks at his best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has good boy roles. Yet in this film, he comes out in this film a bit gritty, but the murder of his character still emerges like a rose, even up to the last scene. The cast of this film has been well put together. I also like the part when there is total silence when the character of Tom Hanks shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and yet profound about not sounding in that scene, just simply emotion. I love the look of John Rooney, the face of Paul Newman's character when he realizes even before he sees it, who is the character of Tom Hanks who retaliates, and knows that his destiny has arrived. The first time I saw this movie I was amazed and I knew I had to go out and get the video and I since then, adding it to my collection of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.
