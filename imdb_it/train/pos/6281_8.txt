I had the chance to watch several BluRay and HD DVD movies. This film remains for its wonderful action and great history. Even if you are looking for a movie with an excellent photo, this is not the case. Not having this movie on DVD helped simplify the purchase. I have always appreciated the intense action and excellent acting that do not always go together. Overall, this is what makes this movie fun to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you have two things. An image that is almost crystal clear without distortion or a grainy HD image film. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu-ray movie. I almost started thinking that it was a blu ray standard. Although after seeing other films, I know better. I don't think they spent all the time they were supposed to transfer this HD movie. This is generally the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray and Blue Ray Disc players you should only have the best image. So I consider this just a worthwhile investment for people who have never seen the movie or who haven't bought the DVD version.
