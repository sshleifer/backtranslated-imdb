I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say it's the best horror movie produced for $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Sorry Steckler). The film is definitely worth looking for if you are a zombie fan. This film smells of soul and atmosphere. Some of the zom shots are the best ever made for cinema. The slimy and dusty dead, with their webbed bodies, move slowly to their screaming victims. Brrrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot saggy Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you worried before the HORROR raises the head of its undead body. This film was fun from beginning to end. I could not ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
