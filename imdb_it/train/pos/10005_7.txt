Yes, it's an art ... to successfully create a slow-paced thriller. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in beautiful volumes while you don't even realize it's happening. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams' excellent performance. The sexuality angles in the film may seem unnecessary and can probably influence how much you like the movie. However, the main plot is very engaging. The movie doesn't rush at you and still grabs you enough to make you wonder. The management is good. The use of lights to achieve the desired effects of suspense and unexpected is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice 1 clock time if you're trying to relax and listen to an electrifying story!
