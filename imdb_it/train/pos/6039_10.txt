I was lucky to be an extra in this great movie and I loved every minute of the shoot. I went to the premiere in London and had a nice chat with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon like my wife did. Fantastic after party. Then a few weeks later I took a trip to the cinema with the members of our bike club. What a brilliant film, it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue, my wife can't get enough, not even children. Take a little club from the club that seems to think I'm a movie star now, oh, well, you can only dream. I think they're just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the shoot was the weather, the rain, the rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. I hope there will be a follow up so keep me informed Jon. Danny Beck
