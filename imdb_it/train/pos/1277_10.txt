I consider this film the best of Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's performance the definitive Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements in the Mickey Spillane novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and makes good use of light and shadow. John Alton's camera work is top notch, as is the Franz Waxman soundtrack. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have received more opportunities. I have always enjoyed this film.
