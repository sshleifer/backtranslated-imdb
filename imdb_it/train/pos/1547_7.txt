Like almost everyone else who commented on this film, I can only wonder why this never appeared on video. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him around the age of 12 on "The Late Show", circa 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and the strangely dressed horses. (I don't remember the most horrible pieces I saw here, they were probably cut for the television audience.) But the scenes that I really liked were those that related to the death of Lord Kitchener aboard the HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago . The scenes of the condemned cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were truly chilling, as I recall. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the musical score, but the comments of others now intrigue me. Take this on video!
