This film is fine as I said, but it is certainly necessary to see it as it is worth watching. These are two Mac and Sam guys who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the time to laugh starts when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating three hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious. Sam reaches luck and almost forgets his friend but not completely. But Mac thinks so and so he starts dating the hostesses. there is garam masala at every step of the film, rock songs but something is missing. The comedy is not up to par and deserves a prize. It's beautiful but not so excellent. Some people laughed until their stomachs hurt but they didn't deserve much laughter. But of course everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie you are welcome.
