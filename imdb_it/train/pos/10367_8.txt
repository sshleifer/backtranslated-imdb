When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw him, I was shocked by what he portrayed. When I saw it a second time in an Australian cinema class, I made a second point: communication problems. You see, when a dingo kidnapped Lindy Chamberlain's daughter (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were grieving but didn't show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and therefore could not mourn it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, they all started believing that Lindy did it alone. <br /> <br /> The point is that the wrong message was communicated to the public and turned people against Lindy. Although this was a pure accident, it still happened. It could be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of the media, regardless of the political opinions of any media outlet. <br /> <br /> As for performance, Streep does a great job with an Australian accent (no surprises there), and Sam Neill is just as great. You will probably only be wiped out by what you see here. Definitely one of the best Fred Schepisi films ever.
