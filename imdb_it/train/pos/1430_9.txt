He was playing in our theater in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was sold out, so we focused on that, not knowing anything about it if it wasn't a documentary on the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune as it was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we share with the rest of the inhabitants of the Earth. This film has some of the most breathtaking photographs I've ever seen in a movie and took me from deserts to oceans to rainforests and showed things I've never seen in a movie, on TV or in a book! "Earth" is a film that every student should see before becoming tired. I will encourage my niece to watch this movie as she will inherit the planet we leave them. This is also a movie to watch on a movie screen or on a very large TV, since photography is so powerful and exotic.
