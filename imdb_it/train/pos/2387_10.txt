I have a six-month-old baby at home and occasionally fights really bad sleep. One morning he had a particularly difficult time when he started sleeping when the bump doodle theme song appeared on T.V. She stopped crying almost instantly, and for the rest of the show she was happy. I sat her on the inflatable seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms and actually laughed at this show. He kept her amused and happy all the time. I also have a video of them so that, at times when my baby is upset, I have something to calm her. Of course, late at night, if you wake up with colic, the doodle bops are not your cup of tea, but they certainly come in handy when I need some time to do housework, etc. The biggest surprise for the doodle bops is that my son doesn't even like to watch T.V. Would prefer to be on the floor playing with a toy or with our little toy poodle to watch T.V. yet, the doodle bops have totally caught his eye. I don't know if he will continue to like it in the future, but for now it is under attack.
