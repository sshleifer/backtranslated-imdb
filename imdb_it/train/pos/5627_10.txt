Actually this move made me jump out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were about to do! The acting was the best, Farrah should have got an Oscar for it, it was fabulous. James Russo was so good that I hated him he was the villain and he interpreted it wonderfully. There are not many films that have impressed me like this. The cast was great, Alfie seemed shocked by Farrah's big eyes that looked like a victim and you relived his horror as he crossed it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger felt that you wanted her to hurt him, but you also knew it was the wrong thing to do. The film made you get on a roller coaster and you went up and down with every scene.
