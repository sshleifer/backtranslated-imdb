I saw the movie before reading Michelle Magorian's book and I enjoyed both. The film, rather than the book, brought me close to tears on several occasions. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never gives up. I encourage as many people as possible to see this masterpiece as soon as possible. I give him ten stars.
