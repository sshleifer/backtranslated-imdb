Note that I didn't say it's better ... just more fun. The lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving. <br /> <br /> Actually, I was surprised that it wasn't a Troma movie, as it has all the Troma brands, including acid liquids, bad guy jokes after every murder, a ridiculous tank rape scene (which is a little difficult to disturb, since the rapist is a snowman), and stupid deputies. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, on which we observe that he has no legs or feet, drives a police cruiser around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Although it should be close to (or below) freezing, no one's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when the cars run. <br /> <br /> 3. The snow reminds you more of polystyrene or polystyrene nostrils than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenager gets her ass for her boyfriend only a few hours after her brother was macabre murdered. She tells him about breaking into the sheriff's house, of all places, to be able to wear it. But first, she tells him he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After Jake's tender age was interrupted by a sled runner, his father discusses with the sheriff that Tommy, the sheriff's son, has something to do with it. The sheriff claims that Tommy wouldn't have fought with Jake because Jake "is at least a meter and a half high by Tommy". At that moment, someone in the background plays, "Not anymore!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff fights with a flat snowman made of some sort of fabric for a long time. This is much better than Tarzan struggling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators fighting with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face at this point. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun movie. There isn't even much blood.
