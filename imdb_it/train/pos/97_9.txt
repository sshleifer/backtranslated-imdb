this was a favorite Christmas special that I wanted to release on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPM got lost, and even the tapes I made have been gone for a long time. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a great John Denver fan was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional, with a spin muppet (in particular Little St. Nick!). It also contains some little-known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Although it was made in the late 70s this show had a timeless feeling. Hoping to find a copy soon !!!
