I was 5 when I saw this musical while I was on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and I immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration to achieve my goals that I set for myself from that moment! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a tough "behind the scenes" entertainment industry during the late 1950s, "Sparkle" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters seeking their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many aspiring young artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to help out. <br /> <br /> The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack contains the plot of each song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for a long term decision-making process, to making the maximum sacrifice to move forward, all three girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent the different paths that could be taken when You have decided to reach your ideal opportunity as a contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This film may have generated ideas for creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway and "Glitter" by Mariah Carey, 25 years later. As a member of the original audience of both productions, I saw many similarities in both stories with "Sparkle", as well as "Saturday Night Fever", "Fame", "Flashdance" and the big off-Broadway hit "Mom, I want to sing.
