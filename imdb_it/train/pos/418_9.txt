This is a roaring western and I've watched it many times and have fun at all levels. However, if after the true facts about such legends such as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested that this is the west when the truth becomes a legend the legend prints. The story moves with an uncertain step, and there is a great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, two very watchable stars that help to make this film. The sharp eyes between you could simply spot Gabby Hayes as an Indian explorer, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn who makes his debut as a Cayenne warrior, in fact he married one of Demilles' daughters in real life. his character of Quinn who informs Cooper of the Custer massacre said in flashback, the ending is well done and when the closing credits merge, he blends the American west with American history. Please take some time to watch this classic western.
