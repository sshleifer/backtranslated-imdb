what can I say about this film that has not already been said? Well, to tell the truth a lot seems very fake like some of the slaps and kicks. as the splendor of Charlie even if it were real I don't know. I'm sure they would have beaten and kicked much harder if he had been. however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil seem very real. and the last needle in the eye scene is incredibly done and it's probably the only thing about the movie that has ever shocked me.
