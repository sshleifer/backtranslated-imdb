When I started watching "Fay Grim", I had no idea it was a sequel to "Henry Fool". Now, this was not a film I imagined had a sequel. But one has arrived, and is quite good. I assume you saw the original, so I won't explain it. This starts with Fay (Parker Posey) who lives with his son he had with Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day, the son is expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But this is not a normal toy. He keeps a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this secret deepens the geopolitics more than "Syriana". <br /> <br /> I must say that I am quite impressed by what Hal Hartley did here. Perhaps this does not quite reach the quality of the original, but it certainly gives a good look at what is happening in the world. And in the end it leaves open the possibility of another sequel. <br /> <br /> Also played by Jeff Goldblum.
