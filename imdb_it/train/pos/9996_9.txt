I have not read the other comments on the film, but judging from the average rating I can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary. I watched it for the second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. True, it wasn't the adults who rolled on the floor, but the sound of children's fun made it sound like this. <br /> <br /> It is a real farce of Mel Brooks, with a lot of moral content - how sad we must be for our money, not for who we are and how fickle our friends and partners are. There are many other films on similar subjects, no doubt, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. It is difficult for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family. <br /> <br /> So for the kids, a 9/10 for me.
