Summary: The morning after his bachelor party, Paul is awakened by his mother-in-law and discovers that there is a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately she is a waitress at the bar, not his girlfriend. And suddenly he shows up everywhere ... the tollbooth of the highway and the supper of his in-laws. And it's hard to keep a secret when his jealous ex-boyfriend followed and photographed him. It's not just about saving your marriage ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: Actually much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something much more fun, something with a small edge. This film was not afraid to take jokes a little further. And now Jason Lee how to deliver the play, especially when his character is half-panic and in trouble, like he is here. And he got good support from the beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a good part as an ex. <br /> <br /> So more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I loved it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
