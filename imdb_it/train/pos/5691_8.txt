I was very interested in seeing this film when it was first released in theaters, however, I wasn't able to make it. So he finally hit the shelves and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I left the DVD in the drive, set it up for a night of murder and pressed play. What followed was one of the most engaging films I've seen in the last two years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Wonderland murders, which led to the most absurd parts of Los Angeles and directly to the biggest porn beginning of the 70s , John Holmes (Val Kilmer). I was captured from the start, and the feeling of the film held me all the way to the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film focused less on real murders and more on previous events and subsequent investigations. Apart from some walls of blood splatters at the beginning and the actual representation of the murders towards the end, the film was more or less an involving show of great dialogues and great acting. Val Kilmer almost sells me as a drugged porn star, and also the "beautiful but it's like that" Bosworth was a joy to watch (and only for his appearance, mind you) <br /> <br /> Personally I felt the best look of the film was, as I said, his lack of openly showing the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so it was not possible to completely see the brutal club given the opening of the sleeping quartet. Furthermore, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to whet the appetite. They were beating with lead pipes, not much else to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was the brief appearance of Carrie Fisher. His portrait of the excessively religious figure was, I believe, a little too banal of his appearance. Maybe that person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I wasn't sold, and for some reason, Fisher looked a little too "akward" in his portrait. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent movie is worth watching, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
