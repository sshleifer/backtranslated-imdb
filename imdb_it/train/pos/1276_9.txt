I love this movie. The noir images combined with Spillane's contemptuous character, Mike Hammer, work wonderfully to create an atmosphere and feeling rarely seen in the low-budget detective films of the early 1950s. It may not be "The Maltese Falcon", but this film makes its own solid contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but his "ladies" are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, as actually played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he meets when he investigates the death of an army friend. When the penny finally drops his face, it's an image. It's nice to see that the censorship of the 1950s didn't force the directors to omit the famous last line. A classic low budget in good faith.
