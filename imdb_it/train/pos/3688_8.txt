Delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also shoots some of the great actors of our time, not only from France, but from everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, arrives in Paris to learn French and also to make sense of her life . <br /> <br /> Montmartre: probably there was no better way to start this film than this segment of the romantic Paris. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: an image of Paris of which we are most aware after the revolts in the Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time looking after someone else's child (it's a nanny) than her own. <br /> <br /> Latin Quarter: so fun to see Gérard Depardieu as the "tenanser de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Eiffel Tower: don't tell me you didn't like those mimes! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: a real pleasure to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who is making a high contact (a no-no) with a girl in the subway. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is fantastic. Also Ludivine Sagnier. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this film makes me want to come back! <br /> <br /> Seen in Barcelona (another major city), at the Verdi, on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
