Originally I saw this movie years ago during the Friday cinema after the dark series (again when the decoder was built like a keyboard), and it intrigued me. Although there is a useless aspect of the film, it is well acted. The performances of Depardieu and Dewaere are very funny. They have a good chemistry together and Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look stunning. A film like this would probably not be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the United States), since it seems to sensationalize things like violence, robbery and casual sex. This film shows that with a talented cast and talented director a good film is a good film, no matter the subject. It saddened me to find out that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the near future I will check him with Depardieu and Miou -Miou in Quit Your Hankerchief.
