All Dog's Go to Heaven is a movie for animated children like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all important in the plot, and even though the kids will do very little, adults will be scratching why this movie was made to look like a kind of gangster movie. The film is not explicit in any way, it is just a strange combination to make a film for children. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a dog player, who owns half the casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (a dog ... getting drunk ... in a children's movie. It sounds strange), Charlie is tricked and killed by Carfax. When he is in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in Heaven. He returns to Earth again and meets his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), and plans the recovery on Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a small orphan Anne Marie held in captivity because of her incredible ability to speak to all animal species, which helps predict breeds. Charlie and Itchy free her, and try to help her find a family, while they learn a lot about themselves. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few non-Disney children and adults alike. Children will have fun with funny characters and lively animations, while adults will appreciate the pleasant and sweet plot and the more than normal characters developed. One thing that keeps him away is that it's a musical. Normally, this is a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump around, playing almost without words, with an almost non-existent instrumental support. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated film, but fortunately the rest of the film is strong enough not to fall apart due to some negative notes. <br /> <br /> The ending of this movie works, but honestly I hate it. He is sad, but happy, but sadder than happy, and makes the film as if he needed a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel to this was, I wish the ending would not guarantee a sequel and would end in a nice super happy ending. This is one of the few films that I like this way, but I do. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great family film, with odd themes, but still good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** on ****. 85 minutes G.
