This is a great film of the lost age of the reactionary drama made for television. My favorite actor of all time, Robert Culp deftly traces a trajectory through false openness and faith in the system, impulsive conservatism and fear of crime and homicidal psychosis. Teenagers are a collection of pure mischievous stereotypes and the final message of this film makes Dragnet's episodes a balanced appearance. But what really shines in this is the film's big step, building fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole California setting. Even the cars are really great, as I remember. I give this film a 10, and I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it's made for television doesn't mean it's not a fantastic art.
