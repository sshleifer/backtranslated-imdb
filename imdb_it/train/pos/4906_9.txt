I don't think this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. This was a simple but interesting plot. It's a good movie to watch when you don't want to think much, you just want a simple story to be told to you. The Canadian scenery was breathtaking. Fall's beautiful shots alone have made the image worth seeing.
