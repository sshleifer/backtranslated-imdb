This film may not put the Catholic church in the best light, but it is telling a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is all beautiful and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that at the moment seem the right thing, but in retrospect they don't look as big as they used to. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family, yes, it incorporates religion, but in reality the story is about a family and the ability of that family to be together, regardless of what is thrown at them. This film is also based on real events which does not mean that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you look at news stories from that period you might see that neither of the two churches handled the incident in a way that was useful to the family. Both churches are at fault, the Catholic Church for having forced such a family regulation in the first place and failed to respond to the ensuing violence and to the Protestant church for telling the mother that she should simply obey her husband and his priest and not fight. In this case, both have disappointed this family. I think the film does a good job in showing this fight both in the church and in the family. In no way is the form or shape putting down the Catholic church, on the contrary, it shows how an accident can change the course of ideas of that religion and how a person can have an effect much more than reach only themselves.
