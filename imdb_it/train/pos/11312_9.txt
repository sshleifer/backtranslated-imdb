Ossessione is in a very bad state but is now undergoing a complete restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a second generation "positive Master" originating from the Visconti press and managed to hide from the fascists. It was scanned on Spirit 4K (as RGB 2K data) then processed using the DaVinci Revival recovery software. After this the rest is manual work and we do not expect to finish before spring. Sometimes next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that the restoration effort will be appreciated for many generations to come.
