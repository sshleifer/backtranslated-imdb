The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four clunkers in Mexico. This is the reference point of the Gothic horror of the mad period of the group. Karloff gives a typically contemptuous and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an eccentric old patriarch who invites many of his small, greedy and clumsy relatives without limits to his creepy dilapidated castle for reading a will. Soon, the hateful guests are expelled by life-size lethal toy people who populate the place. The Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of "Tintorera" disgraces the policeman's hero and Julissa looks absolutely charming as the only cute female character. The clumsy (non) director (non) director, trite script of the numbers, ugly, faded cinematography, ridiculous pieces of the murder (a big and fat drunk is blown up in the face by a miniature cannon!), Score of exaggerated rope, the morbid and gloomy atmosphere, the largely bad acting (Karloff in particular), the mild goto, the poor dubbing and the exciting fiery conclusion give this delicious and terrible lemon a rudimentary charm, decidedly captivating and therefore strangely funny. A real fun campy.
