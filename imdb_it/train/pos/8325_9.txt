I liked the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I saw a trailer for the first time. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as brilliant, playful, a little crazy genius was enough to make me see the movie. Matthau's added spice like Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure fantasy, but delicious. A mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who appears to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfather of Physics, Ed embarks on a mission to win Catherine's heart. Launch a jealous boyfriend (which exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix, and you have fun too. <br /> <br /> The film is full of great character actors and deliciously sweet and daffy. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a mischievous sprite; Cupid with a scrolling rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully catchy while Ed and Meg Ryan play a step above his normal ROM level. Stephen fry is a joy like "RR Ratman" and Ryan's boyfriend; who lacks just one romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film has fallen under most radars, but it is a delightful treasure that does not become stale with repeated visions. It features top-notch writing and performance and is a sweet gift in a not-so-kind world.
