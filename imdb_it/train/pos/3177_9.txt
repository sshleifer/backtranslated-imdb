Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing I don't like about this movie. Cross Eyed has been beautifully filmed. Adam does a great job, not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to any low-budget film. That you don't have to spend much to create something worth watching. There is something that everyone likes. If you had a terrible roommate. if you've ever chosen a dork in high school. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have some kind of sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the kind of movie that will run for a long time and will return to resurface once Adam has a bigger name for himself. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
