Good working times with the Quiroz brothers and the entire cast of this project as "Guy on the Bench". I was stunned by the way they made all the identifiable features of a real horror movie "B". I hope to have the opportunity to work again with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release. Once he was actually in the video store and the girl almost lost her mind. It was pretty funny and this was my first real autograph moment while I signed his receipt. One day I asked the Blockbuster girl if the movie was rented often, and she confirmed by looking at it on the computer. At the time he was renting more than Ring2 which was also a new release at the moment ... The title really captures the immediate interest in more urban markets. He also noticed on many occasions that the film was not returned by the client which led me to believe that the film is so good that people do not want to give it back .... Be careful when ZoMeSe in the hood, because they get ya! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench - 2005)
