I enjoyed watching Red Eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different environment but Wes Craven gave a good rhythm. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice to see a clean and coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as a protagonist. Especially from a director like Craven who brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and now lends itself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie if it hadn't been released in theaters. Good job!
