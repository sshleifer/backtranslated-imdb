This Oscar-winning short film may be among the biggest of its kind. Completely without dialogue, it is a visual pleasure for a boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly lays it in a bowl and then goes to school, leaving the gold fish without guards and a carefree window open. After a while, a nearby orange tabby arrives to rummage, enters through the window and walks slowly towards the bowl. Apparently the fish knows something is happening and gets very excited. As the cat gets very close to the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat takes the fish, drops it into the bowl and comes out of the window entering the moment when the boy, not knowing what happened, comes back. This was incredibly filmed with real animals; how Cousteau made these animals behave this way is remarkable. I just hope this movie was available now for the people to see; I only saw him once, in 1959, when he was released, but he remained unforgettable.
