******* SPOILER! ******** <br /> <br /> I saw this gr8 movie a few years ago, it's a lovely story about a young man who wants to drink his mother's breast milk but thinks he ought to be old for it. ends up wanting another gentleman and ends up competing with his brother who imagines her. throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot be "woken up" and have a blatant but warm story about love, friendship and the beautiful pairs of jugs hehe <br /> <br /> his brilliant > <br /> don't be put off by sub-tit-les hehe!
