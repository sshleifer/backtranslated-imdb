"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films of the 70s and still very persuasive even by today's standards. Although imperfect and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that period) are still very disturbing and stimulating. The quality level of this film surpasses most contemporary SF films due to its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with overpopulation, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in great shape) plays a policeman investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and runs into scandals and dark secrets ... The script is a bit too sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a great surprise, yet the atmosphere is very tense and disturbing. The anti-riot sequence is really exhausting and easily one of the most gruesome moments of the 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his latest role and there is a large (but too modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmare fade that is inevitable for humanity! No spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
