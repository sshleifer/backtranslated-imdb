Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men come to look for ivory and bring Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to bring her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity - a sequel that is better than the original. "Tarzan, the Ape Man" of 1932 was good but had some terrible and dragged special effects. This has VERY better effects and is much more adult. There are tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot point-blank - and nobody really cares) but this was 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (for a 1934 film) and the Uncut prints make Jane take a long swim completely naked! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing almost nothing and (it is implied) they sleep together and have sex - without being married. This would not have bothered anyone today, but in 1934 it was rather extreme. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is well directed, very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion fabric is certainly a pleasure for the eyes and Jane's outfit is also quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane, but Weismuller is as perfect as Tarzan. All others are OK. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan out there. Worth seeing but not for the kids!
