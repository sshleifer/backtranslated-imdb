My daughter, her friends and I have seen this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little friends let it go. Later, I rented it so many times. Never gets old !!! Blockbuster no longer even has its own lists and I tried to buy it, find it, rent it for over 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and is my favorite film of my daughter's childhood ... it has it all! We laughed, we cried, we discussed real life and how difficult some children have it in the world. There was nothing to pretend about this movie. We related to Bill every second and every line! Thank you so much for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Update August '07: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his. It may not be my or your life. It is not only credible, it happens every day. Thanks God! Keep my faith in human nature alive !!! to celebrate!!!!
