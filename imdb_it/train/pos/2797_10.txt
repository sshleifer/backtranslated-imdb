10/10 for this film. <br /> <br /> I am an Indian doctor in India, currently in India. the word Beckham put me off, 'because I'm a Liverpool fan that's hard to die, and personally I think Owen is really strong. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was DEAD sure I wouldn't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had a morning flight, so I thought, "what the hell, let's wait for time watching this movie," "because it was a late night show. < br /> <br /> What an idiot I was. I should have seen this movie the day it was released, I guess using Beckham's name was to attract the public's attraction (which in my case was counter-productive !!! ), but then I really can't think of a better title for the movie. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> < br /> If you hate football, you don't like Manchester United (or England for that matter), then this is DEFINITELY the movie for you, in fact, I'm only 29, a professional psychiatrist, but a child in heart This movie has beaten "Star Wars" from my position number 1. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not many comments on this film by Englishmen like myself. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
