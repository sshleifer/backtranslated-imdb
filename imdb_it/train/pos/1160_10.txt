It is funny. It is not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man, this is fun. Kline and Fields are fantastic. (His demarcation line "God, you are so shameless" as he climbs up his window - fantastic! Kline is running towards the door after discovering Teri Hatcher - very good!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work flawlessly together to find out who he really is ... a turning point in the soap opera if there was one! <br /> <br /> The scene towards the end in the Chinese dining area rolled my children on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rent price. <br /> <br /> It does not solve any global problem or shows the apparent side of daytime TV (I hope). Very funny.
