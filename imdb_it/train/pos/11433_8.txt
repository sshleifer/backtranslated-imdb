Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live action clippings) is almost far from the usual kiddie stuff of anything made by Ralph Bakshi in his heyday . Characters ingeniously conceived as Ralph (a duo of rejected and rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the hilarious villain) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) give life to a unique and intelligent concept: Frivoli vs Murkwood or, the eternal struggle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, the songs infused by MOR on the soundtrack should not have worked, but somehow they do. Is it a pity, then, that I had to look at this through a really ugly-looking boot (selected from a television screening) of the uncensored version ?? there is also a milder variant that attenuates the language for its VHS version ?? since the film is otherwise not available on DVD. It is interesting to note that both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this image in a subordinate way.
