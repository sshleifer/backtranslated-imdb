I still remember seeing him for the first time on TV. I couldn't believe TVNZ did it! I had to own it! Much of the humor will be lost on non-NZ'ers, but try it! <br /> <br /> Finishing the Back of the Y series, Matt and Chris went to bigger and better things (?). New Zealand's greatest ostrich-devil stuntman, Randy Campbell has often appeared in the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, he continues to show off all his stunts because he is too drunk. <br /> <br /> Even the "house band" Deja Voodoo has since released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of the Back of the Y team and singles like "I Would Give You One of My Beers (But I only took 6)" and "You weren't even born in the 80s" their humor continues. <br /> <br /> The South-By-Southwest film festival also presented the feature film 'The Devil Made Me Do It', which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> All up, if you don't find these funny guys, you can only F% ^ K OFF !!
