<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is without doubt the best adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on the screen. Alway, one of my favorite novels, I was delighted with this television series. The late, great Denholm Elliot was interpreted to perfection as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was pure perfection as Laded Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, making small cuts in the plot that do not affect the story. above all a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
