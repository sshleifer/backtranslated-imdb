Overall I was quite impressed by the pilot. The initial fifteen minutes were worrying, as the creators were trying to create a sci-fi version of The OC, but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show enters into themes and situations that I rarely see television plagiarism. <br /> <br /> BSG has dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but they were mainly subtexts, there for the viewer to contemplate or ignore if they so choose. Here, on the other hand, these subjects are at the center of the show and personally I found myself evoking works like Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as points of reference as I watched and I was surprised by the way the themes were discussed. I think if you're a fan of the two I've just mentioned or other movies / TV shows, which cover the subjects I've referred to, I think you'll find at least something here. <br /> <br /> In terms of the starting point to explain how the situation in BSG came about I think they handled it in a very interesting way, I particularly liked how they explained where the Cylon belief came from in one God and the creation of Caprica had enough advanced and contemporary technology launched to make it appear in the future but not completely foreign to us as spectators. <br /> <br /> The only real weaknesses I noticed were the relationship between Greystone's parents and the actress who plays "Lacy Rand". While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point they could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something I think should work. I also found Magda Apanowicz unconvincing in her role. This could be living again and the time needed to develop, but throughout the episode his acting appeared forced and not entirely sure. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot I can't wait to see where "Caprica" ​​enters the future and I hope it touches the magnitude that BSG once did.
