I imagine that every time I see one of these old films from the 80s, I refer you back to a simpler time, no matter how trivial they may seem today. This film is a good movie. I remember seeing him as a child and thinking he was the greatest film ever. It has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Now as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I really know what's going on. I found a strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and make friends with Sissy, get married, move to a trailer, fall, cheat, kill an uncle, then get back together, all in the course of a month? Only in America.
