This is the only movie to see if you are married or a married couple. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with subjects as difficult as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing in the world today is terrible and this film will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> To see. I hope it is distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the cast and director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and a 10-star rating on my part!
