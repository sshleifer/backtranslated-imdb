A wonderful surprise of Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Molla could be such a great director, after all, I don't care much about his choice in movies. However this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable ... something that I always enjoy! It hasn't enjoyed much good press and I don't think it will ever be released in the US market. We'll have to settle for the DVD or the VHS if that too ... I don't want to say much about the story because I don't want to ruin it for you but basically the film is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah only for kicks and to get some money (like many others), before he realizes it he is immersed in a life he didn't count on.
