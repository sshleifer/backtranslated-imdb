One of my favorite films that has been overlooked by too many viewers, an observation that confuses me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee, he had many young actors who would become great protagonists, for example, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, in particular Meyers who portrayed an evil villain he killed for murder. <br /> <br /> When the director's biographies and achievements (even when he won an award for the academy) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the DVD movie by chance and it has become one of my most viewed films. However, it is rarely seen on a cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons why this film is not well known.
