I must admit that when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a 1968 film ?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that it was shot entirely in black and white, I knew my erotic hopes had been dashed. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! Not only does this film have all the elements of a love story - the discovery of first love, the fear of the secret that is discovered, an unexpected sudden end - but sometimes this film was decidedly erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black and white. Cinematography deserves every recognition it has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so I'm both in their mid-twenties trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect the teenagers of the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to come to terms with their sexuality. Anyone looking for real kids here expects too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; however he still managed to leave much to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what was shown to us. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you heterosexual guys who like to watch lesbians in action: even if it's not all you expect, I don't think you'll be too disappointed.
