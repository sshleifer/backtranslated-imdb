Probably the first Portuguese film I saw in my life and I liked it. The plot is linked to how the young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and also to finalize the wars in the colonies, namely Mozambique, Angola and Guinea ( Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers to lead the coup, of oppressed peoples, who were very happy with this new development and freedom, the resistance of Caetano's men , and also a subtle way of conservative officials, including Spinola, who assumed the role of new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain declared that Portugal should develop democratically, and this is what the country has achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected in the end.
