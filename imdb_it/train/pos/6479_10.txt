This is a fantastic series first of all. It is very well made and very interesting. As a big fan of World War II, I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things is that they are all interviews with individuals from the past when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking. It's nothing against the men you see being interviewed in today's programs, it's just that most of these men weren't really involved in the high places of what was happening back then. One of the best parts is the narration of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know about World War II, but I think that only those who die (like me) will want to buy it or watch it more than once. My only complaint about this whole series is that some of the facts are not as precise as we now know. Especially with information about the Soviet Union it is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in places. This information is now different that we now know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall a fascinating look at the Second World War and a must see for any historian of the Second World War professional or personal alike.
