I was really stunned by how much a film, over 60, could impress me. It's almost two hours long, there's absolutely no stars, there are subtitles but it's interesting and exciting to watch. What struck me most was the film's realism. You could almost feel the coldness of the ice, because you can see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI world like our days. I wondered how much work should have been for van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now who wants to talk more about "Titanic"? It is a great film with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic films can be if they are directed only with realism instead of visual effects.
