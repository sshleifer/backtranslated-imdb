Do not listen to the many unripe and ridiculous comments accumulated on this film ... in simple terms, regarding ninja films, this friend of mine is as good as it is! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, yes, the acting and the script are certainly absolutely atrocious, but with chewing gum - it's so damn funny! In fact, as often happens with B-Movies, the horrendous "acting" (which in the case of the film in question is really among the worst I've ever had the joy of seeing!) And the ridiculous "plot" actually only serves to raise the enjoyment level ten times. <br /> <br /> Obviously the fighting scenes are the main attraction in this one though and for the most part I'm happy to say that they are very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we witness the fact that the ninja they are apparently not bound by the normal laws of gravity ...) <br /> <br /> Believe me on this, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you haven't seen Sakura Killers yet, then you're really missing what I think , one of the true jewels of the crown of the genus.
