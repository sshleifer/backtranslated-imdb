Of the 90s Austen film series, this is my favorite, even more than "Persuasion", which was the one that converted me into Austenian. Before seeing this "Emma" I had seen two previous versions, but in one Emma it seemed wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other it seemed wrong, as a possible impostor, while here it seemed right, young and foolish and stubborn. In general I thought that the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the fascination of the novel in an extraordinary way; in fact it is one of the sweetest and sweetest things I've ever seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas gift. The script is unusually well made, and the adapter's additions, like the ray of light that Harriet reveals to Emma in church, are all in harmony. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I liked it very much: it highlights the practical and clear side of the character, in contrast to Emma's affectations, and his outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite amusing . Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of absurdity almost carrollana; Samantha Morton as Emma's protégé is exactly as soft and precise as it should be. And as in the same producers "Pride and Prejudice", care should be taken that any pairings of characters can be believed - in some cases uniquely. For me this production has been and remains a delight.
