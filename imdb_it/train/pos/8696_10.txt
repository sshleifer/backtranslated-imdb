One of the unknown gems of the 80s, Scene ... offers razor sharp satire and extraordinary performances by Arnetia Walker (how did he not get many roles after this?) And Wallace Shawn. It's a delightful passage of class war and the people in those classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters, although not subtle, are blurred. And, sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese guy who extorts one of the other characters as a "band") have not been included as "sociological value", since another review implies they should have been. The value here lies in what the film is making fun of and in the sparkling and bad way it does it. I found it creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
