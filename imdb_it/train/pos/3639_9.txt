This film, for me, is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but for his family. I can't begin to tell you how I could tell my child that Dad was going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and Kansas City Chiefs. He'd think it was the best thing, like Morris's son did. Living dreams with the family is what this is all about. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
