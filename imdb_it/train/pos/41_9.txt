"Who did it?" contains many infallible laughs and gags. It's not just one of Stooges' best films with Shemp, it's one of the best short comedies produced by Columbia. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay for Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard suffered a career shot, he was adapted to the Columbia comedy by Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror".) Obviously it was too good for the Stooges, and at the end of 1947 it was finally filmed by the Stooges. <br /> <br /> Old Goodrich calls investigators ace Shemp, Larry and Moe for fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich is missing, and his niece and many henchmen try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring their niece and beggar to justice? <br /> <br /> Hemp is especially fun in this movie. His reactions after receiving a mickey from Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's cup that looks through the camera lens; and the fight in the dark with all the cast members involved. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges movie. With his hair twisted, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he hadn't towered over everyone else! "Who did it?" is a jewel among Stooges' films with Shemp. Even the die-hard fans will have fun with this! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
