I saw this film last night by cable and it is extraordinary. What I love most is that it is undervalued and low-key, but deeply felt. The performance of Henry Thomas (played as a child in E.T.) is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy criminal. And miraculously (since we're talking about a Hollywood product here) a child serves as the main character, but one who does not act or has lines, but rather only IS (and is bright in this). Interestingly, the mysterious relationship of Thomas w. E. T. it was the heart of that movie; while his tie w. the child is the heart of "A Good Baby". <br /> <br /> Then there's the music - ah, what music !! The songs by Gillian Welch are wonderful and the entire soundtrack is a beautiful hill country music. <br /> <br /> This film is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
