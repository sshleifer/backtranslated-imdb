the photography was beautiful but I had difficulty understanding what was happening ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... the 2 goldfishes - do they mean something in Thai culture? there is not much plot, not much happens and everything is dragged. no real beginning, no real means and no real end. rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get into the characters like you never heard of them ... it was hard to know which scenes were imaginary and which ones were real. The move felt chaotic and disjointed. I don't know what the muddy brothers were hoping for. Maybe if I were Thai it would make more sense ...
