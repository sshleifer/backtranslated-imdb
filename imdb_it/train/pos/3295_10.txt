Such a beauty film that is difficult to describe. Maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogues, or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a joy to see this movie again and again. I have never seen another Indian film approaching it, and few from any country rival its perfection.
