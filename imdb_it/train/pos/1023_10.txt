This show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years. I will miss him very much. Even if Atlantis has filled the hole a little. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on television anyway) was well done. Robert wrote something that seemed close to reality. As if trying to explain what it was like on the show's set. (Everyone works closely for so long they are forced to go up and down, but over the years they have become a family). I thought it was a wonderful way to end up despite someone else's criticism. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special and over and over again led me to overcome incredible incredible thresholds. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. I have been captured since episode 1. The mixture of action, science, drama and above all comedy worked so well that it made me want more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and fun for so many years. It inspired me to do many things that I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the cinema to come next year and I really hope there will be a number of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
