BORN TO BOOGIE is a real "find" - although I have been a rock fan for almost thirty years, I saw the film for the first time a few days ago, and I rank it among the best rock films of all time; the music is fantastic (T. Rex's cream) and the images are always exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer with the desire for more directorial efforts by Ringo Starr, who did a great job here. If you love music, you will be in T. Rextasy for everything, since Marc Bolan is really the star of the piece, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter: different places, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are all used to give different plots and a great deal of optimistic humor to what could have been considered "only" a movie concert in other hands. As rich and full as BORN TO BOOGIE, the film lasts only an hour, but what is there is totally satisfying. Here is my only criticism - the video package says something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims that the film is 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rocking fun.
