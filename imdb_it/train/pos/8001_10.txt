Definitely one of the best films I've seen in a while. A refined direction and impeccable acting make this film very funny and often moving. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and exciting roles to date, and the rest of the cast plays beautifully. Christopher Walken is obviously superb on his part, even if it doesn't appear as often as I would have liked. A story of final greed that fires is counterbalanced by the innocence and love of a child. This is also a movie for action movie lovers as it has a good dose of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feeling of semi-corruption and corruption which in itself is a forerunner. All in all, a truly compelling film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
