"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still like it. There are many episodes that I liked. One of these was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered a moving machine. If you want to know why, you will have to have seen it for yourself. Before concluding, I would like to say that everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even if at the moment you can see new episodes, I highly recommend you to take it in case it goes on air forever.
