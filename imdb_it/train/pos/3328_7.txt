It is rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting in small doses throughout the film (for example, the Big Fat Greek, Me, Myself & Irene marriage). There were only a couple of useless jokes in this film, nothing hopelessly profane. All around, it was a nice movie with cute characters. I thought the ending was a little rough. It seems they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang. The acting left something to be desired, but it was offset by the rhythm of the story. If I had known that it was a Farrelly brothers movie, I would have thought it was a stomach that turned a piece of trash and I didn't look at it, but it seems that they too are capable of randomly making an okay movie. Good for them, I hope they come out and start making good films.
