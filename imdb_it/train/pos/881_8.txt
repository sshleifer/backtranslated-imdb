"Read My Lips" tells of a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple and socially clumsy female employee (Devos) and her workplace apprentice, a rough excon (Casel). As the film refines this unlikely duo to their id, they find themselves caught up in a chilling fusion of minds, each of which uses the other for its own selfish motives with an extraordinary result. Good stuff for anyone in movies based on characters with strong psychodramatic influences. In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
