House of Games is a binding spell. It's so nice to occasionally see movies that are perfect dozens. There are a few movies I've seen that can get you grabbing so fast. From the opening scene this film involves you. <br /> <br /> I'm really trying not to give too much to those who may not have seen this yet, but there will be some SPOILERS SO DON'T READ EVERYTHING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> I would say that House of Games is not just a superb film, but it is the best film about scam artists I've ever seen, except for none. From the moment the film is finished, please be reproduced. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her attitude toward the inflection of her voice that immediately gets into the role. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this film has an unforced quality, almost without a script, and these two people communicate as much as their voices. I also loved the way the film was shot, in that gritty and surreal way, it fits perfectly and helped make the film what it was. <br /> <br /> There were a few films I saw and loved this reminded me to include The Grifters and The usual Suspects, but in reality House of Games is completely different in its way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most engaging characters I've seen on the big screen and not only have a screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the accumulation that starts from the moment they set their eyes on each another is electrifying. You know something will happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the "something" is, you realize that you haven't even scratched the surface .... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those movies that could be set aside in a a certain kind of film, but it is essentially a film about human nature. The character study is not just about the fraudster's mind, but also about the victim. As the film progresses and we know more and more about the main characters, we learn to know them not only through what they say, but how they say it. It is a great study of the character and is impeccable in the way it accelerates to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> In closing, I would classify 10 out of 10, calling it (even if it is not my absolute favorite movie, rather high on the list), definitely exceptional and would go so far as to say that it ranks as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" I've ever seen. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to films of the human psyche, in reality it doesn't go much better than this. See this movie.
