It could have been better if it had been directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin didn't do a bad job, but it's not a great film work. <br /> <br /> It is, however, a beautiful film. I loved it because the local channels used it to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some rather bad films have been made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol" but I'm not one of them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" once many years ago and I liked it but maybe I'm just fondly thinking about the novel.) This is superbly launched. Charles Boyer no, it is true, he runs into Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - tired, wary, caring. Lauren Bacall is as attractive as the English girl who falls in love with him. But the support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. His performance is a bit Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time when he gives Boyer a lesson in a universal language similar to an Esperanto, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the toughest heart. It appears as an early precocious teenager. The character wants to be useful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The reservation is, mainly, which is a bit stolid. But history and acting cannot be improved.
