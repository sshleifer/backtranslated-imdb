This film is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is atrocious. The special effects are asinine and the whole film is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Still, it is by far the most entertaining movie ever given permission to be produced. There are only 101 minutes of laughter, because we all know that there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or in any El Camino. There are also other aspects that I will not ruin, just because they are what make films so wonderfully moral. I highly recommend this film, only for its total idiocy. I have no idea who would look at this aspect expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, look at the 3,000 Year Enders!
