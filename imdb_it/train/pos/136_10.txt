This film is a great way to finally end the series. Peter (the Puppet Master III boy) grew up and is now the puppeteer. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead hears the story of the puppets. Most of this film is filmed by Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, The Puppet Master's Curse and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... but I guess Paramount doesn't allow them to use scenes of 1 ). I personally want Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys would have finally been made, but the way this film ends in practice says "This is the final film of the series ..."
