Funny movie I saw this movie in 2002 at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival, and I laughed from start to finish. The acting was subtle but very funny. I'm not entirely sure about the influence of "The Real World", we don't get it here, but the film resists without understanding that show. Heather B steals every scene she appears in, especially when she plays with her rarely talkative red co-star. Highly recommended. I'd like to see it published on Video / DVD in the future.
