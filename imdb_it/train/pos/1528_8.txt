I'm a writer who works at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunch break companion - good fun, good humor, good humor and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show. How innocent we were (and how innocent Diagnosis Murder is). I particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgic figures like Joe Mannix. The bad guys are always caught, the good guys continue. The stars clearly enjoy themselves and are making a ball without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> A beef: why were there so many bad women or at least females? Amanda was too stunned. It's hard to imagine her doing something as gruesome as an autopsy. I hope we haven't seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, esp. at lunch !!
