World At War is perhaps the largest documentary series of all time. Historical research is practically flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary on the Second World War. A priceless historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures of the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
