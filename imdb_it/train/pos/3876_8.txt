The beautiful Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from everyone's nose, it is no small feat considering the extraordinary performances that surround her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, an unemployed, independent, somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who arrives at a desperate job in search of a deceitful and wheelchair-bound father, Walentin great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died 77 years after the making of this film). <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - until he confronts the talented Anna, whose whimsical and mischievous way brings back the poor old damn devil from a self-imposed death sentence. /> <br /> The writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty of a well thought out businessman (Jorgen, played by Clausen) who loves a father who never accepted it. The film gives way towards the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how a person, the irrepressible Anna, can alter the course of a human life . Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
