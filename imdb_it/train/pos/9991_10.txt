I thought this movie was hysterical. I have watched it many times and highly recommend it. Mel Brooks was excellent. The cast was fantastic .. I don't understand how this film has a score of 2 out of 5. I loved it .. I saw his other films and they were fun too, but this has remained in my mind because of humor .. I can't say enough about this movie. I look for it periodically, but it's never enough for me. The people who played the homeless were also compared to the funniest standards. Please put this movie more often. I can't see it enough ... Even Llie Ann Warren was one of my favorites, since Cinderella. I always thought it wasn't very funny but loved his acting. It was a lot of fun in this film ... and she and Mel did a great job together. They should put more of his movies on TV.
