I've seen this movie twice and I think it's good enough for the limited equipment used to create this film. (filmed in 1947) The dott. Heyerdahl explains his theory on the migration of South American pre-Colubian Indians to the islands of Polynesia, through the fall of large balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and the crew as they select balsa trees in Equidor and float with them along the river to the Pacific for the assembly in Peru. They launch in a 101-day marine adventure by testing the strength of their primitive raft that survived only with the means available to the natives of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
