A Bugs Life is a great film that is not only for children but also for adults. The story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the wicked locusts that come back every year and steal their food (a mirror of the magnifying seven). There is a wonderful computer animation and the voices are also fantastic. You will love it!! 8 out of 10
