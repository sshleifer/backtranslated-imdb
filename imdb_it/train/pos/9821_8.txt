I saw this movie on True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical) but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the surprising plot weave or breathtaking dialogues (of which there is little), but because in reality, despite what people say, I thought the film was accurate in the description of teenagers who deal with pregnancy. <br /> <br /> It is NOT Dawson's Creek, they are not cute, funny witty characters who move through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and behave like children would. <br /> <br /> They are outspoken, clumsy and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes, it could be a case and they could just be bad actors, but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when he's not trying to be cool) a very believable performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette Is she whiny and annoying, but was she pregnant and a little girl? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable, but so what? I believed them, his stress and his inability to cope with his courageous but slightly misguided attempts to approach them. I think the characters, played by anyone else, would have been really boring and unbelievable, but they weren't. It reflects the surreality of the situation in which they find themselves, who is sitting in the classroom and walking on campus with the child. I felt angry with her for this, I felt angry with him for being a child and blaming her. I've heard everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, I loved it and would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the scene in which Dermot Mulroney starts from the disastrous counseling session - career performance.
