"Birth of the Beatles", for being an American television film, published in the autumn of 1979, has been, so far, the best film that tells the story of the four boys of Liverpool who have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As said from the point of view of the former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the entire cast is excellent, but above all the interpretation of Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr Dick Clark. Who a year earlier in 1978 had produced another TV movie, this one has stood the test of time starring "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role of another musical legend; "ELVIS". The film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter" who directed other successful films like; "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said for the director of the "Birth of the Beatles", Mr Richard Marquand. He continued to direct other theatrical successes such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other film that tells the story of the Fab Four I know, is Back Beat who had a film release in 1994. However, critics didn't worry about it, or the public, because it didn't have a long life span in the theater. The birth of the Beatles is a very fascinating and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the difficulties and difficulties they have experienced and end at the height of success when they arrive in New York and appear on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 I highly recommend this film.
