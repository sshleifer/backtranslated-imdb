I used this film in a religion class I was teaching. The gold fish happily swims in its bowl in an upstairs apartment. A boy and his mother are away from home. The boy was given the money to buy milk. On the way home, he stops at the carnival to play a game. Next to him is a man in black overalls who looks a little scary. The boy drops the milk bottle. Breaks. The man in the black suit gives him the money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what happens at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Discovers the fish bowl and looks at it. The fish swims energetically and flies out of the bowl. By now, a group of teenagers in my class and I fell in love with fish. The cat takes the fish in its mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. The double plot includes the suspicious black man and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudices. Both are innocent. It was a great beginning of discussion in my class.
