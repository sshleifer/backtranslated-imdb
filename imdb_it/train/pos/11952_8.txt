Scoop *** from **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I liked "Match Point". It was an excellent romantic and dark thriller that fortunately did not play Woody Allen. There was the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and even if it appears in this, it's fine. Also presents Scarlett Johansson and the two work perfectly together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young university journalist who gets the scoop of a life from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while he was on a boat with the gruesome reaper and a pile of other souls that the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman). He tells Joe that Peter could be the serial killer who walks the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a lifetime, returns to life and gives this information to Sondra, during a magical act. Sondra is in some magic show with the magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). Become a volunteer to go into a box that disappears and while it's in the box, receives Joe's visit. Not knowing what to do, he helps Sid Waterman to help her solve the case. <br /> <br /> This film has a pleasant feeling of lightness compared to "Match Point" and yet everything works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits perfectly for this story and this role. Hugh Jackman is as exceptional as Peter Layman, the "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little movie to see if you're looking for someone to watch. The ensemble cast works well together and the story flows and sometimes you forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you might like it.
