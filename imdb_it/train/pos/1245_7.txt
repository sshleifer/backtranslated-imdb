Every time I see most of the reviews it's called "a bonfire for Eddie Murphy". These critics want to take a look at some of the things he is doing these days, and perhaps soften their position in retrospect ... "The Golden Child" is not intellectual entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast you can breathe new life into old cliché and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I don't understand the pervasive lack of "love" for his efforts, at all. Perhaps he was released at a time when the establishment had grown tired of thrilling and thrilling adventures in a minute? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it is unfair to make this a scapegoat when what is perhaps its greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to exploit trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is silly, but even a casual observer should be able to understand that "ridiculous" is the beginning and the end of the Hollywood idea of ​​mysticism. What is more important than credibility with a story like this is that the public has tourist guides at their disposal to show them the mysterious things. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy adapt perfectly to this ability. My advice is to buy the ticket and go around.
