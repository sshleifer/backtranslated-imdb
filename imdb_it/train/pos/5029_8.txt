I went to this movie maybe a little tired from the hacking and slashing movies on the screen these days. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly characterized by a dark and dark atmosphere. Even more surprising was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. As with most good movies, this leaves something to the imagination and Bill Paxton did a great job as a director. Scenes shot inside the car as they are well done and, after seeing the "Anatomy of a scene" episode at the end of the videotape, it was nice to see that some of the subtle but wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just a kind of direction "Oh, that looks nice, keep it". This is a moody film, full of sadness. However, for the obscure subject, a considerable part of it is filmed in the light of day, even some of the most disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (Ok, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and I never exaggerate. Au Contraire, it is very subdued that works very well for this type of film. If there is an area in which this film is missing, it is in the final, which seems a bit too contrived, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the film. What is the message? It is something that each individual decides for himself. Overall, on the 1-10 scale, this film marks an 8 for those who love the southern Gothic genre (eg "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the garden of good and evil"), and about a 5 for those who wear ' t.
