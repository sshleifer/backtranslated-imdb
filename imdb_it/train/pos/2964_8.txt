BASEketball is an extremely fun film that offers acting that generally makes the film much more fun, comic material that is more than disgusting in trousers, and a pretty good plot, despite the fact that it is the classic slacker against the evil rich. and the only thing I didn't like about BASEketball, is that that child wasn't really necessary in the film, but if the child wasn't in the movie, some of the funny scenes wouldn't have existed. If you have read any professional reviews on this film, exclude them all because basically all reviewers don't like this movie. BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
