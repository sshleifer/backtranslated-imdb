saying this, I want to say that this is not a well made film, but it is a very good version of the real event and the best performance so far. And if you are a WW2 fan, this is a pleasure for you, because there are three out of four sabotage members who play roles in this movie. It is theatrical acting at best, but then this is still as said before a semi-final. <br /> <br /> Personally I am a huge fan of our almost human heroes of World War II, and there should be hundreds of these films showing us what they have done so that it is not forgotten by future generations. Because nowadays children don't read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> So, if you want an extravaganza action, rent Private Ryan, this is the truth about persistent pain, outrageous resistance and the will to fight when everything seems lost.
