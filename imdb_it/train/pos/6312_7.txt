Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", they starred together in this film. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In the potential this also looks like a beautiful and fun project, which is in the same line as movie remakes like "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this film is only halved successfully, or at least it's not as good could have been. <br /> <br /> The film its characters are all played by some well-known actors but a pity is that the characters don't really have enough space to develop. Even if in their potential they could have turned into fun and funny characters, now they are just characters that lightly entertain most of the most extravagant sequences in the film. The fact that they are played doesn't change much, even if they keep their characters from becoming boring or maybe even boring, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Obviously because of the writing that the characters are not used for their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this film. The film is based too much on its simple story and on the predictable way of narration. <br /> <br /> However, the film is simply still a lot of fun to watch, perhaps for the same simplicity. It is a harmless film of capers, in which you shouldn't worry much about the story. In this regard, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a film that works and serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> It's a film you won't regret watching once it's finished, but it's also a movie that you can really do without ever having seen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
