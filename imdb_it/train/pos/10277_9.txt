This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas would have been repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly. This really concerns the failure of trust, of the human condition. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, nobody is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this show in our society, every single day? The film is very structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Except that there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone participates in the con. Could it all be more true? <br /> <br /> Don't miss the soundtrack. It's wonderful.
