That's how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in replicas in 2001. <br /> <br /> I like the show but it has had too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I HATE THE MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> Stealing storylines from old TV shows. They even stole "The Partirdge Family". So in 1 episode "The Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn is the most remarkable thing, especially when she performed in an episode. <br /> <br /> The character of Michelle CANNOT take a joke, but then they did recite this little "revenge" to her sisters for a joke from them about her. <br /> <br /> Stories that came and went in 1 episode. Joey is receiving the television program with Frankie and Annette, never to be heard again later. Danny suddenly plays the guitar. 1 episode that is training soccer, 1 episode that is training softball / baseball. 1 game and you're out eh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse and Joey continue to get jobs REALLY QUICKLY without experience. Only in a television program. <br /> <br /> I liked the D.J. And characters from Stephanie. I wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure and have a life as a non-drug addict.
