This is one of the first "Pilot" films for the famous Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. Some network executives were played before Showcase decided to sign up for a TV series. Great acting and a very entertaining cast make this one of the best cult comic films. The plot of the film is that these two little criminals of the time run "exterminating" pets for money. If you have a dog next to you that is barking all night, these are the guys you go! But they get in trouble when they meet a job that is too big to face and they end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> Vote R for oath, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's not even too offensive (actually they don't show killing animals)
