I was entranced by this moving and fun movie, not to mention being surprised. I was also surprised to find that Paulie's voice was played by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, that neither of them hesitated with Schmaltz, nor was it becoming too harsh under the bravado of New Jersey, which I thought should have been an old unsung pro, not Mr. Mohr's childish face. A truly impressive performance, indeed, and it is gratifying to see his talents taken seriously in a series of bizarre indie films.
