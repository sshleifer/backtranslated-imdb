The second of the Why We Fight Series focuses on taking Hitler of the Sudetanland and beyond, while taking a picture of Neville Chamberlain and embarking on his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly understood as a propaganda in its time this series beyond the test of time has become an informative documentary and even most of the "allied prejudices" have proved to be historical facts. The Fuhrer rises on his firecracker with complacent statements in front of his people and the world as he says one thing and does another while his army moves eastward. The Czechs and the Austrians quickly capitulate but the Poles have faced a heroic fight against overwhelming opponents. <br /> <br /> The disparity between the military power of Hitler and Chamberlain that waves the treaty of Monaco like a white flag, declaring that "peace in our time" today has lasting propaganda qualities. Here in its original context it resonates even more powerful as the darkness of the Second World War begins on Europe leaving the American spectator with two options, freedom or slavery. In 1943 there was no way to evade this simple truth and The Nazis Strike makes his point effective.
