I was very touched by the story and because I'm going through something similar with my parents, I'm really connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they have made and with which they have to live together. I loved Ellen Burstyn's performance and who is Christine Horne? Is fantastic! A real discovery. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, yet nothing has been shown - it was done so beautifully. Overall the graphic aspect of the film was amazing, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good at this image, humanizing a man who is spiraling downward. I liked the way the director approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to attract us, but not enough to get bogged down.
