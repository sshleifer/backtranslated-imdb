This film has scenes that come back to me in the weirdest moments - that intense scene with Mr. Muckerji telling Mrs. Melandez that someone he spoke to testifies that the girl was pushed out the window by a woman who fits her description --- it is one that goes around - the way she keeps calling herself by name --- with a Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and then when Boyer finds out that she has just taken poison and gives her one last hit on the side of the head before she dies --- it's a delight! "Fools - Fools - my whole life" ... etc. Etc. - get the point ... I have to buy this. I love the acting of Dan Seymour - he usually plays a plump foreign sultan or police chief and has appeared in Casablanca and many beautiful photos.
