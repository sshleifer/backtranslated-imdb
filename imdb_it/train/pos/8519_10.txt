Surprising ..... This could have been a miserable attempt to redo the already re-created Omen movie, but I certainly liked it. <br /> <br /> The last man who commented is a fool, this film was a very kind one, and The Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith Himself, would have applauded this movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent advice from me to see or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror films and soundtracks So listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not appeal to me, the endings. <br /> <br /> According to Prophecy it is all inaccurate, including the final conflict and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is ... There are great films ... and they should be seen, before the Great Depression falls upon us, and before the Democrats Take the presidency too. <br /> <br /> So signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer with a brain.
