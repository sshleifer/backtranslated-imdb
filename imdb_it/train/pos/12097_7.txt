This complicated story begins quite simply, with an English journalist accepting a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood who can't spend a night in Blackwood's haunted castle. Once there, the writer wanders through the dusty rooms and corridors, until the music and the look of a pair of waltzes take him to an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and starts playing the tune he has heard, and is surprised to be touched on the shoulder by the astonishingly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him in an ambiguous, fascinating and mysterious way, that she has prepared her room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night ... the Night of the Dead. Thus begins a surprising series of supernatural events that baffle the journalist for the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: it probably won't surprise too many viewers to know that the adorable Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but makes things more complicated for them than for the average couple. This is a funny film, with absolutely everything: ghosts, spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (although both have been toned down in the version that most Americans have seen over the years.) The seductive and captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. He has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in movies. Recommended!
