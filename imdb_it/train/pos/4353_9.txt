We are so lucky to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Entering the theater we were given a small opinion that would have been used for the personal evaluation of the film. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think you can judge as superb? Only about 5 for me." But then watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching the spectacular scenery set in the New York state film, I slowly started to film the film on one category at a time. Certainly it was nice but the totally natural repertoire of the actors and an award-winning performance by a man who will probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing a detective rather than this film, the film has jumped to the excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there were a few dry eyes in the house and my usual stoic and callous heart melted just like those of the Grinch and in the end I gave a superb result. <br /> <br /> This photo is a must for anyone with parents No violence or nudity but strong language.
