I had seen the fragments of this as a child but, while I was buying the Blue Underground set immediately because it was a limited edition, only now I put it into my viewing program - and it's mainly because Bakshi's American POP (1981) it just popped up in late night Italian TV (see my review of that movie below)! <br /> <br /> However, I found the film to be a pretty good sword and sorcery epic with particularly impressive backgrounds (the rather rare characters in rotoscoped were, I am, less so) with a derivative if derivative Punto. The plot, once again, wasn't exactly original, but it proved undeniably engaging in a youthful level and the main characters developed enough - particularly interesting is the evil ice lord Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf; the hero and the heroine, however, are rather insignificant stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta paint the girl so well endowed (her bra could be torn off every second) and half naked to boot (the her little panties are forever disappearing in the ass)! Still, it's clearly an action-oriented piece and certainly has an important role (involving Darkwolf being particularly wild); the final showdown, even if short, is also well managed and sees our heroes riding pterodactyls attacking the den of criminals inside a cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, apart from the Frazetta summits, the main appeal of this film for me now is its nostalgia factor that brought me back to my childhood days watching not only movies like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982) but also animated TV series like BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS DELL'UNIVERSO (1983-85). <br /> <br /> Concerning the accompaniment THE MAKING OF "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> Vintage featurette on the animated film sword-and-sorcery that is available only through the faded VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! Follows some details on the rotoscope technique and also shows several examples of live-action "performances" (in a studio) of segments of the script - which would then be plotted, mixed with the backgrounds and movies. However, after witnessing several delights behind the scenes on the art of animation (on the sets of Disney Tins and Looney Tunes, for example), it is not a very compelling piece ...
