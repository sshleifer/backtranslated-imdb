The Dinner Party could, in my opinion, be the greatest film production for adults of all time. It is produced so exquisitely and the actors play their roles excellently. The kitchen scene with Yvonne and Juli Ashton is magnificent. The use of butter and milk really makes the scene. Furthermore, the doctor's surgery scene is well done. The bonfire scene is full of pleasant action, even if the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera's performance in the landfill scene is incredible, but who would expect anything less from her. The final scene is a bit too used in adult movies, but it's still classic. I highly recommend this movie to all movie fans for adults and casual viewers. Exit your video store and get it today.
