As the first of the TV specials offered in the elaborate box set, "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials", released last November, this record is distributed separately for those who do not want to shell out the dollars for all five special offers. As an investment, this is really the best of the group, if only for the fact that it is Streisand in its purest and most eager to impress appearance. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Signed for a long-term contract with CBS to produce one-hour variety shows, an almost extinct format nowadays, Streisand was 22 in this first special CBS show in April 1965. At that point in the his career, his notoriety was limited to a handful of hit albums, some dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows, and his successful Broadway series in "Funny Girl". <br /> <br /> Shot in sharp black and white, the program is divided into three distinct parts. With the transient creative use of "I'm Late" by Disney "Alice in Wonderland", the first segment skillfully shows its growth from childhood through different numbers like "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". Opening with a comic monologue on Pearl in Istanbul, the second part moves to Manhattan's elegant Bergman Goodman, where he is elegantly dressed in a series of glamorous dresses while singing songs from the Depression era such as "I've Got Plenty of Nuthin "and" The best things in life are free "with comic irony. Returning to the origins, the third segment is a direct concert that opens with a torch version of "When the Sun Comes Out", includes a medley "Funny Girl" and ends with his classic, melancholy interpretation of "Happy Days Are Here" Again "on the final titles. Also included is the brief introduction he recorded in 1986, when the special was first published on VHS. For those who know Streisand only for his tickets for the most expensive concerts and for the collection of political funds, this is a real glance on why it is so revered now.
