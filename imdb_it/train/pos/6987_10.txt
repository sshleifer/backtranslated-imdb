Setting aside the UFO "thing". This was the best documentary I've ever seen. Factual reports from Neil and Buzz ... a must see. The interviews and reports are a revelation since most of the information was recorded confidential in 1969 and published only in 2006. No documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for these short 47 minutes ... THE FACT it will leave you speechless, and you will be amazed at the risks assumed to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Have you ever seen a man save his life? Bet no. Neil saves life when only the second of a thousandth separated him from death. Incredible to watch. It is a farce the people did not know all the details assumed with the landing on the moon and the courage that those men had before certain death, from a failed computer ... 10 stars!
