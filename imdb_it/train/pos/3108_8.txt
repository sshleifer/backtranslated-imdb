This episode makes the CIA a very foolish association. Actually, maybe I am. After all, the way the plot goes on, it looks like a man has the power to punish and kill everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the whole movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He gets help from a couple of people and it seems like every minute of the movie, someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time to rest in this film and the action sequences seem very real. There are a lot of sequences of chases filmed with the shaky cam that in a sense add realism and make Hollywood look less like many images. These sequences add realism to the film in feelings. <br /> <br /> The suspense in some sequences is brilliantly made as you wonder if someone will die or if Bourne will be able to challenge him. This is the kind of action you feel when you want to be entertained and I'm sure this will lead to the next movie in the series.
