- SMALL SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I saw the "Creep" votes today, I was surprised by so many IMDb users who voted for this movie "1". I wonder: what do people expect from this type of film? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR film and is quite good! This means automatically: it has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous risks and simple one-sided characters. So why complain? Grab some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your place and then ... ... have fun being scared to death! The first 60 minutes of almost nothing but Kate and a solitary subway station are incredibly scared. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will only give jerks because of a sudden sound of a flashing neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this film.) When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the movie drops but it doesn't become a bad movie. The second part of the film is not at all scary, but the effects of blood are well made and the plot is quite well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that it's a horror movie you're watching and not the Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to get yourself a very, very scary hour. Watch the first hour of "Creep" and then exit the cinema or your TV. You still know the rest of the story, don't you? The wicked one will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie until the end, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the dark night cinema, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
