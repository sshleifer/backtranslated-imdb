A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a wonderful film that I can watch over and over again. It is certainly one of the first ten comedies made. With an exceptional cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have written a perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his play. <br /> <br /> It is a real situation for a perfectly executed life. If you have digital cable, you get the menu at the bottom of the screen to give what is active. It usually gives this film ***% stars but actually deserves **** stars. If you really watch this movie, one can say that it will be fun and fresh in a hundred years.
