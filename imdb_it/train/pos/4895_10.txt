It is rare that I sit in front of the TV specifically to watch a particular program. It's even rarer when I finally enjoy the program, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm and an excellent, witty and moving script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can't really express how beautiful it seemed to me, so I won't try, I'll just say, if you have the opportunity, PLEASE SEE IT !!!! I just hope it comes out on video.
