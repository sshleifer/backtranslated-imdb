I had the opportunity to watch this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, in which it won an award for best film. This film is brilliant, with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were by Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, which I was surprised to find that this film was made on a limited budget. Screenwriter and director Adam Jones, who I think has also won an award for his screenplay, does a great job with directing. The public loved this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh for the whole movie. A must see.
