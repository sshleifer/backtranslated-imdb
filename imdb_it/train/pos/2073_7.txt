In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous speed trap city. Much of the revenue was generated by the sheriff's department that captures speeders. Those who tried to outrun the sheriff? Well, that gave the sheriff the chance to push them off the Clarksberg curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, a couple of retired soldiers trying to get back to the base in time are driven to death, if I remember correctly. Then one day, a stranger drove into the city. Perhaps the hottest rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a machine name, as in McCord's gaskets. In possibly the last hot rod. A black '34 blaze Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hell. It is picked up for speed by the sheriff on purpose. Check the location of the terrain. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way to get justice for the killing of his brother and to fix things so that "this will never happen to anyone": recreate the chase and settle the hot-rodder style of the competition to the end . Go out to the curve and practice. The sheriff knows that McCord knows. The race begins ... This is a film that must be remembered by anyone who has ever tried to master maneuvers on a certain stretch of road.
