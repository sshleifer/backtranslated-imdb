Preminger's beautiful film; labyrinthine, at times, as it explores sets and places from various angles and perspectives as if it were a natural film about the inhabitants of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is satisfying from the visual and spatial point of view, since its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, enters the boiling water when he accidentally kills a boy with a plate on his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays like Hamlet, and has never been better. History can be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives weight and almost elevates it to the level of tragedy. As his girlfriend, Gene Tierney is attractive but insignificant. Gary Merrill is a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth that creates a pleasant contrast to Andrews' coldness; his smiling, apparently bad boy seems to continually challenge his nemesis just because he is emotionally open, unlike the injured and moralist policeman who is pursuing him. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this film, which seems transitory for all concerned. For director Preminger it is a sort of reunion with his stars of Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks during the time the film was made. The supporting cast, - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are understandably more optimistic as they were getting on. Preminger, a serene observer as always, lets events take place without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, because the game between cat and mouse between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any film could contain, much less resolution. <br /> <br />
