This film is the first cinematic experience of many people in the cast. All of them are expert actors and have played in various TV series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It is rather strange to see him in a thriller, while he is at the peak of his career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot by Togan Gokbakar and practically the first experience as a director. But they did a good job. We are happy to see such an enthusiastic and young cast. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay is a longtime girlfriend of Sahan Gokbakar, she is also a talented actress, who is known for her recent work in the drama "number 27" and in several TV series.
