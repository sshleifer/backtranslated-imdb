There is a certain genius behind this film. I was laughing all over. The scene in the phone sex office, which talks about how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius / humor. Execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and have some talent. The doppelganger breakup at the end was like ... "ok, I didn't expect that, but let's see what the movie has to say". Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very consistent with the story in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Is the point of a film logical or is it funny or communicative on an emotional level? I'm easily bored by many movies, but this has kept my interest in everything. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have self-biographical roots, but it's just a hypothesis. Bad terribly, but good. I'm looking for other movies that this person might have done (with more experience).
