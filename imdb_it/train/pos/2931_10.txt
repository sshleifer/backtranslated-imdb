Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw it about 2 years ago, I was at points for weeks afterwards. Until today I have seen it another 17 times and I keep laughing my ass every time. For those who don't know that Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedian before becoming a Hollywood superstar. There is no boring point in this piece of genius unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987, which becomes flat during the medium. If you are not the type of person who cannot bear to swear, I would not advise you to see it because you will probably hear some form of swearing every 5-10 seconds. I gave this 10 out of 10 because it shows the greatest comic genius of all at its best.
