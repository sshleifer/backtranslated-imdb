This is an interesting little film made in 1967, with a high-impact jazz music and a plot that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun to go crazy. I have seen many similarities between this and "Creature with the blue hand" (AKA The Bloody Dead) and have the same director! The best of Scotland Yard is to investigate the murders of young women in college. It seems that the criminals are released from a local prison to make the offerings of some evil person and then returned when their work is finished. There is an elegant device hidden inside a prussic acid splashing bible, and there is another device that is neither elegant nor clandestine, it looks like a big water gun and the victim must be very close soaked before it expires . Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and mostly chews gum and looks away. There is a "monk", and as someone identifies this as a "monk" is beyond me, he wears a whip and dresses in a red dress with a red hood, plus a Klan member of a different color than a monk . There are all kinds of elegant devices like a chimney that goes up and down to admit the monk, and walks straight into the fire without lighting his robe, an elegant trick right there. This is a strange combo of dramatic crime with funny nuances, and while it's rather silly, it's sometimes fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
