John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best film I've seen in a while. It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a similar use of Warhol color, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker gets bigger than his city can handle, and is separated from his loved ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his lover artistic director. The image left a refreshing taste in my mouth - a bit like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it made the whole thing more profound and critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to bear arms ... and all that this country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
