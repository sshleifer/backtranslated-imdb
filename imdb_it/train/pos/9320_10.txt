A MGM MINIATURE short film. <br /> <br /> The publisher of the Cole County Clarion must decide what the real IMPORTANT NEWS are for his readers: an imminent chill that can mean disaster for their crops, or sensational killing. of a notorious gangster in their small main street. <br /> <br /> It is a small funny newt, with a good interpretation of the comic Charles "Chic" Sale. Today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of James Stewart, who is not accredited, like Sale's nephew / assistant. Speaking slowly and a bit silly, Stewart shows many of the features that would make him a big star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, the subjects with one and two wheels were useful for the Studios as important training grounds for new or growing talents, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamic for creating a short, successful subject was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a first-class story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and planning and capable of representing a wide range of materials, the short subjects were the perfect complement to the films of the Studios.
