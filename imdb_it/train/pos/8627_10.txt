My God ! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best films I've ever seen. Closer to Peter Greenaway and the films of Jean-Luc Godard, this is really scary but not macabre like the Nekromantik. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest and the direction is totally inventive, despite the lack of money (see the "bridge" sketch). Highly recommended!
