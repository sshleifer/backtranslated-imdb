This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know it, I saved a lot of you time to read this review. If you don't like Arnold, then you won't like this movie. If the case is the other one, you'll probably like it a lot. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're still reading I expect you to like Arnold. Good for you! He's pretty good, he's not. The Running Man is a very typical characteristic of Arnold. He has the usual retrospective that we know very well from the 1980s of B-Sci Fi, he has a lot of terrible jokes, a lot of violence and explosions, and a heroine of good looks and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, the evil opponent is the 1984 controlling government, which controls television as an effective crowd control with gladiator-type shows. Arnold obviously ends up in one of these shows and turns everything upside down, with a little help from his two confederates and good-looking amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big movie budget, but it still managed to create a nice atmosphere of the future, with some nice paintings and opaque sets to help it. It is hopelessly 80s, but I find it fascinating. The acting is variable, Arnold makes his usual grunt and shouts, with the help of stone beats. Heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a little stereotyped, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV personality. <br /> <br /> Despite all its flaws, the film shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also features futuristic digital video editing, which allows villains to change their face in a video to deceive the public. This doesn't seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold's films before, then you know when to watch this. To enjoy.
