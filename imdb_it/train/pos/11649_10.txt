What an absolutely incredible film, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, look at it, you won't regret it, it's too funny! Rajnikanth carries the film on his shoulders and even if there is nothing more different from him, I still liked it. A. Rehman's music takes time to grow on you, but after listening to it a couple of times, you really started to like it.
