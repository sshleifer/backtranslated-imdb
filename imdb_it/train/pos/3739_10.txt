I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool, non-intimidated soldier who doesn't want to go to war. His character is similar to that of Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, is not set in a war zone, but in pre-war combat preparation training. This wonderful film tells the nauseating awareness that the Vietnam War was a mistake and those men who were deemed sacrificed for a lost cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is as brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who showed very sincere love and compassion for his fellow soldier, as he did with disdain and irreverence for the establishment he was trying to kill him. Bozz is totally cool and not contested, testing and perfecting his military superiors, getting their goat on every occasion. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree in psychology, "saving" his comrades and showing those in genuine need, the way out of this man's army. <br /> <br /> Acting and action is clear, credible and like "Sleeper", Tigerland abandons Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the first three Vietnamese films in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, an excellent choice.
