I remember appreciating him more than Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds in an age when that tone of history was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have influenced his release in the United States, to avoid confusion with his vast Hispanic audience, has the talent as a cartoonist in the debut production of director Conan. Indeed, Pazu has the thick bones and the immortal vitality of Conan - who jumped down from a thousand stories carrying his girlfriend in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. This makes him the most animated and enjoyable character to watch. Nausica techie enthusiasts can be disappointed with flying insects and retro technology through Laputa - the only exception might be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, Laputa's theme is not directly related to environmentalism. If it has a theme it is anti-war. The importance of living naturally - this is connected to the flying castle, it is arguably briefly discussed, and not really followed. Overall, I now consider the piece as a cross between feeling good and mushy.
