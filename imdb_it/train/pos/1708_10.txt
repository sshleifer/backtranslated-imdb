Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to ask yourself what some people do for fun .... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see the film during its too short theatrical run. The audience laughed out loud. I'm looking at a tape while I'm writing and it's still fun! <br /> <br /> It also has a sweet side, with unexpected turns of authentic pathos. The late, great Royal Dano is particularly effective as the lonely and unfortunate peasant Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is as fantastic as the main boys. And the actors in the Martian seeds, even if limited to mimicry, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is the details of the background. The film is full of tributes, pastiche and references to other science fiction and fantasy films. Check out the Martian costumes next time. One of them is wearing a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is wearing an Atreides uniform and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flight suit.
