Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Simple as that, and he succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful film, especially visually. He knows how to use pots, slow motion sequences, tracking shots, crane blows, etc. Beautifully and linearly. This gives the film a very relaxing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party in which everyone participates, which is also the turning point of this film. The beauty of this image does not lie in the question of how the characters affect them (compared to a similar film, obviously better than Magnolia). I simply don't think it was Barman's idea. Beauty lies in the different details of the experiences that go through the people who make or break their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe small experiences. He knows the people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> Even the soundtrack of the film is excellent, but not a surprise, since we know that Barman is also a successful singer-songwriter and musician with his dEUS group. Music is sometimes warm and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the luminous and sunny sensation of the film. Other times we listen to funky / rock-melody pops that give some scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one flaw, and this is the last half hour. Was it the runtime that was destroying me? Or weren't they the freshest and most accurate scenes of the scenes so far? I can't understand it ... <br /> <br /> All in all a beautiful sunny film that raises Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> (It is the breeze that flows through the hair of a girl on a sunny afternoon that makes it even more beautiful, it is the cool breeze that makes you relax when you go to a crowded party when someone opens the door: it's the breeze that carries the scent of that pretty girl sitting next to you in the park you just met a week ago, it's the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
