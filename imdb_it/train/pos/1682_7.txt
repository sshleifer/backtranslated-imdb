After dipping his toes in the yellow pool with the masterly film "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed the same year with what turns out to be another suspense thriller, "The Case of the Scorpion's Coda." Like his previous commitment, this is played by George Hilton, the handsome macho man, who would continue to star in Martino's Satanic / yellow hybrid "All the Colors of the Dark" the following year. "Scorpion's Tail" also hosts the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who will play an unhappy couple (to put it simply!) In "Your vice is a closed room and only I have the key" (1972) by Martino. (I love that title!) I guess Edwige Fenech was busy in the month they shot this movie! However, this film boasts the stylistic direction that Martino's fans would expect, as well as a tortuous plot, some pieces of finely made murders, and beautiful shots of the Athenian setting. The story this time concerns an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here she looks like the prettier and smarter sister of Farrah Fawcett) who gets involved in a series of gruesome murders following a plane crash and the legacy of $ 1 million from a beautiful widow. I really thought I had created this image halfway, but I was absolutely wrong. Although the plot makes perfect sense in this thriller, maybe I'll have to watch the movie again to fully appreciate all the subtleties. The highlights of the photo, for me, were the fight of Anita's cat and mouse with the killer in the end, a particularly suspenseful house break-in, and a good fight on top of a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie! The good guys at No Shame should be thanked for having yet another great DVD, with interesting and interesting extra subtitles. Of great dress that has revealed itself, in its continuous search to bring back these lost gems from oblivion.
