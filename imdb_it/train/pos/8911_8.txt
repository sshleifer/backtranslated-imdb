I have seen The Blob several times and it is one of the best low budget alien invasion films of the 50s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an old man goes to investigate this. A strange substance similar to a jelly then binds to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the land of meteorites arrive in time and take it to the local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of doing all this. In the end they believe them when the mass, now huge, shows up in the city cinema and everyone runs through the streets shouting. It then sticks on a diner with the young couple and some others inside. The Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers and freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported by plane to the frozen expanses of the Arctic and disposed of there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This film has a typical environment for its time: teenagers and a small town. The Blob has a good theme of rock and roll style in the beginning and the film is full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The continuation, Attention! The Blobs followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of The Blob movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is directed by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the film that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays her girlfriend. I am not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> The Blob is a must see for all science fiction fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
