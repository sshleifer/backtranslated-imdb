Simply the best Estonian film I've ever seen, even though it was made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a fun thriller about a group of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a sort of summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 1990s the Soviet Union fell to pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions could be better in most of those countries. But in the early 1990s many of those new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had bequeathed to them. (And many of them still do it ... at least to a certain level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and a well-written script. Even the actors are very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, plays Snaut in Tarkovski's Solaris), an old and played gangster who slowly tires of his way of life. But the most surprising performance comes from Monika Mäger, a child-actor who plays Terje, a teenage girl in her adolescence, whose presence in the plot is quite essential. (and his name is not even mentioned in the list of credits of IMDb !!!) w <br /> <br /> There are not many films in the world that manage to be both entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does it. Unfortunately the other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of achievement. His first, Kotia päin was too artificial and his last, History is Made at Night was just a weird mess.
