Does anyone know what kind of pickup drove John T? I look like a mid-70s Ford. This film is my favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first memorable film we saw as a married couple. The pick up is interesting as it is similar to the first truck I drove and I found another similar one recently. I'd like to restore the pick up I have to look like in the movie. The music was fantastic too and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who portrayed Giovanni's aunt? Did John also have a stand-in for the tower scene when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show. It looked like a model from the 1960s. Thank you,
