In the Old West there are always men who live breathing the violence and women who hold their breath. A famous earth trainer called Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is hired by the citizens to free the gunslingers (among others Leo Genn, Claude Atkins), the Baronland thugs. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the salon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint as a lawyer is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts up some signs that say the following: Â¨ Beware, the use of guns or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check all the hardware in Marshal's office. Clint finds his former girlfriend, a local lady (Jan Sterling) in charge of the Saloon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among whom). But the city council is afraid of the raw methods carried out by Clint. Finally, the boss's landowner appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his hands. <br /> <br /> This is a tremendously exciting story about a sheriff who only had one more murder to do. It starts as a slow-moving Western but follows us with surprising characters and a solid plot. The story is almost gloomy, a pacifier arrives in a city just in time to secure its citizenship, but later the events get worse. The highlights are the burning at the Saloon and the climatic showdown at the end. Great show for Robert Mitchum as avenging angel and bitter gunslinger, it's the whole show. Lively and lively soundtrack by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Lee Garmes's atmospheric black and white cinematography. The film is incredibly made by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Tre in attico) who made the western as good as "Invitation to a gunslinger and episodes of Zane Gray". Verifiable results for this unusual western.
