I was so surprised by how fantastic The Man In The Moon really was. I mean that initially I expected a predictable and predictable movie, but I decided to put it aside when I watched. Well, when it was over, I had just gotten dizzy (mostly in tears), as far as The Man In The Moon turned out to be. This movie is so funny and is so aware of its tone, and it's just a fabulous movie. The acting was exceptional especially by Reece Witherspoon (who was so cute and adorable), and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt that the ending was predictable, but very well done. I also felt that some things were clear or as if they had been done before, but it's still a great film. Overall I have to say that I don't have much to say about this film, not that it was bad, it's just a movie you like or you do not like it. I would still recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you don't like this type of film, it's still a fun movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
