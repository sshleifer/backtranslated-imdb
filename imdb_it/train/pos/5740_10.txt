The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things that Hollywood no longer produces. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and touching films I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, offer Oscar-caliber performances! There are not enough words to express how beautiful this film is. Of course, people who are not attracted to sentimental films may not be as interested in us as Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us this film goes straight to the heart and to compassion and humanity alone. You will never forget this movie, EVER! <br /> <br /> THE SPOILERS UNDER ***** <br /> <br /> The simple but eloquent story is masterfully told. Eugene is a kindergarten intern who faces long hours and a demanding workload in the hospital. His half brother Brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and clumsy due to brain damage due to a victim of abuse by his father. (A heartbreaking moment in which this is discovered in the film that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish medical school, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick (a.k.a "Nicky") behind, or giving up the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay his brother's kindergarten school fees by working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> The issues of ethics, morals and responsibilities are masterfully mixed in this reference film. Just when Gino thinks that Nicky is making progress towards independence, Dominick turns around and ends up doing things like helping a drug dealer or tying a defective cable that he finds in the dump of an appliance. <br /> Larry, is "The Character" and Nicky's partner on his trash way that fills Dominick's gullible head with all kinds of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, who is teaching in Clinical Pharmacology) going to Atlantic City and gambling all their money But basically, you can see that Larry takes care of him. In their turn, Nicky also makes friends with a boy, whom we find to have been beaten even by his father. A final result is also tragic and the pain you see on Nicky's face when it happens speaks for a long time. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share with one another cannot be exaggerated enough. All Nicky wants to do is be loved and seek acceptance in every way possible. (he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything else in the world. But can his brother become independent enough to allow Geno to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have won more awards than it deserved, but unfortunately it came out at the same time as Rain Man, who was dealing with a similar problem. However, I like Dominick and Eugene more because he has a much stronger emotional component. Know that this film is aimed precisely at tear ducts, so take Kleenex at your fingertips! What film !!!!
