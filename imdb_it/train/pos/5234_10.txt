That day, after a bike ride, lying next to a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour eating and talking with a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood, this film gave me an absolute sense. br /> <br /> The film images were beautiful and that's all you need. Turn off the conscious control of the mind and the work done. <br /> <br /> Reminds me of Baraka (1992) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph. <br /> <br /> This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten. After finishing the counting of all the lines, you realize that there are less than ten, even if less than ten lines are needed to express my comment.
