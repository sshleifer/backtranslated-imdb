"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not on the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many brilliant moments. Basically he follows the lives of Zorak and Brak who have normal lives and go to school, living in a neighborhood in the style of 50 'sitcoms. The humor and animation of this show is very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you can see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's beautiful, it has fun parts. Some of the songs are fantastic, others not so great, but I like this show. The most amusing character is Brak's father. (this is human, nobody knows why)
