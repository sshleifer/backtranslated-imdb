Outstanding film with a slightly slow start - give it the chance to cook. The story develops in interest and complexity. Characters and plot hinder expectations and clich√©s in all the right moments. The superb settings of New York City - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to New York's HBO / Hollywood notion of sex and relationships. It is a rare film that treats its characters honestly and compassionately. I LOVE! Big cast with remarkable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and his love interest (he forgot his name!).
