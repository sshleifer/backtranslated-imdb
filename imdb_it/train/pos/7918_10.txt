I loved this movie. In fact I loved being an actress in this movie. I was described as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the film. You could remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf exposed himself to the cinema. I was the female in the front row with her hands planted on her face in reaction to what we were looking at on the projector. In fact, the double has caught me a couple of times, so it's hard to go wrong. Inches up to full moon high. I wish he could get to the cable soon.
