"One of Hung's best early efforts. Humor is relentless in some parts, while Hung tries to mimic Lee's moves and facial expressions, and even a bit where Hung has fun with Jackie Chan's Drunken Master. The action is also pretty good, especially when Hung takes a trio with martial arts experts at the end. It's not the biggest movie, but pretty good for the kung fu of the 70s, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee, but be careful: most of the video versions of the film have a rather poor quality, there is also a character in blackface that some people might find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a pastor of Rural pigs that moves to Hong Kong to fight some bad Sammo turns on his Bruce Lee imitation for the duration of the fight! <br /> <br /> This film is often advertised as a parody of Bruce's "Enter The Dragon" Lee, but that's not exactly the case ... Sammo is a pastor of rural pigs - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small outdoor restaurant. In the new job, he is forced to defend the restaurant from local gangsters looking for protection. When Sammo switches to combat mode, he turns on his Bruce Lee imitation, which must be seen to be believed! This film is rather sloppy, in many of the fighting scenes Sammo fights against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists, and there is a character who should be black played by an Asian man with a heavy (and absurd) trick. But what this film lacks in terms of budget and accuracy, rather than compensating for the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
