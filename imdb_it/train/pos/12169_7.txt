On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the gorgeous dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar, they drink a lot together and the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his girlfriend Karen (Selma Blair) could arrive in his apartment, and desperately asks Becky to leave her seat quickly. Soon, he discovers that she has crabs, and later, in the preparation of her wedding dinner, she realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy, with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent and extremely gorgeous actresses, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly funny, has good performances. I laughed a lot in the story, but there are some really hilarious scenes. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds it he paints; his imagination in many situations; in the drugstore, trying to buy and get explanations about crab medicine; most of his neighbor's scenes, the minister; when Karen calls the department store; or when the police find a suspect of aggression to Paul. I could number many other scenes, but better to rent the reader or buy this movie and have a lot of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
