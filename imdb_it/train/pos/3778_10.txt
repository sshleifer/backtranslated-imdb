The first film had little ambition, so nothing sticks to the screen. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. Once accepted that Bill & Ted are stupid, the joke can be beaten on the public for so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards, it's more fun. This was avoided at the time of release, sadly considering that more talents are involved than the first time. We get the photographer of 'Face / Off', the editor of 'Fugitive', a production designer for Burton's early works, and the 'Matrix' sound designer. <br /> <br /> The authors have compensated for their superficiality by first coming out with something profound. Since this was avoided by the public and fans, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not, it adapts to the material. Like "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22", this dares to be smart, but we like our "simple" films, so we don't buy them. Probably since he dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to make it. What's so beautiful? <br /> <br /> - Beautiful self-reference to Keanu; from empty head to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts, he does his own hatred. The Evil B & T and the "good robots usses" have the same vocabulary as their originals: fewer copies and devaluation of the language. <br /> <br /> - The reason for "duality". Nowhere else is this evident compared to photography styles, many high and low angles. They also use Roy Brocksmith from "Total Recall" to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The reason for the "choices". I don't know where it started in the genus (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's used quite well here. It is even reduced to 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Self-referential film, also present in the game against Death (Clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Note the cover of Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Irony also of how Death and Nomolos were bad in the sequels of "Die Hard" and "Lethal Weapon". <br /> <br /> I still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and movies are different media so it doesn't make sense why so many screenplays revolve around the first - particularly in the teenage market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these films he is wasted. Also, how much the audacity shown by this effort, even by beating the gay jokes, can't kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, despite resembling the Nickelodeon production, it's incredibly interesting. From this film we have Beavis and Butt-Head. "We're in paradise and we've just robbed three people." <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Midrange Material
