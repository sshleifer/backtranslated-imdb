Level One, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time at 10am, I knew it would give me nightmares. He did it. Surprisingly, as I recall, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them. <br /> <br /> Second level, Psychoanalytic Theory. <br /> <br /> Later as an adult, I saw the story for what it was: what would happen if the wild, unbridled instincts that we all repressed became evident. <br /> <br /> Level Three, Pure Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to plausibly realize the "What if" plot is through the science fiction genre. This is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that pass for the genre today. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all sci-fi movies. If you plan a remake, SKG or Lucas, watch out!
