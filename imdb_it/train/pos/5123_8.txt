A single unmarried bachelor (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in a Texan honky-tonk. At face value, it's a modern, Texas-style love story. There are cowboy hoods, pickup trucks, neon beer signs and references to large belt buckles and rodeos. The music, if not native to Texas, is adapted to Texas, thanks to the talent of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and the Charlie Daniels Band. And that twang of Texas ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and characters are as subtle as the flavor of the five-pepper Texas chilli made with Jalapeno peppers. It's enough for civilized spectators to abort the film in favor of a refined classic, one with Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman, perhaps. "Hamlet" is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I like it a little. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is generally good. Dialogue, production design and costumes are all realistic; the assembly is skillful. And both casting and acting are commendable, if not worthy Oscar. I wouldn't have played Travolta in the role he plays, but he does a great job ... ditto Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson are also good at supporting roles. But the cinematography seemed weak. The copy of the film I saw was grainy and sometimes suffered from a reddish / orange tinge, a visual trait that I noticed in other films of the same period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film does not seem to offer a social or political "message". But I would say that when "Urban Cowboy" was published twenty-five years ago, it had rather prophetic implications. In 1980 the United States had all kinds of problems, not least those of the American hostages held by Iran. In many people's minds then, the United States was being pushed around, bullied. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of its time, offered something that Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. .. "Urban Cowboy" constitution is a very physical film. The characters in it cannot be the brightest people on Earth. But they are difficult! <br /> <br /> Everything about "Urban Cowboy" is anti-intellectual. As a vehicle for cultural expression, this 1980 film was one of many that wished a new era for the United States. It started in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that was continued until today, with a President who probably won't be remembered for his intellect, but he will be remembered for his harshness and aggressiveness, traits that Americans seem to gravitate like surely the Texans to five pounds of alarms.
