What is the best way to start a review of a film like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I have just come directly from watching this film, and the images are still burning in my brain - and I don't think they will move soon. <br /> <br /> It is probably fair to say that if you are on this page you have a good idea of ​​what kind of movie it is even if you haven't seen it. Otherwise, I warn you that this is not a moderate budget jewel that has been lost to "Near Dark" for a few years, nor is it a low budget, schlocky, "funny" series B movie. low-cost art, offered in a simple but moving way. The idea is simple: seven stories revolve around and end in suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse. Sounds simple, even boring? It is not. Words can't really describe how powerful this film is when you get halfway; attracts you practically inside if you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could go around here on the technical advantages and disadvantages of the management; perhaps you point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are sometimes shaky. I could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in a way of rivaling any Fulci film, but in the end all this seems to become insignificant. <br /> <br /> So far as extreme films, I have seen the most difficult of them, yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few others have succeeded, although it is not particularly bloody and with few scenes that I would consider "free" . In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I won't ruin it, just to say that the emotional agony of the character practically drips from the screen and makes you sympathetic, if not anxious about its end. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is not the best film that has ever been made, and in many places it looks rough and maybe a little amateur, but despite these flaws Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone I like stimulating cinema. If you are a person who likes to watch comfortably or "beautiful" movies, or simply want to break something brutal and useless, this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, it's one of those you wouldn't forget to hurry.
