For all those who do not speak Swedish: the [original] Swedish title of this film; "Rånarna" translates into something in the line of "The Robbers". This is the main problem I have with the film, because it is not the thieves at all. It's about a young woman who works for the Swedish police looking for robberies. A normal desk job, one might think, but this girl is soon on the field to take the situation in her hands, as the story goes, even shoot one of the thieves ... Exactly: we've seen it before. The fact that there is a rather interesting turn in the plot halfway does not help much the final is just as cliché of the first two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What saves him from being just another mainstream film is the fact that he is masterfully executed in all ways, that the actors are fantastic as they are and do not behave exaggeratedly and that the director it really manages to keep it as exciting as it is exciting for most of the story. /> <br /> One thing I really loved about this film is the fact that it is the music that gives the right mood when it is needed, but it is absent for the rest of the time, which gives a sense of reality to the clashes and car chases have spread throughout the film. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who tend to become typographically hurts the movie because you know he has no intention of playing the heroine's boyfriend and being a supportive character in the background, but it's something you should overlook. <br /> <br /> All in all it is a funny film that steals more money in the plot than time from you. 7/10
