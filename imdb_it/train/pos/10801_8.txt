Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago I immediately wanted to turn it off. As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor who played Navin had stolen the show. His facial expressions and his comedy behavior make me shake my head because he hasn't been in other comedies. He has this thing about "Marty Feldman" that is giving him but VERY, VERY talented ... without taking anything away from Marty. The film really shocked me how close he was to the original Jerk, but then again, it was MUCH MORE. I really think that if this movie was released for the first time and I saw the Steve Martin 2nd film, I thought the second one was a cheap rip-off. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. Actually I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is second to the actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. I urge you to see it if you can find it.
