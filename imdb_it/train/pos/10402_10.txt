I saw Thief for the first time as a child, which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I imagine. As any child would have been, I was entranced by the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed in that first vision. I have never missed the opportunity to see it during the intermediate years. In addition to the script, production transcends the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the narrator at his best. When you see Thief as a child, you know you've had a lot of fun. When you see Thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It is timeless like the story it covers. A fantastic job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
