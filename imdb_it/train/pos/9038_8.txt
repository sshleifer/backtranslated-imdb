I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most was music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a period of time. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now perfectly fits the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the music, I loved the cast too. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise to me. He gave a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I saw this film about how to escape the life already prepared for you twice, and both times I had a great time.
