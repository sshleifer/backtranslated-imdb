When tradition requires that an artist must transmit his great abilities and his magic to an heir, the elderly and very proud street artist, known to all as "The king of masks", desperately seeks a young apprentice to adopt and cultivate. His warmth and humanity, however, find him paying a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive floods in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> takes his new 7-year-old companion on his straw houseboat, to live with his beautiful and precious monkey, "General", only to discover that the he-child is a she- child. <br /> <br /> life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave is intertwined in the astonishing tradition that requires him to pass on his art only to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories inside this ... many people are touched and the culture of China opens up to our Western eyes to observe. Thousands of years of inheritance are reduced to a drama teacup, and few will leave this DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not great, because I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in different parts of the film. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
