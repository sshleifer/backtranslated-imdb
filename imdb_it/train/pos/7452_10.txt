I'm a big fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's fun, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. It's great for small children because it's nice, Cinderella and great for adults and teenagers because it's fun and not over the top. I looked at it when I was little and I still look at it now. It has broad lines that my family and I always mention. Acting is great and never gets old. If you like fairy tales and novels you'll love this. I have seen many Cinderella movies in my day and this is the best of all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the shows of Faerie Tale Theater. They all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very funny.
