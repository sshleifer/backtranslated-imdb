I don't know why some boys from the United States, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings for something they don't understand at all. For those who haven't watched this movie - watch it. Don't expect too much or don't put some structures just because this is Kosturica. Watch the film without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - the people of Serbia really got married while Bil Clinton bombards their villages, the gypsies in all the Balkans are ALWAYS trying to fuck you in every possible way, LOVE it's always unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who say this is a bad movie, I can only see that American sh * t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) are much worse than a humorous film of pure, frank and Balkan love like Promise me. The comment should be useful and in second place should represent the personal vision of the writer. I think the film is fantastic and people watch that they must give their respect to the director and to the story told inside. It's simple, but true. It's brutal, but kind and makes you laugh until you die.
