High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrific assault on their high school. At the beginning of the lethal countdown to their last act of revenge, the two begin a video diary to explain their feelings and tell their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar film like this, called "Elephant". Why am I talking about it? To compare the two films, of course. I have to say, although I liked "Elephant", this is a much better film. What's the difference, ask? Well, to begin with, this is shot differently, much along the lines of "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead". This makes the film even better because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what won me over was how the film was willing to show "the other side of the story". You will know these two shooters, unlike "Elephant". Actually I took care of one of the shooters and I could understand their actions and why they did what they did. In reality this film makes you feel solidarity with these people and this is a good thing because it is not always in black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real human beings with the logic and reasons behind their actions. You understand them. It's not like they want to kill people to get attention. Overall, this film is emotionally engaging and very disturbing and much better than "Elephant".
