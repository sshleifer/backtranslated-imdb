A recent vision of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT gave me the impulse to watch many of the classic MGM musicals of the forties and fifties. ANCORS AWEIGH is definitely a minor film by ON THE TOWN. The songs are not so good, nor the chemistry between the characters. But the film marvelously interweaves the favorite classics, like Ciajkovskij. And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it, and then going down the steps, while dozens of pianists play the piano, it's the best scene in the film, even though the scene where Kelly dance with Jerry Mouse is most famous. Classical music lovers will undoubtedly identify the music that pianists play. Sinatra then sings "I Fall in Love Too Easily", before having his epiphany on those he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and the air without pollution (can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, not to mention the mid-40s?!), And piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM has certainly had a talent for creating lyrical moments like these.
