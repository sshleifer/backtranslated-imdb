First, the female protagonist is too beautiful to be lost. Now the actress Wang Zu Xian, the one who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 and well aged. It's always nice to see these glorious times when you see Hong Kong productions of old school like this. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles made in the 1980s. The decoration of the artistic set and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing. More fantastic the film had a total black humorous undertone in it. It looks like a horror movie, but in the end it's not scary, but just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story", and I thought that script was a good script. However, when I saw the film, I was initially disappointed to see the film different from the script, as in a smaller scale and involving more comedic roles. However, it turned out to be better executed in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarities in this movie with LOTR. The culmination is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch. It's definitely a loud laugh. Good boy!
