well, I said everything in the summary, I just loved the movie and the cast ... I would give each actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 and I've watched it 4 times in different periods and I think as long as I don't cry and always do it, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. it was absolutely brilliant, even the jeremy irons ... simply brilliant ... I wish the film had received more awards ... I really don't know anyone who looked at him and didn't love him ... even, glenn close was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I liked the fact that despite everything Clara and Esteban loved each other so much, and how close she was to her parents ...
