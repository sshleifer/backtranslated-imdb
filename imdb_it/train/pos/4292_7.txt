I didn't know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the "non-expectation" factor that helped me stand up and then like it more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The plot has gaps / jumps that I think throws the audience a bit. There is not a great soundtrack in the background, creating the "romantic" atmosphere. BUT they didn't care all. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was a strange inexplicable chemistry that I couldn't resist; I fell in love with this and here I am, writing this review. The subtle loving representation of the two actors was superb, and I believe this is the core of this film. <br /> <br /> This film is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not everyone will appreciate it. I had to sit down a little and then slowly started to understand the little things that I didn't catch at first. I can't guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope it does.
