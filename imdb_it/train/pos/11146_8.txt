Fascinated downer on an aspiring male cheater in New York forced to live in a building condemned with a crippled swindler. Extremely squalid examination of the moral and social decline of modern times, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who never passed his work here) and played superbly by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. He makes a big punch overall, yet the "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played for a laugh - are slightly intrusive, as is the "mod" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, but filmmakers are careful not to let go, and this gives the image an advantage that it could not have had with a lesser director of Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969, he won the Best Picture Oscar; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo's book Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 from ****
