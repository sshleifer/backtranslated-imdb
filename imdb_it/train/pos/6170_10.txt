I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and I was overwhelmed. It is a rich and warm novel brought to the screen, beautifully acted and well directed. More than anything else, it reminded me of David Lean's films, both for his ability to handle a complex story, and for his ability to create powerful scenes that affect different levels. The best film I've seen in years.
