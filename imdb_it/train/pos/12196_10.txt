Orson Welles manages to beat me on the ass with every picture he sees. Lady of Shanghai is on a par with her other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. Sometimes the plot can be confusing and sometimes it seems to be moving a little too fast (about an hour has been eliminated when the test screens have gone bad). It doesn't matter, anyway. You can't watch Welles' movies and be able to focus too much on the plot. His direction defines which great direction he is. Almost all the scenes in this film can stand up to any other scene he directs. Take a look at the courtroom scene. Usually these scenes are such that I can't stand them. Case in point, try to sit through Welles's speech near the end of Compulsion. In Lady of Shanghai, pay attention to the level of detail in that court scene. Look at that juror who always sneezes and interrupts the proceedings. Or take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian, and that it has been used constantly in film noir and crime films of the time, but Welles gives it its own beauty. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the ability, an ability that no one else seemed to have, to make a detective film containing examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he was talking to Shakespeare or spitting hard lines, he had the power to shake the soul. 10/10.
