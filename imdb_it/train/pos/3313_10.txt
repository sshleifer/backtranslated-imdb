A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say that his recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette excites us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. A rainbow of emotions and talent, Bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as the new songs from the "Bette of Roses" album. Spanning generations of people offers something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva here proves to be the most intense talented artist around.
