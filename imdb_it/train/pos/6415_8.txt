TIllman Jr.'s drama on the first African American Navy Master Diver (Gooding Jr.), which challenges all odds and achieves its goals despite a strictly bitter coach. The script is not bad, sometimes a bit extreme, but the direction and the acting are top notch, and this film is inspiring and achieves what it should do. I liked DeNiro in the lead, even if he is not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and all others) he is as good as his other good performances like in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and credible here, excellent performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, certainly one of his best shows. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my vote: 9/10
