I have to be one of the best political satires I've seen to date, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the secondary actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well placed and a great unexpected twist at the end. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all I give a great appreciation to this film. He is extremely critical of the US military intervention in the Middle East and as such could receive negative criticism from people who do not share the same political vision or are simply politically ignorant to appreciate dark humor and drk. In fact, in places, the play was so close to the truth that it was on the border between funny and tragic.
