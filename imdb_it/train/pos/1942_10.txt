I consider myself a great lover of cinema. I was sick on the couch and I burst into this movie. From the opening to the end I looked at these great actors with awe, I had never seen them, I said big words. The shooting was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message will be heard about any negative comments written by others. The director has a heart and beats with his actors. Thanks for making a movie like this. Simply wonderfully clumsy, beautiful gentle characters who are imperfect and graceful at the same time. Simply fantastic I can't present this without 10 lines in total, so I'll just keep saying that I want more from this director, more from all the actors in this movie and more from the writer. I didn't want it to end. The end
