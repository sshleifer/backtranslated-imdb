Now, for all the movie fans out there, this movie may not be at the top of your list of things to see. But if you know something about the development of the plot, the profound truth and the intentions that this film (the series) had, you would understand my pov <br /> <br /> Granted, the film's specifications are the writer's renderings, that one cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and rightly "scares" viewers to think about what it could be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film is the potential that something like the circumstances depicted in it can greatly scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather a means to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know that I will not leave behind, and thanks to films like this, I can look beyond the superficiality of entertainment, acting and the film budget to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer . This is a film that you should not only see, but feel with heart and soul.
