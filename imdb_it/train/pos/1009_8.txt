Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a science fiction TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no elusive facts. How much you try to apologize or explain it Stargate SG-1 remains a science fiction television series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas vividly. The special effects are not as impressive as they could have been and the action will not blow your chair. Or even the sofa. <br /> <br /> But, and this is where I really think that Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for every stolen episode or idea I think it can count on at least one science fiction movie that's actually worse of a one-hour television episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes actually could last 90 minutes and were still better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And being able to maintain that quality during the show and continue to provide and push the plot further is what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very fussy with my selections. I follow perhaps one or two TV series to the maximum and I maintain rather high standards that made me even more surprised when I found myself surprised. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to brush Stargate SG-1 yet another science fiction show, no. Stay true and you'll see what I'm talking about.
