but it is worth looking for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainment that was shot during the war or required transplanting to the American shores, like in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles they didn't fit. Bacall fits this part here. I kept waiting for her to whistle and bring Bogie to life; his tone of voice is simply wrong for an upper class woman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people don't talk that way except in books, but Greene was sending a message about an England that had to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's range of characters has been kept whole. While Mr. Mukerjee looked more like a Brahamin, at least his nationality was maintained, and his last conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
