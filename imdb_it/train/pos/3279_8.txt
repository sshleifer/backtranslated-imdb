I'm glad it's now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style over flashing lights with empty heads and loud and constant noises. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a poor attention span or if you lack the spirit and imagination to interact with literary fiction you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs did a fantastic job transposing the story of Catherine Storr's novel "Marianne Dreams" successfully into a script. An unenviable task like anyone who has seen a film of a book will no doubt know. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, allowing the director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; dedicate themselves to the art of acting! I know, I know, the actors doing their job and acting instead of resorting to invading the camera lens while a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and gunfights go wild around them is a real surprise, but in reality it happens in this film. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the last reason why this is a film for the imaginative thinker and not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - In addition to a solid script, direction and acting, it is based on the atmosphere, implicit suspense and horror. If it is to be classified as horror, the presentation of "Paper House" is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, therefore, if you like lots of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts and flashing bright colors you would be better off watching 'Transformers', but if you like a suspenseful story that develops through use wise and evocative of narrative without insulting your intelligence with the force that feeds you with cacophonous nonsense then this could just be your thing.
