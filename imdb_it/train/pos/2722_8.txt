This reconstruction of the infamous 1959 murders in Kansas, based on the book Capote, is abruptly filmed by Brooks and the director of photography Hall in black and white, giving it a documentary touch. There are good performances by Blake and Wilson as murderers and Forsythe as cops who pursue them. The scenes that lead to the murders, filmed in the royal house where the crime occurred, with a soundtrack of hissing winds, are quite intense and chilling. Brooks directs with much verve and uses several interesting transitions between the scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit exaggerated, with the conclusion dragged and somehow predicated.
