I really enjoyed this. I thought it would be a documentary, but it turned out to be a good piece of language in a funny smile. <br /> <br /> I think this was well done, practically an extended TV program in a movie, but because of the characters or rather the original actors, the willingness to have fun and make fun of it helps this work in an old way Innocent style. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the original TV series then I am sure you will like this. <br /> <br /> Q
