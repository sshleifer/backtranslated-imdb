When DEATHTRAP was published for the first time, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - offered a graphic similar to that of a Rubik's Cube. It is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, author of memorable works such as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of the most famous Broadway twister, and under the direction of Sidney Lumet translates extremely well the screen . <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very difficult to discuss, because doing it in every detail gives the plot for which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely intelligent: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of thrillers, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sent him a script for a play he wrote. It's called "Deathtrap" and Sidney recognizes it as an infallible success. Just the kind of blow that would bring his career back to life ... in fact, a success to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the comedy, the events suddenly begin to turn as unexpectedly as possible. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer's equally twisted SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on stage than on screen - to reach full power it needs the immediacy that offers a live performance. Still, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, he makes a representation more than respectable on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast, which is extraordinarily good. Michael Caine offers a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is as entertaining and engaging as his wife relentlessly anxious about Sidney, and Christopher Reeve gives what could be the best performance in his unpleasantly short directorial career. If you can't see it in a first-rate theater production, this will be more than until you arrive. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
