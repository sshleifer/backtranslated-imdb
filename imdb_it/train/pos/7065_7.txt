Nice film about three lively Swiss sisters (often looking for pairings) who want to bring their parents back together (it seems that the mother still carries the torch for dad) - so they set sail for New York to prevent the father from marrying a blonde hunter gold that he calls "Precious". Dad hasn't seen his daughters for ten years, they (strangely) don't seem to care and think it's wonderful, and meanwhile Precious seems to lead a life primarily run by his overbearing mother (Alice Brady), a woman she just wants to see at her daughter marries a rich man. The sisters have the idea of ​​pushing Precious on the way of a drunken Hungarian count, tricking the two women who dig gold and making him believe he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity suggests to the girls that the count is good-looking Ray Milland, who follows the pattern because he has a crush on his sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This film is fun, light. Barbara Reads how Kay looks sweet and pretty, Ray Milland looks so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, he is given little to do), Alice Brady is quite as good as the intriguing mother - but it's Deanna Durbin, a real charmer and nice as a key that plays the younger sister, Penny, who practically steals the show. With an absolutely beautiful voice, he sings several songs throughout the film, although in reality I would have liked to see them perform even more in this. The plot of this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless I found the film fun and entertaining.
