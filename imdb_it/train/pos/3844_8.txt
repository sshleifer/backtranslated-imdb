When you read the summary of this film, you may come to think that it is a strange film and in a sense it is, for the main character of this film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is obsessed with visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle hints at what will happen to him as the story continues and it is very fun for the viewer to try to understand the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints at the end of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement and does not become boring for a minute. This is largely due to the great interpretations of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and to the great direction by Paul Verhoeven. His directing style is clearly visible and one can say, looking at it from different angles, that "De Vierde Man" is a typical Verhoeven film. Not only will it seem typical for people who are familiar with his American films because of nudity and violent graphic scenes, but it will also seem typical for people who are familiar with his Dutch films, because of the same things and his talent in telling a great story. When people watch Verhoevens' American films, short-sighted people might say that they have no talent for telling a good story and focus only on blood and sex. This is what some people think, while I think he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each film. Although it is not a good film, Hollow Man (his latest American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction films and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more films to helm. He needs it. Watch his Dutch films. Not only do they show they need some freedom, but they also show that they have a remarkable talent. 'De Vierde Man' took him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
