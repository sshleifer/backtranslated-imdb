A journey of discovery, this film follows the lives of a family living in a sleepy island town in British Columbia. Linguistic and dreamy, the inhabitants are content to allow life to turn around them until a young teacher, fresh-faced, comes up with new ideas and brings his life with him from the mainland. Slowly, their sluggish state awakens, the father (and the principal of the local school) seeks excitement, the mother for stability, the eldest daughter for love and the youngest for power. Although not an incredible or innovative piece of cinema, the film is quietly pleasant and suitable for a tired night when the wind is blowing. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada will find it easily accessible.
