The Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack team produced a documentary of 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter pasture. The fundamental value of this film today is like a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we Westerners knew as the "roaring Twenties". A more drastic contrast could not be imagined. The rushing river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water, in fact, die. To ensure that the public of the time believed that the story took place, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand on its own and be appreciated without the film. That said, the film probably has more value for the anthropologist than for the casual viewer looking for good evening entertainment. The crew had just enough supplies to resume the shots they recorded and there is no fancy photographic work resulting from multiple repetitions. Western inter-titles diminish the experience, but they are actually a part of the record since they show how Hollywood has tried to put their lives on the life of an indigenous population to be appreciated by the public of the day. The off-duty entertainment of the desert police becomes a "policeman's ball". The producers continued to produce the docu-drama Chang (1927) and the totally commercial King Kong (1933). The theme of migration is again used in People of the Wind (1976) and in the Himalayas (1999). Recommended to those who know in advance what they are getting into - and therefore highly recommended for them.
