The good old black and white Graham Greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things. Hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred times more interesting than the glory that was coined by Hollywood today. Bacall lights up the screen and Boyer is completely engaging. They don't make films like this anymore.
