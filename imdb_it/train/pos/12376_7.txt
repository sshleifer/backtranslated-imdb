Equipped with a cast of famous actors so impressive as to seem almost the "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" of horror films, "The Sentinel" (1977) is however a disturbing film centered on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this, he plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is (and I don't think I am giving away too much to this last date) very close to Hell's door. And as a tenant in this building, he suffers from much worse conditions than leaky pipes and the occasional water bug, to put it mildly! In fact, the scene in which Alison meets its noisy neighbor upstairs is truly terrifying, and should certainly send the icy water that runs along the thorns of most viewers. Despite the critics 'numerous complaints about Raines' acting ability, I thought he was fine, more than tenderly on stage with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The image ends with a really disturbing conclusion, and even if some points of the plot are not explained, I felt more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" says, "any film with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in bodys can't be all negative"! On a side note, yesterday I went to Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to check out the Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although shorn from the heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest / nun in the upper floor window, it looks very similar to the one in this photo. If this house is really at the top of the entrance to hell, I understand that hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known for some time!
