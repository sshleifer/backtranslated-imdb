This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The film is extraordinary, sometimes hypnotic. He also received an Oscar for best photography, and deservedly. I have a lot of films in my movie collection and many others I've seen besides them, and not many of them are more beautiful or even just as wonderfully beautiful as this. <br /> <br /> It is unique and a great general film. The cast is exceptional and does a great job in portraying their characters. We follow their destiny with devotion and we feel very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot about this film for what it represents and how it presents it. I highly recommend it
