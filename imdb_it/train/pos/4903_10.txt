Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson and her All Girls Orchestra, who performed during the war years at Covent Garden Opera, this film tells the story of attempts by an old saxophonist to reform the (almost) band of girls with whom he has played as a student towards the end of World War II. All the flashbacks too short for the original band on stage bring us wonderful music, and help to make the band members, and in particular the girls' relationships with the solitary male member - their drummer in disguise (who is trying to dodge the call-up). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench turn into excellent performances like the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the conniving and feminizing Patrick, the drummer. Comrade Joan Sims is perfect as a band leader, now plays the piano bar by the sea, and June Whitfield emits light as a trombonist of the Salvation Army. Cameo's appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The film is a lane to remember, with a cast of stars of what should, in effect, be a group of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years old. Surely it continues to throb! While watching him, I mentally scolded the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age. Later, I looked at these girls and discovered that each of them is old enough to perform in London in 1944 (although this may be a little too long for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing groups, if you like nostalgia, or if you just want to see how beautiful a woman can be with almost three quarters of a century behind her, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br />
