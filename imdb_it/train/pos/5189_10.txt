Another Woo's masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is the best Wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - the greatest director of the century. <br /> <br /> Maybe hi is no more intellectual than many great directors ... But he is a lyrical and spiritual idol of all free people! <br /> <br /> His films like great poetry! Woo is a Sheakspeare movie! Woo is a Biron movie! Woo is a Bloodshet Mozart !!!! <br /> <br /> Violent IMHO in Woo's films is not a bloodthirsty director, but an art tool. The themes of Woo's films are more humanistic than most of the new films.
