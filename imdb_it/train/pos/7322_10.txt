Halloween is one of those movies that make you feel deep! I think it's the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best black man ever! It was so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there are no special effects where you can tell how the computer is animated, this was on a low budget and had a score of a note, but it managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this film still has the same effect as in 1978. <br /> <br /> It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at age 6 and so many years later he runs away from the psychiatric institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is following him and will do anything to bring him back, as he describes Michael as "... pure evil, the blackest eyes, the eyes of the Devil". Michael is on a mission to kill the other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit Halloween, while her friends are out partying and, of course, we know the rules, they understand! But Laurie could have a chance since she is a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays a lot of tribute to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, Janet Leigh's daughter. Halloween is an absolutely exceptional film that breaks the boundaries and makes you close the doors, close the windows and turn off the lights! "They'll get you! They'll get you!" Halloween, the definitive horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
