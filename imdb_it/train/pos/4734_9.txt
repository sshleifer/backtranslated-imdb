I'm a big Jet Li fan! It is the best live action movie star HK ... and consequently - This movie has been shaken! I saw it in the video store and, like in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, I didn't register his presence at first, and I had to watch twice. I immediately understood what I would rent. My only skill (I guess I expected it) is that he has been nicknamed (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Otherwise, the original / strange / cunt plot of the film and action packed made it one of the best films of Jet Li ... even though they all fall into this category ....
