CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary Nekojiru manga. He won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Prize" at the Japan Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the soul of the little kitten Nyaako is stolen from death, she and she brother Nyatta embarks on a bizarre journey to get him back. In the surreal dream scenario of the Other Side, they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable and often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, extraordinarily beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there are no dialogues) and sometimes cruel and bloody. So it's more like an anime for adults than children (they might not understand at all!). A great trip for those who have the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. Not to be missed!
