The cast is excellent, the acting good, the plot interesting, the evolution full of suspense ... but it is difficult to enclose all those elements in a film that lasts just 80 minutes. If it had taken longer to develop the plot and subplots, it would have had a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this film very good rather than good.
