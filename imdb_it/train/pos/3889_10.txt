Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comic genius, and he is Eddie at his best. His material is extremely witty and fun, and his delivery is among the best ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the public's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his preferences about the wardrobe, Hitler, the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs, you can't help but repeat some of his lines. More and more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. Every first-rate standing comedy fan must see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British stand-up comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard fought for success outside the live stage. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not be indicative of how truly talented he is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, which fortunately found its way to home video, and can and should be appreciated again and again.
