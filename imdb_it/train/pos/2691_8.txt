Probably the best result obtained by Bigas Luna reaches a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. Delightful Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young Biel Duran's pre-adolescent lust. He can't get May's hair off his head and he wants to suck and suck his mother's breast so much. His search for May is the film. As in the works of Luna as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensitivity to his strange but beautiful story. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will appreciate this frothy erotic female breast poem. The images by Jos√© Luis Alcaine are wonderful and the soundtrack by Nicola Piovani is sweet and rich. A splendid film pack with a deliciously anarchic sensibility that the Spaniards do naturally.
