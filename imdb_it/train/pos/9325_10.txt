I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who finally saw each other after their father died. Ryan and Theo at first discuss who did what. But later, Theo discovers that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but is dying from a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time adjusting their differences. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible film. I only saw Colm Feore in season 7 of 24 but it was phenomenal in this. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard of before, did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is a movie not to be missed. <br /> <br /> I tell this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
