This film, even if it concerns one of the favorite arguments of the producers of Mexican producers: the extreme life in our cities, has a fun way of putting it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican directors, of the last times, approach the stories of our city framed in various literary genres as can be the farce or the satire, which gives us a film with an overexposed topic in our country, but narrated in a very different way that gives it a fresh tone. <br /> <br /> With little-known actors who excellently interpret their paper, each of the directors reflects in our stories the ability on our part to have been identified anywhere in the world, that ability to laugh pains and to celebrate sadness. Perhaps many people in our country did not like the film, but I believe that people from other countries might find the surrealism of the Mexican attractive and sharing.
