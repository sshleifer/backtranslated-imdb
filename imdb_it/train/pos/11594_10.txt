I just found the IMDb and searched for this movie and was moved to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this movie like I did when I was about 6 in 1967? I saw it before the jungle book, so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for next year. I burst into tears in the cinema when the boy turned into Eagle and always wanted to see the movie again. When we got home we had a dinner with roast chicken and I got the bone of desire and guess who I wanted to be? My father then said "I bet you wanted to be an Eagle" and, of course, we all know that desires break if someone guesses even more tears and some resentment for not being able to fly away ...
