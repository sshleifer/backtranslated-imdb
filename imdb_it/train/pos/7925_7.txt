The silly movie is really, really fun. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a little too obvious, it decreases a little in the second half and the story is an incoherent disorder, but it's a funny laugh at all costs. And it's only worth seeing Ed McMahon as a kook of the right. This film is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny and undervalued film.
