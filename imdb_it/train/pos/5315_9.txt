This film was very, very strange and very, very funny. All the actors are quite real and very strange. Even the overall "look" of the film was different, a bit mushy and dreamy, which only added to the spatiality, joy and strangeness of the whole film. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean it's not what you'd call "mainstream", but that's what I liked. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. . . unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places. The children are so heartbreaking (and pimply) that you can't help but try for them. In other words, these are far from the "Hollywoodized" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Everyone, who for me, make it a good thing.
