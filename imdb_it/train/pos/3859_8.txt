Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I've ever seen. It was really a pleasant surprise. The story is about the bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), while he is drawn into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in Gerard's twisted mind there may be more to the story. Verhoeven and filmmaker Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and disgusting sexual images, this really gets you into the story, you don't want to look, but you can't get away. This is by far the best film of Verhoeven (perhaps second only to Robocop). True The Four Man is not for everyone, some sex scenes are quite free (ignore them, but believe me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you will be kidnapped. This is one of those movies you need to know how it turns out, a real one melody in the tradition of Hitchcock, compelling, controversial and electrifying.I also like the metaphor of the spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
