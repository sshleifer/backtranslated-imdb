This "coming of age" movie tells the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, who learn life and love a fatal summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in "To Kill a Mockingbird", the film never hits a false note. All the acting is superb. Like Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a splendid film debut. Looking at this wonderfully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I seemed to look at reality through a window rather than watch a movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film at least 5 times, and I can honestly say that it is one of the best single films ever made about being young, being in love and going through the feelings, challenges and changes of young adulthood . Families with children between 10 and 15 should look at them together and use them as a topic of discussion, as it raises a series of questions about brotherly rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.
