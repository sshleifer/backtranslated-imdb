Since some years have passed since I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back and see it more deeply, but first some notes from a film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, it was fantastic, I miss some of this stuff today that clearly we don't see what we did in the past, also to the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte which is called in Denmark is a great animated series, it is very similar to chips and dale, ducklings and many of the old ones, so it has that strange feeling that surrounds it, I can't remember this series as much as I would remember it. <br /> <br /> But I think it was fantastic, it came with a kind of message, not so wild of a message, yet it is one of the old ones so they can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I don't want to look old or anything, but I feel like time slips from my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything else we have, we all have these shows new or almost new like Hannah Montana or something like that, yet I feel that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows as we did in the early days. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I was wrong, but it seems to me that time has changed a lot, to conclude I would be thrilled to see these series as Talespin released again on the TV screen instead of all the new ones, give me back the cartoons my childhood, give them to the children I have one day, give them back ...
