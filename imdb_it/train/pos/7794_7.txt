Victor Nunez imbibes this non-sentimental story of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry rarely seen in cinema. By poetry I mean the sense in which they enter into literary and cinematographic play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel had been adapted page by page to the screen. In this sense, the film reaches depths that many cannot; but it is also quite slow at other times, subtracting the depths that once reached in favor of boredom. The movie star Ashley Judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here. It adapts to the role of the protagonist Ruby like a glove, almost as if it were not forced to act. She has a real cinematic presence in the film and failed to convey the same charm in her later films, even though it was impressive in Normal Life.
