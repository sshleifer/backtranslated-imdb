I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale seem incredibly immature in her role. The film is imperfect only because it seems that the two accused seem to be in some monastery, working as monks in the grass and under strict discipline almost martial. The acting and the filmography and the incredible colors of what is supposed to be Thailand is captivating, but Claire Daines steals the entire movie, and is unexpectedly deep in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the end, in an incredible unprecedented and completely unexpected altruism in the real world. The flaws are minimal and I recommend the film, which seems sadly buried forever in rare TV shows. I for one want the film for my collection, a collection of only films classified as "10". Look at it, you'll be very touched.
