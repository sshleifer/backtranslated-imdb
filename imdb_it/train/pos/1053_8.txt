Sisters In Law is composed by the same directors of the "Divorce, Iranian style", rather curiously fascinating, which was exactly as stated, since we saw the divorce court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the judicial system in Cameroon, in Africa. The outstanding thing about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women, which is unusual for a country like this. However, they deal with a lot of men used to making their way around women, but this film is remarkable in that it seems that women have made great strides in society, with the recognition of legal divorce and women's rights . So judges often punish men for behaving primitively in these times. Not to mention that women who appear at the court get the softest treatment. One of the main aspects of the film is a case of child abuse made by an aunt. The judges do not waste time challenging the woman with fury. And who said justice was no longer served? With these 2 behind the bench. They often make maximum penalties! Ya! Go girl!
