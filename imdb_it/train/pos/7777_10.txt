The rich and alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall. The bride and she is so happy that she stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks' best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks' nympho sister, Dorothy Malone, loves after Rock. Throws in some complications and the film runs without control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> Very polished film in beautiful Technicolor with stunning fashions and furnishings (check out Bacall's hotel room at the beginning). They all look perfect and dress in beautiful, tight-fitting clothes. Basically this is a soap opera with grade A production values. The story itself is a lot of fun and some of the dialogues are hilarious at the beginning. The acting of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is fantastic ... especially Stack ... when he smiled my knees weakened! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deservedly won the best supporting actress for her role. She's sexy, violent, mean and understanding ... all convincingly. <br /> <br /> Funny, shiny trash. Not to be missed!
