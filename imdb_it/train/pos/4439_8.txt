The best-selling horror novelist Cheryl (a solid and comprehensive performance of the beautiful Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the sympathetic Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the holiday countryside summer. Local legend states that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a hideous creepy, hairy and ugly (kneeling David Flosi in an extraordinarily horrible costume) who lives in the basement. Cheryl must overcome her fear of the deeply rooted baby beast so she can defeat the phallus found. The director / coauthor Lamberto Bava does an expert job in creating and sustaining a disturbing and disturbing nightmare mood. In addition, Bava avoids the normal "blood'n'guts fright flick" routine in favor of creating a fairy tale and enchanting dark adult tale about how the best way to overcome what scares us is to face the aforementioned source. Sturdy supporting registers of Sabrina Ferilli in the role of teacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi in the role of babysitter Maria, and Alex Serra in the role of the mad painter Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's lucid cinematography boasts few fluid shots and plenty of atmospheric lighting. The gnarly make-up f / x by Fabrizio Sforza, Simon Boswell's splendid spooky sparkling spooky n 'huddery, and the dark, dark, cobblestone basement all hit the spot that crawls the skin. Worth watching.
