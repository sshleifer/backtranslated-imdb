Mahatma was portrayed as a man who neglected his son in this film. Don't get me wrong I'm not condemning the film; it's such a wonderful film and it came out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. We need to understand the spiritual position of Mahatma, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could detach himself from his loved ones. A man with a similar caliber leads his family and his followers by example. According to the film, he spoke with his son and tries to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma remained calm and accepted that his son is a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If they had been other parents, they would have compromised their values ​​to help their child get back on their feet. Mahatma did not do it, he is a true leader who leads by example.
