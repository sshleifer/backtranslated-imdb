I was in France, around March 5, and I love going to this film festival. I knew of this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never went. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The film is gorgeous. It has not caused the impact on me as with the Mexican users, because it was subtitled in French but it is still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire on urban violence, kidnapping and crime in the streets of Mexico. It is a rough portrait of the city. Of a metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a splendid Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnappings, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kind of connection with Cero y van 4. A sort of story of redemption and What is too much? Man on Fire, which was incredibly strong, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrayal in the streets of Mexico. Or is it like The Brave One. A film that hits you and hits you hard. This is like The Usual Suspects, it has some twists, but this makes it even more believable. Verdict: a film that upsets and makes you believe that there is no more security in the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing shows. Cero y van 4 is a film you will not soon forget. It leaves you trembling and dazed.
