Jack Frost is really a fantastic movie. I mean ... it's fun. It's violent. and very pleasant. Most people say it is B nominal, but that could not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good acting. The Only Weird thing of Course, The Killer Snowman. I think this film was actually one of the best films of the late 90s. Most films these days do not have the A Clive Barker Master Piece Criteria. That is, be original and give the viewer what they don't expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Grade: A +. And he also recommends the film Uncle Sam to fans of Jack Frost.
