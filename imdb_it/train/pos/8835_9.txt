An acute political comment that posthumously as a training story is what this film is. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. It is not expected, but it does. This story of four boys and a girl who grew up in 1953, Communist Belgrade, is a warmer heart. This is what the gentlemen call classic cinema. Obviously, in 1953, Belgrade is not a dictatorial and fascist environment as hard as communist society is often described. You can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba" wing the title of the film. But jeans can't be bought, or certain drugs that are illegal. Unlike a heavy criticism of a communist society, this film shows it showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as the four of us. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and her to go outside to join him, the piano that is taken away from the communion by one of the boys, the sudden donation of your home and of your lodgings to your new companions because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to the music and it is clarified that they despise the fascism that communism created while engaging in battles with a fascist charlatan who tattooed Stalin on his hands. All this leads to the actions they take later and to the memory of a time that fades away, given that this film was published in 1986 at the twilight of the Soviet empire. A great movie that is worth reviewing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but it is also nobody's friend."
