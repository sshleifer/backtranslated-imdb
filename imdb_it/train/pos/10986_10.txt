We ran into the documentary, the Gray Gardens, last Sunday and we were "sucked" without warning. All those who entered the room remained fixed on the television and the bewitching images of Edith and Edie that seemed to live their lives practically in a room of a large and dirty beach villa, eating ice cream and cobs (which was cooked on the bedside table) the cat urinating on Edith's bed and her incredible words: "I make money on [the smell]". We had not seen the beginning and we wondered what we were looking at and how these aristocratic women managed to get into the position they were in. Charming! a must see !!!!
