Comment? How is my comment necessary? We are talking about a masterpiece of all times, for all seasons and for all generations. This is just the kind of movie I still have patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney movies, there is a kind of magic. All the characters are somehow "alive" and "real" so it's easy to understand the message, even if you don't understand the language, (as I didn't understand when I saw the film for the first time, because I was about six years old). Perhaps my English is not so good, but I learned what I know most from this type of film, and this is another big dimension of this type of film, which is rare at the moment. But there is a great shame. In my country it is now impossible to watch this, or any other Disney movie! We have no copyright, so our children are disabled to have fun and learn from this type of film. So, we'll watch this movie "Once upon a time a dream" or ... again?
