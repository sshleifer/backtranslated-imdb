Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story. This film has glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is it? In these times of "Heather has two mothers" (or what ever, empty spaces are filled) it's easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. With the father's roles in the foreground, I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga. What a disappointment to have finished it. Each character was important and did a fabulous job playing his role. I would have liked to see every character develop over the years. I loved this movie, it's one I will look at defiantly whenever it's on. Nice story, good acting, and I hope this isn't a spoiler, but no intrusive sex or bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Attention, prepare the Kleenex. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely represented today in our entertainment, be it television or. Movie. Daniell if you're listening, You Go Girl, give us more.
