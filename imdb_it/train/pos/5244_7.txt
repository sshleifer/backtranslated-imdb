"The Ladies Man" suffers from a common problem among movies based on "Saturday Night Live" skits. And that is, a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not go well in ninety minutes. Although this film has its laughter, like Tim Meadows in the role of Leon Phelps, a sex man who came out of the 70s, and Will Ferrell in the role of an iron-obsessed husband lulled by Leon. So this movie is pretty funny, but it's not a "Wayne's World"!
