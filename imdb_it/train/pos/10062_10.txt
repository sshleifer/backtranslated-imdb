Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems that this is the only film written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in him. <br /> <br /> Acting is sublime. Denying Zhou as Doggie was fantastic - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as the old exhausted traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, driving without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only more films like this were made in Hollywood or Hong Kong, a perfect gem, well acted, well written, well directed, suitable for families.
