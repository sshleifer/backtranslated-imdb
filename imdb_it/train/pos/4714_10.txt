Famous words of the foreign owner of the Roman Maroni nightclub, that "lousy cork drinker" who spends the entire film not only as a rival to Johnny Dangerously, but also slaughters the English language. <br /> <br /> Another underrated classic that you can only find in the afternoon afternoons or "Late Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is a terrific satirical success on a good-hearted guy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother at school. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There are too many laughs in this to put here. As an airplane, you have to pay attention or you'll miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
