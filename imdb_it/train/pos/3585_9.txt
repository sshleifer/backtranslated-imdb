An excellent story of teenagers, leaders, "stars" of high school football. How far will you go to protect your friends? Mind, you kill? How much can you lose if you are a prisoner of an innocent girl? Can love beat the odds? Can you defeat the narrow-minded small town people? When your friend scores and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to make them pay, or will you be a man about it, and will he respect his right to choose? Will you rape her and show her how your victory over a "problematic" girl? Can you stand what is just a sin and have a personal opinion, be able to make your own decisions, choose for yourself? It made me think twice before expressing my opinion about who was right and who was wrong, but one is sure: films and very disturbing issues in general. Thumb up!
