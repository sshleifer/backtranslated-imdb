This is one of my favorite Hong Kong martial arts movies. It is one of John Woo's first films and one of the few traditional martial arts films he directed. You can see his influences from working under Chang Cheh in this film. The action is good, the fight choreography is conducted by Fong Hak On who appears as one of the villains in the film. Starring Wei Pei is the fame of "Five Venom" and a series of faces familiar to fans of the productions of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The plot is interesting, there are some decent twists and the accumulation of characters and their relationships are made intelligently. This film only had a VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a Region 3 DVD and there are versions of this DVD available in the United States. The film is nice to see both in the original language and in the English dubbed version. I highly recommend this movie.
