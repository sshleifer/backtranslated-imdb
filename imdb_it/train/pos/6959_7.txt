well, this is a film by Ivan Reitman. with the rare exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are generally not "deep", but they are often quite funny. My ex-girlfriend surprised me that I laughed more than I thought. Uma Thurman is so great and I love her portraits. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a real scream. Not taking itself seriously, the film is exaggerated, yet it is not very unique, nor does it go where no one has ever gone before .... it is a nice rent and probably an OK release film, especially if you have a headache and don't I want to strain your brain. It's fun for evasion and there's nothing wrong with that. When you take away the "super-girl", you have a story about relationships and relationships go wrong. He is a boy who meets a girl, a boy who leaves something for a girl. And in the end, the characters look for love. Not everyone has been "dumped" as they could ... a slice of life with a twist.
