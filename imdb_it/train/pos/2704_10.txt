I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation that this film received. Once again, Billy Zane proves to be much more than a handsome Hollywood guy in a silent performance that combines a spastic slapstick with a discreet pathos. Calling it a silent film is inaccurate, because there is a lot of music and sound. He has a manic rhythm and is full of imaginative inventiveness to which Ed Wood is finally starting to be appreciated. See the list of the cast and realize that all shine. No one is there just to show their face. I think they are all in the film to show their appreciation for Wood, and to do a broad and physical type of acting that you don't see much these days. <br /> <br /> But today the reviewers try to guess what's going to become much more successful than any kind of aesthetic appreciation for a movie. And IWUETDID does not have a perceptible target audience. It was made mainly for the love of Wood's script. Even after his death, the fashionable social parasites dealt him another blow and deprived the world of a minor classic. This is a very funny and very experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
