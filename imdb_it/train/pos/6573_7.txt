The film has the feeling of playing from the beginning - I think it would be a better game than a film because the set and the dramatization make the version of a film a little too artificial. But, again, it is done quite well, and the story and above all the dialogue are interesting. They took the dialogue pretty much exactly as from the real game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's dramas. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a touch for the drama, and the acting of Helena Bonham Carter does a good job here. Her boyfriend, Serges, is a bit too cartoonish when in reality he should be a fascinating and charming figure. His parents are pretty funny.
