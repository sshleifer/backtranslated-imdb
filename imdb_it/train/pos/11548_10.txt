Based on Neil Simons' same drama The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) who end up sharing the Oscar massacre when Felix tries to kill himself. <br /> <He had a big row with his wife for his obsessive compulsive scornful cleansing and strange phobias and he sends her a suicide telegram. Call Oscar and let him know what happened. Felix shows up at Oscar during his weekly poker game with their friends Vinnie (John Fielder) Murray the cop (Herbert Edelman) Roy (David Sheiner) and Speed ​​(Larry Haines). After a bit of hysterical separation, he agrees that Felix will stay with Oscar. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film focuses on how these two characters are completely different. As if Oscar could stand Felix's really strange and unique habits and cleanliness and if Felix could bear that Oscar was so drunk and his relaxed attitude towards everything. Really a film about two complete opposites that live together and the joys, the highs, the lows and the need for the gift that is friendship. With great acting a clever and very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British pigeon sisters whom Oscar invites for a double date. <br /> <br /> This is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are fantastic with a great chemistry. Also turned into a successful and equally entertaining TV series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix .
