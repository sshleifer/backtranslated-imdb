Religious bigotry spreads everywhere. Australia is not immune. <br /> <br /> A dingo kidnapped a child and his mother was tried and sent to prison for "killing" her baby. I don't want to ruin the story for you, but you need to know the basics before delving deeply into what prompted this woman to be in a prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the movie and find out how much the profound human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving film with an exceptional cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with his famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are exceptional. Even those with secondary roles are pretty good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
