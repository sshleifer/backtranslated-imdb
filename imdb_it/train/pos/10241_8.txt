I try not to take the IMDb charts to heart, but I was stunned when I saw the 5.4 rating for one of my childhood favorites. It doesn't impress me so much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well-intentioned film. Children will surely love it and defects will not fail, and adults will be able to guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal message of the film. No one in the film was in any way a preacher, in fact he has a great message that he added to his sweetness. I must admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like the death of Screweyes (which still scares me) can be a bit scary. But the animation is well above average with beautiful colors and good character animation. James Horner's music is very beautiful and the song is memorable, catchy and fun. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most thorough of all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Short's clown was both exhilarating and emphatic, the part where he tells Screweyes "I left!" made me points. My favorite is Screweyes though, an actual villain who is smart and I suppose smart. If nothing else, I would like the film to be kept in the part when it explains how it lost its sight and why it is afraid of crows because in that way it could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, although not worthy of an Oscar, has its fun and exciting parts, and should entertain children and adults. The speaking voice for me was what made the film. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith gave solid performances, but a special mention must go to Kenneth Mars because he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't have the evaluation, honestly no. Sure, this movie isn't perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's very funny. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
