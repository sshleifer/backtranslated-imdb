Last year we were treated with two films about Truman Capote writing the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine a film like this made in 1967. A strong, powerful film and a chilling and brutal drama; raised to the status of a classic film by Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Professional, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Robert Blake, who has starred in this film, has had so many problems in recent times that could be related to his portrait of a killer in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a film that stays with you after watching.
