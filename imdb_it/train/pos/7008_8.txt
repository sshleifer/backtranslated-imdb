WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of contemporary Italian directors at all. I don't usually like dramas. I'm not a super fan of Will Smith, even though I think he's a great actor ...... but this movie! It's such a beautiful film with such an original script and good direction and acting like that ... wow ... it's amazing. This film caught my attention minute by minute and I didn't even like "The pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because I didn't like the acting of Will's son who is a bad actor while the children usually all look like natural actors, I have also saw him last night in "The day the earth stopped" and I confirmed my feeling that Jaden cannot act). I don't want to write spoilers and so I'm not talking about history, but what I can say is that this film is about love, death and other feelings that I don't like watching in movies ... but THIS FILM is a fantastic film. If you have a minimum of heart you will not regret looking at it
