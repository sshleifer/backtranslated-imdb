When I heard that this movie was released the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before seeing the film. I'm sure the film would have been very different for me if I hadn't read the book. The authors actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book, with minor differences, of course. I think the thing that disappointed me most about the movie is Boyle who plays the role of Col. I'm not a big Boyle fan, and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie, she always tries to use it -the slumped lips, dark eyes made up to make it look super sexy. In fact, I think the film is true to the genuine creepiness of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so bizarre that the son was killed in Iraq and in current events there is Casey Sheehan, whose mother made a huge tirade against Iraq). In the book, of course, the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house lights that video of the son in a helicopter, I was really scared. Overall, I was impressed with the film, as it followed the book very well.
