'The Luzhin Defense' is a film worthy of anyone's time. it's a thoughtful and intense film, and it kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender and eccentric chess master, and Emily Watson is an enchantress like the sweet but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is evident from the moment their characters meet in history. All in all, this film is one of the best looks on the life of a great chess master, and Turturro and Watson add an unconventional and non-clich√© feeling to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely love stories.
