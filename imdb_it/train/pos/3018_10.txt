This film is an exception to the rule that a sequel is worse than the original. His comedy at its best. This film is a slapstick comedy of fast action in which something seems to happen every second. On more than one occasion the whole audience laughed out loud at a joke. <br /> <br /> It is a great advantage to have seen the first movie, but it is not a requirement. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody of the last TV series of reality production as a survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for the Swedish public. So don't see it if you're not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: have fun! Johan
