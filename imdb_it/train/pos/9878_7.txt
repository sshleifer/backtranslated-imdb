almost every review of this movie I saw was pretty bad. It's not bad, it's actually pretty good, though not exceptional. The character of Judy Garland could have been annoying, but she didn't allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a gloomy, overbearing, exaggerated Van Heflin fan, at least in the early 1940s. Judy's singing is great, but the film missed an excellent opportunity by not showing their relationship. I gave a 7.
