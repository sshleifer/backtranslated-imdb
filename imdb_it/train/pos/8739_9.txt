This is a FUN movie. It has all the usual Disney components (music, great variety of characters, history, charm), intertwined with superb animation and the excellent vocal talent of lesser known actors such as those who recite "Antz" and "Price of Egypt". <Br /> <br /> The characters work really well and have a strong appeal, and the humor is aimed at a wide level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times, and I intend to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and have not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that no one has ever left this film without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Watch it and don't be discouraged because it's animated. You're sure to enjoy this movie and make sure you stay for the credits! Bloopers and out-takes are the funniest part of the film, which is full of laughter.
