That movie was awesome! I can't get past his songs. I think I'm a little too old for musicals, but that movie deserves some credit here, guys! My particular favorite was Jack Wild. I, being a lover of British actors, cannot keep from all those new looking and nice looking young men. I never knew that when Jack was doing that movie he was sixteen! He looks like an 11 year old. It's low, that's what helps. Try to post your answers, your poster colleagues, so that I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think the drone look is really familiar. Any idea where he played first? If so, post, I'd really like to know.
