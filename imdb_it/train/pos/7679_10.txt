I chose to do human trafficking for my fourth school project for the humanities. After some internet research, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow". It's a compelling story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric trying to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and even if it's not a happy ending, it's very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and for what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!
