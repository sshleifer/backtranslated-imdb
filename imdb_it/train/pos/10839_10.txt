I saw this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed ourselves so much that we bought the VHS and have had fun since then. <br /> <br /> The plot has been well discussed, so there's no need to see it again. The point is that this film deserves repeated views. The Americans, in particular, will not take all the lines for the first time. I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast to his daughter's wedding, it's indecent. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" while trying to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've ever heard in years. I was dancing in the living room in "All the world". <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightly complimented on his portrait of Ray, a man who had a bad trip. Stephen Rea is as perfect as Tony, the amiable keyboard player who held a torch for Karen all these years. It has a captivating look that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore all the pots you read about this movie and watch it. It is a gem.
