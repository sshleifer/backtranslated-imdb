I saw this movie for the first time years ago and I kept seeing it several times a year when I get the chance. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. If someone tells you it's silly or obsolete, ignore them ... this movie is for everyone who likes to laugh and listen to music. Dance is not as important in this film as it is in other Astaire films, so the comedy and the acting shine. See this movie if you can, it may be light but it's still completely fun. So I know a lot of people hate black and white movies, they think old movies can't be really fun, this movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without being in the least amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He could be a great performer and capable singer, but he is not charming and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy becomes a bit clich√© at times, but the vaudevillesque performances of G burns and G Allen are perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs. Giving this movie a chance even if you don't like old movies, this movie can appeal to ridicule in anyone.
