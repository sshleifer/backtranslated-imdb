If you didn't like this movie, you're dead, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, which gave all good performances. This film showed that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what the critics say. Adam Sandler is becoming a highly respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, then he made a couple of bad films, then he broke through with an outstanding performance in 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, then Click, and now Reign Over Me. <br /> < br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing to the family he has is a mother-in-law and father-in-law. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) came across him, he seems to turn his life around. I won't say anything else, because I don't want to ruin the film, but I highly recommend this movie. One of the best films of 2007.
