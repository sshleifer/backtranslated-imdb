This is an excellent film. The cast is a great mix of characters and the plot is decent. The film basically talks about a well-made doctor who steals the bodies of dead wives and takes them to his home. Once the bodies are at his home, he removes things (I hate to use such a general term, but I forget what he removed) and marries him to maintain his youth. Then a journalist, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find the answers as to why the brides are dying. Take a trip to the doctor and interesting things begin to take place. Surely you look at this old man, but if possible you can do it.
