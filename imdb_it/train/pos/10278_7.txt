"House Of Games" is certainly not without flaws - holes in the plot, stiff acting, final scenes - but they do little to diminish the fun of watching a thriller that so systematically merges with your head. "House Of Games" does almost everything a good thriller should do. Obviously, this is not a huge undertaking since we are dealing with the world of men of trust and the disadvantages they perpetrate. So it's obvious that we never really know what's going on, even if we think we do it. But this is what makes the film worthy of note for those at stake; a film for which repeated views are instead indulgences if necessary. <br /> <br /> It has a precise Hitchcock cut. The film is based on some similar themes that found its "Marnie" effort of 1964, considered a bonfire when it was released, but now considered one of the Master's most inspiring works. One could easily consider the idea that Lindsay Crouse's character is the same as Tippi Hedrin's ... maybe ten years later. Both are strong-willed solitaires, both with compulsive behaviors that force them to walk too close to the shark pool. While the repressed and repressed character of Crouse says "What is life without adventure?" Put your Reality Check on a low level and enjoy swimming with the sharks!
