It's time for Hollywood to sit down and take notice! If actors act haughty, all you have to do is get the animators who worked on this little wonder. The Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget you're not seeing human beings. Although the cast voiceovers (Craig, McCormack, Pryce etc.) are among the best I've ever heard, even then the emotions portrayed by the "cartoons" are unnerving. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of lights and shadows makes the film a living painting. Ironically, this magical technique makes you forget that this is indeed a very beautiful film. The rhythm and the development of the plot are wonderful and the dialog boxes are sharp. <br /> <br /> Plot: the disappearance of a mega corporation employee reveals a story of deception and corruption with a cold-hearted hero at the helm. I can't say much without giving up everything ... except that while the film keeps you on the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> A must watch..even for the 'adults' who smile at the "cartoons"
