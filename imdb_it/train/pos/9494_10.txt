WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVDs and on VHS. He stated that he is one of the most fun and fantastic low-budget actors ever made. Generally I don't watch movies knowing they will be bad, but I made an exception for that ... and I was very glad I did. <br /> <br /> It is filled to the brim with action (largely surprisingly, graphically bloody), sleaze (isolated from nudity with a key female character, but there is so much of it in a scene that becomes hilarious) and an outrageously embarrassing dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Ginty, THE EXTERMINATOR's unusual-looking star (and countless other low-budget action turds) is fun to command, giving the best performance he has managed to get. Williamson is better than usual, clearly recovering it with an unprecedented joy (and does not reach half way). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the bad guys, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that seems to be a mixture of Spanish and Italian. It is priceless. <br /> <br /> Once again, I can't stress enough how gory it was. It is not so bloody that it is sickening, but it is unusually violent, in part with some turbulent fleshy ones that explode in the clashes and has a tortuous sequence of tortures that no man will soon forget. Furthermore, when Ginty is swarmed by a bunch of bad guys, he easily gets hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that will follow will all have all the action fans who will greet and pour their beers. <br /> <br /> Don I miss you WHITE FIRE. It's a classic of action, though incredibly stupid.
