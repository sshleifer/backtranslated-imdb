This film was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is something to do. I thought Joe Johnston was a bizarre choice as a director, as he is usually associated with big budget successes (Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids). Throw every scene with pure class. My favorite scene was one in which Homer came down from the well and looked at the sky, coming down, like all his dreams, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant acting films and his great big-budget fiction, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! to all those involved in this masterpiece!
