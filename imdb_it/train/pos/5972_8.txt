No one said that the films had to be realistic, did they? I really enjoyed this film because I remember when I saw it for the first time in junior high. For all the children who remember the PMRC and the albums before there were warning stickers, it's a good story for all those kids who were part of the headbanger crowd between the mid and late 80s.
