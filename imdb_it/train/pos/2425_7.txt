I took this film on IFC and had fun, although I felt that the editing work was a bit rough, even though it could have been intentional. I had a bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for some non-linear Pulp Fiction plot presentation. He seemed a little forced though. I certainly think it's worth watching the movie, but I think he could have used a bit of cleaning. Some scenes don't seem to make sense after the others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the rating here so low. It is not exceptional, but it does not have very serious problems. I gave a 7/10. The film has at least shown that Laurence Fishburne can act whenever he wants. They must have just told him not to get into the Matrix movies.
