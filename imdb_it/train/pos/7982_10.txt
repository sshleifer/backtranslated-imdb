I am surprised that films like this can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. I never thought that a 146 minute movie could make me think about it. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a former washed-out counterterror agent who is taken for the bottle. Once he was assigned to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive arc began in the way that only an adorable child can provide. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by thugs, and Creasy decides that much of Mexico City has to pay the price for daring to take away the catalyst that holds its teddy bear. Yes, he became ... a man turned on. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie.
