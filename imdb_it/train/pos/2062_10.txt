First of all I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a bit exaggerated. A less acrobatic, less dejected scarecrow would have made this film less banal. But overall I think it's one of the best B-movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to say incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks the all-important nude factor, there are many other films in which to see it. But here he gets all the wickedness, especially towards the end as he moves away from the swallowed scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a great job as a sheriff and a drunk guy. Yes, it's a low budget B movie. But of all those I've seen, this is definitely one of my favorites.
