"Dressed to Kill" is the best film by Brian DePalma, an absolute ride of suspense, humor and style that is unrivaled today. DePalma has a bad joke in Hollywood, as most people say he tears off Alfred Hitchcock. He does not. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the uncut original version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy issued by Goodtimes is the cut R approved by Jack Valenti. But some copies of DePalma's original cut still exist. It is the one distributed by Warner Home Video, both in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, and in a black shell case with the theatrical poster on a silver lining. These are the ones to get if you can find a copy. I have the green one and it is among my precious assets. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's get back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for her obsessive fantasies. During a trip to the museum (a real tour-de-force for DePalma in terms of photographic work and suspense), Miller is captured by a stranger. You can pretty much guess what happens to her, since the ads and art boxes give away the story. But there are some complications. A prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son, Peter (Keith Gordon), is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. And Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message about it ... on a missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I'm not ruining the movie for you at all, since what I described above is plays inside the half hour and the biggest surprises of DePalma are reserved for the last hour. This film is explicit, however, enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to ask for cuts in the film. What surprises me are the cuts he wanted. Several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two sharp scenes and some of Nancy Allen's dialogues (Valenti wanted the "cock" to have changed to "bulge"). This is a very violent and bloody film, yet the objections concern the sexual content. I'd like to hear Valenti's explanations of how seeing two women in a tender love scene in "Lost and Delirious" is somehow more damaging to a young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger blowing away people with a chain gun. It's not right. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to Kill" so good is that not only technical credits are top notch, but performance is also very good. Michael Caine, who was in a lot of shit during this time, gives one of his best performances as the doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps because she really has an important role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her range of shows that consider her one of the most underrated and neglected actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is as wonderful as a genius and I loved all his inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. The recent joke on the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is. If they actually open their eyes for once, they would see that DePalma set up his thriller career and is actually the best craftsman. This is even better than "Psycho". It is a pity that few actually know this. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
