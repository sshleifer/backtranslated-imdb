What would happen if a G.I. from the Japanese army was sent back in the time of 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa shogunate? Great shot true? The film does exactly what it says on the pond. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the writers did not bother to explain the usually ridiculous science fiction film, the scientific transportation of mumbo jumbo of the time. No how it goes or why. They just did. However, the transport time sequence is in itself triumphant and very beautiful, if not a little dated. It is not as foolish as one might imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows the premise at a T. But as it loses some steam with the various subplots that follow the arrival of the GIs in medieval Japan, it collects with a devastating battle sequence. Undoubtedly it is the main order of the day. The entire concept and, by extension, the film itself, was probably originated from this simple intonation: what would have happened if the G.I. were they equipped with the latest modern wars to fight the samurai? And the boy delivers it. <br /> <br /> The main battle sequence that spans over half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in the action / war movies of the 70s. Not only is it relentless and exhausting in terms of rhythm and length, but it is also a formidable mixture of styles and techniques that only the unique premises like G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else would you have the chance to show tanks, ninjas complete with shurikens, a helicopter and samurai in the same shot? The G.I. the platoon led by Lieutenant Iba literally tears up hundreds of extras, hurling them with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mixture of styles is with a foot firmly rooted in the epic jidai geki by Kurosawa Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners, while the other is in action and war westerns. There are stylistic touches (such as the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring to mind Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari in Keoma. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood operas and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turns this mixture of east-west-west into an exciting film. <br /> <br /> The directors really thank the whole thing and the film benefits immensely. Not that the ironic mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to satisfy the bad public who loves to laugh at their own movies. The budget was probably high, as is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. The camera and editing are all top notch, almost a film that has no superior artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Of course it is not without its flaws. There are many scenes of "songs", in which every kind of rock music, disco and Japanese country from the 70s plays on montages (there is a bonding scene, a scene of love interest, a "war scene" is a hell "etc.). The songs themselves are rather lame and trivial and distract the whole thing. Even if it runs for an hour and a half, most of the time it flies like a bullet. Still some scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first time could have been cut for a narrower effect. <br /> <br /> The cast also deserves a mention, with such important names as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all hit the right notes.
