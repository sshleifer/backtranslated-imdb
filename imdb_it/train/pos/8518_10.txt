I met this movie at the local video store during their annual sidewalk sale. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find some movies of cartoons for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand working for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a group of brothers of three adopted children (and they will soon be adopted) who live with my family. My adoptive children immediately bonded with the three children who acted in the film. The film helped them better understand their circumstances. For the first time, too, the eldest of the group of brothers (7 years / female) decided to open up a bit about his past and the trauma he had experienced. He fought the whole problem of trust. This is also the first time I've seen her cry. After watching the film, I asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted. She replied, "It means being happy." To see for families who are promoting children and are considering adoption. He certainly opened the lines of communication with us.
