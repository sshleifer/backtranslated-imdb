I first saw the film when it landed on the American cable a year after it came out. It blew my head off, I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I had heard, having been a strictly folk, classical, grown up girl. Music mesmerized me, as well as the astonishing look of Hazel O'Connor and her charismatic vocal performances, and the hard but soft manager of Phil Daniels' Cock Dani just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's spicy sax player. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic, he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the performance when the lights went out, and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the movie is not the rose! But it was really excellent for his limited budget and his portrait of Britain in the early 1980s, exploding with young rebels, looking for a way out of the dole's tail. I went to Britain just a couple of years later and found the film very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, look at it. It's a fantastic film, with some wonderful performances, and the music will leave you speechless. <br /> <br />
