For the longest time, I liked this movie better than the original movie Care Bears. Well, last summer, I saw them together and decided I was wrong. The first is a Best Care Bears movie (as you might have guessed if you read my review for this). This is not a BAD movie, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, as some people have mentioned, it completely denies any knowledge of the first film. I can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so explicitly (especially with the sex of some characters and how they all met). When I was a child and watched this, I was a little confused and upset. I thought the same way to see him as an adult! <br /> <br /> The reasons why the film is actually pretty good (if you dissociate it from the first movie). I can't think of another movie for children with DEMON since it's villan! Now I am not suggesting for a minute that the evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and Care Bears are good, I find it nice that there is a EVENT IN A movie for small children! It's like that bizarre movie "Santa Clause vs. Satan" from Mexico that you sometimes hear about. <br /> <br /> In any case, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him receive the Care Bears in exchange for his special power. Very dark for a kiddy movie eh? And did I mention that Darkheart appears to the girl more often as an OLD OLD OLD AGE BOY WON ??? Freaky! Meanwhile, some other children are in Care-a-Lot to look after BABY CARE BEARS! Oh God! Demons and Baby Care Bears IN THE SAME FILM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say that in the end everything is clarified (but not before seeing Darkheart trap the souls of the Care Bears in this scary chandelere thing in a [surprisingly] profoundly disturbing scene). But the question remains whether this film has found the cult audience that deserves so much. I could just watch it myself again.
