Simon Pegg plays a rude and often out-of-control celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work for a major American magazine. Of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications. A fun comedy based on the participation of Kristen Dunst (who looks pretty grown up), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We understand perfectly why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent mistakes. I liked the movie. It's not all and it ends, but it was a nice way to celebrate an evening sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
