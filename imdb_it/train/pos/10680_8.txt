As almost always happens, when Great Britain offers a show of sit-coms or fun and / or successful quizzes, the Yanks will come and face the format and produce their coarsely inferior version. Man About The House, of course, is no exception to this rule. Yanks (Three's Company) version was unwatchable, braindead dad who seems to work forever. A prime example of quantity beyond quality (non-existent). The original, on the other hand, is a gem remembered with affection that had the good sense (like Fawlty Towers) to pull the plug at exactly the right time (unlike the 637 episodes of "hilarity" that Three's Company invented ). Jo was cute, there was a brilliant chemistry among the Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made it all so simple, the screenplays, while not exactly in Oscar Wilde's standard, were definitely amusing and Chrissy was THE most beautiful dead woman who walked the face of this planet since the Dead Sea was not feeling well. Nuff said.
