"Love in the Time of Money" by Petter Mattei is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a film that seems to tell us what money, power and success they make to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> Being a variant of the Arthur Schnitzler comedy on the same theme, the director transfers the action to New York, where all these characters meet and connect. Everyone is connected in one way or another to the next person, but nobody seems to know the previous point of contact. Elegantly, the film has a luxurious and sophisticated look. We are led to see how these people live and the world in which they live in their habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing you get from all these souls in the image are the different stages of solitude in which everyone lives. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relations find true fulfillment, as we realize most of the people we meet. <br /> <br /> The acting is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come to life. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and look forward to his next job.
