So, I finally know it exists. Along with the other UK contributors here I saw this on MUST BE which is only the projection of the United Kingdom in the 1970s. I remembered the title, but I didn't get anywhere when I mentioned it to people. It scares me (it's the 2'r's) but when you sleep with death darting over your brain and you're listening all around for the looming terror, then isn't that what a TRULY CLASSIC horror movie is? I can barely remember the complexity of the film, but what I remember is my trembling flesh and intense senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is in black and white? Again, if anyone has any information on how to get a copy of this, please get in touch ...
