The Waiting Womans Ward of a large reclining hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIVES STARTS. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a small soap opera, full of comedy and tragedy, all tied to the life of maternity staff and their patients. The frankness with which the subject is treated traces the pre-code status of the film. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Aline MacMahon, as the sympathizing nurse, is the calm center of the film, the rock around which all the current flows. Able to handle any crisis or emergency, it is the best, sometimes the last, friend of the mother. Nearby MacMahon is a swarm of excellent costar: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as his scared young husband; the blonde Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother for her sixth childbirth; Preston Foster and Hale Hamilton as caring and compassionate doctors and Frank McHugh as a comically frantic future father. <br /> <br /> Film critics will recognize Bob Watson as a tiny tyke who wants to see the Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as a distraught Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a contemptuous wife of a doctor interested in adopting Farrell's son - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> There are some absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously too old; Farrell becomes openly drunk in the ward, but none of the staff seems to notice; an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but this does nothing but improve the eccentric entertainment value of the film and prevents things from becoming too serious.
