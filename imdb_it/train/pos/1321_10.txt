Beat a path for this important documentary that seems an interesting feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's Forbidden Love book, and THAT was a best-seller. An onion peeling of literary frauds and a beautiful woman, Lie $ is the best TV of editorial reality. <br /> <br /> Expertly modified and colored, Broinowski's narrative is divided into animated sections by Norma Khouri which significantly blows smoke. I disagree (with Variety) that it is too long; instead my only small problem was with the episodic nature of its key actors who commented on the newly recorded testimonies of others. On a single look your sense of narrative becomes bogged down ..... so I looked at it twice. <br /> <br /> This effort worthy of Oscar is at the same time really funny, shocking and totally compelling as it documents a lie after another. The apparent conflict took place in the Australian state of Queensland through very personal scams of Khouri friends and fans (!). Clearly these friends are now "transformed", the funniest camera line belonging to Khouri's nearby QLD, Rachel Richardson, who talks about her disillusionment in colloquial and meaningless terms: "I think it's a load of sh! T. Personally". /> <br /> We need to learn from their experience, so I believe in spoilers. Any perennial spinner of lies caught in a lie will say anything to buy time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There is some breathtaking footage of Khouri screaming in a derisive way to deceive this documentarian, who instead repeatedly presses his (con) "Artist" for corroboration. <br /> <br /> Since being caught by Sydney Morning Heraldists journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after the publication, Khouri has been on the run, but he was tempted by the director to presumably delete his name. She allegedly fled because a) she is terrified of her crafty husband, more Italian-from Greek than Greek, or b) because she needs her passport / visa to cancel her name. <br /> <br /> Unlikely. <br /> <br /> A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained its footsteps in Queensland before it again jumped overseas (a hypothesis: No, not Jordan). According to a final paper, Khouri is "still under investigation by the FBI" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I guessed that the public could only give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once he invoked the need for maximum secrecy and subterfuge. Instead, the audience I sat with slowly became as disillusioned as the deceived people on the screen. Once they got caught, there was a lot of contrasts and whistles; before, stressed sighs were emanating from members of the public who didn't know how to take Khouri's evolving contradictions. <br /> <br /> The director gets props so wonderfully that they embrace this twisted story from beginning to end, leaving nothing out - it's not even his own sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with a nice narration of Khouri's own book. The reason it is proposed is very credible in the beginning - the key to how a permanent liar operates: in half truths. Khouri is still a very nice and intelligent 35-year-old with a rather disarming charm, and surprisingly, an elaborate bicep. <br /> <br /> Gradually we are introduced to less-and-less-flattering Australian magazines, publishers and fans who at first bought the extension of Khouri's hook killing accusations, hook, line and platinum. Later we see their most painful reactions, quite self-controlled and concrete, if some are perhaps a little bitter. <br /> <br /> It was Jordanian (anti-) activists who killed the honor Khouri's mistakes because their agitation forced them to reduce the pace of change. Honor killings happen in Jordan; it is only their prevalence that is in contrast to Khouri's book - in addition to 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists faxed (Australian) Random House with 73 carefully controlled objections. <br /> <br /> The publishers of all 4 continents who took the opportunity to publish the author for the first time Khouri have never tried to check facts. Leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their copyright contract, they too were a fair game. So a massive hot topic fraud was easy to perpetrate on the world like typing it in Internet cafes. <br /> <br /> Later we are still shocked to discover that "factual errors" extend to Khouri's biography as well. For one thing, not only is she not a 35-year-old virgin (her defense is that she simply didn't disappoint people about their assumptions), but she has a perfect husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes he speaks too fast in his American accent. He also seems too comfortable with cell phone technology and western clothes. I realize that observations like these might seem detrimental to Jordanian women who do not need any Western paternalism on my part, but when even cultural signals don't jibe in addition to Khouri's "facts", you have to start questioning the your source. <br /> <br /> At some point the director came to the same conclusion. He makes an admirable effort to keep Khouri in person, in Jordan. The last third is consumed with a return trip to Amman, where one "fact" after another falls. Eventually Broinowski forces her (with) "Artist" to admit the ten-year discrepancy in her story, and after that Khouri records her derisory secret confession in her digital camera. Secret, because in it "the American security guard" of Khouri is heard to say that he has an Australian accent: he is an actor! (We will never find out how Anna discovered it.) <br /> <br /> So this becomes the director's triumph, as he never emphasized his tone or commitment. His camera revelations lead his audience to learn from the errors of other data such a litany of reasonable doubt, FBI documents - and Khouri's most shocking initial crime. <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski (see how she is now) is even smart enough to use the only artistic device (key players cross-comment on the shoot) to kill two birds - making her audience want to drink from the same well again. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite his deceptively demure approach, he made me reaffirm that Overington and Knox really won the 2004 Walkley in Investigate Journalism for their "Norma Khouri Investigation". <br /> <br /> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
