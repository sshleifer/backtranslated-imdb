I adore occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, which made one of his greatest films with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), proved more than capable in this field of Horror. This occult tenth episode of Hammer's TV series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss", is actually a disturbing story in the series. The director Don Sharp, who previously enriched the opera Hammer with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and also directed two films "Fu Machu" with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the best known names among the directors of HHH, and he also delivers here. Antiques dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious old sparkling glass. Scrying glass seems to be the object of desire for a devil worshiping cult, which wants to use it for their satanic rituals. When he repairs a beautiful girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who must be sacrificed by the cult, Michael finds himself in the deepest trouble with the cult and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... While this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best is clearly the brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), is very disturbing and suggestive. The plot has several interesting twists and remains suspicious and disturbing throughout the film. Ray Lonnen is a good protagonist, the young Rosalyin Landor is as convincing as the innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly disturbing as the leader of the Satanists. Overall, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and creepy HHH story, and my fellow Hammer fans shouldn't miss it.
