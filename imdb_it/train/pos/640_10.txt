my sister and I saw the premiere last night ... it was so beautiful that we were stuck for the whole thing .. hahaha ... I think I'm passionate about the season !! .... they have really good actors in this thing ... the head coach and the player who likes the pete were very good and the plot has already conquered me but I don't really understand how they will continue to do it for a whole season. probably there will be some big rounds like this ... I can't wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sumpter who is he? I can say it's going to be great !! he was so good that we fell in love with his character right away ... I can't wait for the next episode ... GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
