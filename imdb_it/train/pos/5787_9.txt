Much is dated in this episode (just like most of the Twilight Zone episodes), like the incredibly sexist military "uniform" of the Woman. And some things are so incredible, like the easy availability of clean water. However, consider the year in which it was made and the time, and you quickly understand why this episode is so special while you watch. It has a nice sense of hope, something missing from many Twilight Zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely talks), another rare thing about the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, can offer more excitement and drama than most two-hour movies today. And it's nice to see two people who have become American icons so early in their careers.
