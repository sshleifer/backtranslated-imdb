I think people are considering this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror movie that is set up to scare us and keep us from getting some sleep. That if he tried to do it, he deservedly got a 1/10, but I saw this movie with some friends and we found it very funny and even though it was a good film, after all he has Stephanie beaton. This is why I think it deserves 10/10 for the sheer fun of the film. <br /> <br /> The general view of this film is that it has a bad acting, a simple script that at 10 years old could produce and that cannot be taken seriously and people rank it down because of this . But I see this as a completely entertaining masterpiece ... which has a hilarious and funny script made even more fun by the actors and although not very serious it is very funny.
