This movie is fantastic. Finally well-written characters that you can love for all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is completely hysterical in this shy role. I think it's the best thing I've ever done. He held other roles that showed nuances of being capable of this type of work in its own right, but this role finally gave him the chance to run with it. I almost died when he walked through the hotel lobby wearing underwear and boots. Also Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a couple to aspire, as well as aspiring actors. Kinnear is so nice that his turn in the end is really rewarding. From good actors to actors to play with and give us something extra.
