I took this movie by chance on a cable in the middle and I had to rent it to see it in its entirety and I'm glad I did. I was immediately drawn to the plot and cared for the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends from childhood, take a school trip and are greeted by a swindler named Nick who puts them in serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring. Taken into custody, the girls learn to cope with their imprisonment as they try to find a way out of their problems. All that they try to help themselves is not up to par when the Thai judicial system shows deficiencies and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their American lawyer "Yankee Hank". Hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's native Thai wife smells a rat in the case and does some further research work on foot and discovers that the girls were indeed victims. The end of the film when Alice makes a disinterested act to save Darlene (Beckinsale) made me cry. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
