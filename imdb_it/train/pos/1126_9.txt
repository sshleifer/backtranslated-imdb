My interest was raised as I was leafing through and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia so I thought OK, let's see what it is. I'm so happy to have stayed on the canal. What a wonderful and wonderful story. Drama, sadness, a little exaggerated but a wonderful time to be had. I look at it and this makes me sad for all the drivel that the film industry highlights and these splendid little gems are handed down. Let me try Iphigenia and hope you like it as much as I do. I even had my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. Start off slow, however, the drama is built and you will be drawn to the story. Watching this good movie made me want to wrap myself in Greece more tragedy and pathos.
