Kurt Russell is so believable and the action so continuous that he wants to think about it later to realize that there have been honest for good important issues [overcoming the fear of the stranger, learning to overcome the first conditions, the strength he loves and friendship can bring, etc. in the plot. This is very rare for an action movie of a guy who also [who thinks A / A is a violent dad] liked the movie and recommended it to all the guys I know ..... it's a unfortunate that this was ignored because by right it should have been one of the biggest successes of the action-adventure box office - it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing moments of action almost without rest. I'm afraid the answer is not guilty that the adults didn't go to see it. Anyone under the age of 20 probably did not only see a more violent action in his video games, but he probably would not take multi-level and multi-thematic beauty or he would not care. This film could convert anyone who avoids A / A as senseless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or hires her or sees her on a cable list] to watch this movie, she'll be much more likely to take her to go with him on other action movies.
