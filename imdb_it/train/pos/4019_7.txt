Being that I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, this made me even more anxious to take a look at this movie. I remember being interviewed on "Jay Leno" and stated that he had turned down a role in the big-budget comedy Adam Sandler "The Longest Yard" in this film. So obviously Snoop was on a serious mission to prove he had acting ribs. I do not intend to overproduce Snoop for his performance in "The Tenants". There are certainly better rappers / actors, like Mos Def, who could have done more with his role. But the point is that Snoop has done a "good" job. It seems he can't shake off some of his characteristic body movements and vocal inflections, but it's something that even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing. The point is that I found the role convincing, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character was appealing. McDermott, by the way, offers the best interpretation of the film, although his acting will most likely be overshadowed by the not-too-subtle acting of Snoop. Being a great reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help but find the characters and the somewhat fascinating plot. I was irritated by the way Snoop's character constantly asked McDermott to read his work and scolded him for criticizing him. But you know what? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character had to be imperfect, like McDermott's, in his own way. My only mild criticism of the film would be its end. For some reason, he seemed too rushed for me, even though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than by the plot.
