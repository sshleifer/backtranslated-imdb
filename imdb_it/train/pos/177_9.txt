This is a good film and nothing more. And for that, it's a lot of fun to watch. Of course it touches on political issues. But then what? I'm sure he wasn't trying to do "Good Night and Good Luck" here. We don't try to make it anything other than what it is ... light meals. <br /> <br /> And very funny! <br /> <br /> Do we remember what 1984 was like? We have become very sophisticated according to the media regarding what we watch or not. I tend to differ on this point. Goldie knew it was fun, and she went ahead and did it. <br /> <br /> Like its lighter fare: Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, It seems like the old days, It plays badly, Death becomes his, First Wives Club and the remake of Out- of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what he's doing ... he plays every role for the field you can get from it! Goldie knows herself really well and knows what she can do really well. <br /> <br /> It always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and everything I've ever been to. He has never tried to be anything other than who he is ... and he is that bubbling, giggling girl who seems to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always leave me fascinated and remind me that life is rather short and you just have to enlighten yourself because you know it first ... you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of the inevitable ailments of life. If it arrives so late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovely comic actress.
