hello .. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, it's a tense psychological thriller with excellent cast performances, in particular Connery..it also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good in this .. He also has one of the best scenes in the movies of all time, when Sean interviews the character of Ed Harris in prison is just fantastic .. I liked this a lot and I can't recommend him enough, I really don't miss this! Don't pay attention to the negative reviews that claim that the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the film, I really find Just Cause a very funny movie ..
