At the risk of sounding a little sacrilegious, at first glance I am inclined to put it on a par with "Shaun of the Dead". Now, since I consider Simon Pegg an unquestionable comedy genius, I realize that this is a rather big request. And to what extent you agree with that last statement could be a good preliminary measure if you like "Fido". <br /> <br /> In a way the comedy picks up where "Shaun" left off, except for us. I'm back in the stereotypical stereotypical Middle Eastern town of the 50s from the Living Dead era. The Zombie Wars are over and the zombies themselves are becoming more well-adapted and useful members of the community. This, so we are informed at the beginning, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people of Zomcom - maybe a nice game of romantic comedies? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in the depiction of a respectable neighborhood that maintains fundamental values ​​while creating a place for the zombies and the special dangers they represent. The charm and the balance with which he does it is quite near perfect. The themes you might expect from a more widespread kitsch comedy are: the veneer of a good clean life, the maintenance of appearances, the repressed emotion, the confused parental values, the social decorum and the difficult condition of the alienated individual . <br /> <br /> a story told with a happy heart and a great charm that is vividly made alive by the cast of the all-round cast. It is one of those jobs where it really shows that everyone involved has been excited to participate. It's also fun to imagine that Billy Connelly has learned to learn his script ... <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, chances are you'll appreciate the humor of this movie unless your father tries to eat you.
