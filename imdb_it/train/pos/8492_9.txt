Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never tire of watching. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and he's absolutely funny in this movie. Accompanying him step by step is Gedde Watanabe. The two work wonderfully together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like showing Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) who fight in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, and then finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First, they are both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps into a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. The struggle then spills from the office to the factory. I like that after they've been separated from the workers, you can say that they both feel bad for letting things escape so easily. Also, there is a scene where you can see the influence Hunt had on Kazihiro. He is at home and his boss comes from Japan and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: why not? Kazihiro: the factory is blocked and we can't find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can't imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it's really fun, and it also shows how radically different people can't just learn from each other, but also become good friends.
