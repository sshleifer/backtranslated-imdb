"El Mar", directed by the Catalan director Agusti Villarona and based on the novel by Blai Bonet, offers a glimpse of Spanish history as seen by an author from the Balearics who brings the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country. The film focuses on three friends and follows them from those early days during the start of the war in Mallorca, until a few years later when two of those friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium, lost in the countryside. > <br /> First we meet three guys who are playing happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them indicates the cruelty of one who commits evil. The boys excluded a girl, of their age, from taking part in their games. <br /> <br /> When we meet the Ramallo adult again, he is going to a sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, even Manuel Tur, one of his childhood friends, is treated and the girl who was not accepted to participate in their games is now one of the sisters who oversee their health care. It is obvious that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that just means he is in love with the tough bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a good job of portraying the older Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable young woman. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, introduces herself as Carmen, the wife of the custodian of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows Agusti Villarona's talent for making the novel alive for the viewer.
