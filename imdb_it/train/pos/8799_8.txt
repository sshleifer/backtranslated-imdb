the film is fantastic, like any other international project that includes strong impressions. three of them (Israel, Bosnia and Egypt) should have been cut. especially the Bosnian clip, which is pathetic beyond all reason, and does not contain a single original thought or element about it. everything else is truly exceptional, unrecognizable to most Americans, known to the rest of the world. unfortunately, the clips speak of the misery of people all over the world. and, as far as I can see, there are so many of those who don't give a damn ... <br /> top 5: 1. loach 2. penn 3. inarritu 4. lalouche 5.
