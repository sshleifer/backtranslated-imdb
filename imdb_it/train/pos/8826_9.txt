If you are amused by concrete facts that are logical in a given illogical situation, you will have fun with this 8 minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems ordinary, but the contender, the clients and two musicians seem somewhat oddly subdued. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and a man starts singing the title song, dancing on the tables with musical gestures comedies. The clients, at first motionless, at intervals sing (badly but passionately) with phrases of the song, they read from sheets of paper in their palms. They jump up and out and rise (awkwardly but seriously) in choreographed movements, like the reserve singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman wonders. The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's tied to his chest - just before the explosive climax ... <br /> <br /> Even if you don't take the lyrics (probably ironic) , the perfect performances should give you a smile and a laugh ... I'd like to see it again!
