Skip McCoy is a three-bit slut, unable to restrain her instincts on the street, takes Candy's bag on a subway train. What he does not realize is that Candy carries top secret microfilm, a microfilm that is of great interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller has created an exceptional drama set in the underworld underworld of New York City. Communist spies and shady government agents come together to make Pickup On South Street a compelling vision from the first minute to the last. Based on a story by Dwight Taylor called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller has thrilled this adaptation with a heavy political agenda, something that at the time many thought was over, but focusing only on his anti-communist orientations is doing him a great disservice. /> <br /> Digging a little deeper and finding intriguing characters like those that Fuller directed, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a con man and a superficial human being, his heroisms are not born from love for his country, they were born from his pure and simple strip. It is quite a result that Fuller created one of the best anti-heroes of the 1950s, and I'm sure he was very grateful to Richard Widmark's performance as McCoy, all his grin and his cold heart, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and is the heart of the film. However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter to take the honors of acting, her Moe is as strong and unkempt as the surrounding characters, but there is a weary heat that Ritter transmits majestically. <br /> <br /> It's a B movie in large format but a movie in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10
