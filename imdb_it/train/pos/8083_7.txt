If you've read the books, forget the characters Tolkien built in your head. The representation of hobbits, dwarves, etc. He had the "disney" treatment. Dark riders are excellent, and as I had always imagined in books. <br /> <br /> Kinematically this is an excellent film, which mixes live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. I only wish that he (Bakshi) had been given the money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It is worth having the video, since it will be worth a little after the Lord of the Rings of 2001 !!
