It is difficult for me to criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture does. It radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Nevertheless, yes, the plot was predictable. I think maybe, if Jill had slept with Richard, maybe she would have made him a little more crazy than she already was, which would have added more suspense. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband discover Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, perhaps a little more history. I was a little disappointed with the film's ending. I would have liked to have seen more closure with Zack's death and perhaps closure with her husband. I must say, however, that I will never be able to look at a rocket gun and not see it standing there. It was a very fitting end for Richard. Obviously, Mitzi ROCKED! I look forward to seeing your future projects.
