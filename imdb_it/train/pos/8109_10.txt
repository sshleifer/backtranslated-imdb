History of HG Wells the shape of things to come was transformed into a film in 1935. A science fiction story very well done about a war that has lasted for decades. Casts include Raymond Massey (arsenic and old lace) Sir Cedric Hardwick (Frankenstein's ghost) Ralph Richardson (time bandits) and Margaretta Scott. A glimpse of helicopters, holograms, a spaceship and futuristic cities. This film was ahead of its time. Behind William Cameron Menzies (invaders of Mars) it is very pleasant as the first metropolis of cinema (1927) but avoids the so-called sequel, the form of things to come, which was made in 1979. this film has nothing to do with the original file.hg wells like Jules Verne had a vision for the future with his stories. A classic science fiction film.10 out of 10
