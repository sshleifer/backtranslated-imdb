Nina Foch offers a surprisingly strong performance as the protagonist in this fun little gothic fingernail. He accepts a position as the secretary of a widow of the London society (played imperiously by Dame May Witty) and his disturbing son (the annoying effect of George Macready). Before she knows it, she wakes up to find herself in a seaside manor she has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call her Marian and are trying to convince the servants and inhabitants of the neighboring city that she is Macready's crazy wife. Of course this couple can only plan cowardly actions, and even though we know that Julia must eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis creates a real suspense in answering the question about how he will manage it. <br /> <br /> "My Name Is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to distinguish from any number of films released in the same period, but I was surprised by how it was held together despite the scarce budget and the pedigree of the B-movie. There are some moments when you might find yourself on the edge of your seat, and I found myself cheering on Julia as she took the pattern under her feet and began to outsmart her captors. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have fainted, screamed and panted, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can't tell you how good it was to have the heroine in this movie that uses her brain and think about how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
