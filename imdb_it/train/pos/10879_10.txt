I wanted to see the cut from the day I heard about it, which was sometimes last year. Anyway, I got to see today, and when the film started I thought it had started quite a week, but it got better after about 10 minutes. I thought the movie was pretty good. but the thing that I didn't like was the creation of the murderer, I was thinking before renting that it probably would have sucked like Urban legends: the final cut, I'm almost dead. mostly everything in the final UL cut had to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is the murderer and the scenes of death. The killer takes MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I cut an 8 out of 10
