I claim that anyone ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this film is completely confused. NO ONE I know I wanted to see this film based on previews, and ALL those who actually saw it (I know) absolutely loved it ... The advertising campaign is dishonor / disaster / error. <br /> <br /> Open to # 4 behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I saw a fantastic film, but the third week, the average IMDb score of 8.7 (I would say deservedly). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie, which I saw, okay movie but 4th week out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower than Bourn's, but it was ours for 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> Whether it was a poor schedule or a poor advertisement, I think the powers behind this movie have gone great! Should this have been advertised as a fantastic film that seems to be a fantasy / fairy tale and not advertised as just another fairy tale ?? Too bad :( Anyway - Now that I have bothered very uselessly ... Fantastic movie, go see it!
