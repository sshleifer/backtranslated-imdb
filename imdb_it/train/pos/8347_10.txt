Maybe I'm too generous with the vote ... but I love this movie! I've seen it many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing huge or monumental happening. But I'm a great romantic and this movie * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's such a beautiful, good film - and those are so rare now! Even my 20-year-old brother likes this movie, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you are alone and need to * look * at a love story, if you yourself can't participate in a love story. It's a good one!
