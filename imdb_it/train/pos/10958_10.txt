This show is so incredibly funny that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (despite having already seen all the previous episodes). I have always considered Silverman a great talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent that can be appreciated by a wide audience. I watch this show and laugh at a large percentage of the time ... I can't say this for many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new, interesting and (most importantly) fun! This is a show that I will never miss, and one that I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to see this show ... I expect a long series for this series ... And to be clear, the people who are offended by this show just don't understand ... maybe they lack the intelligence to understand it. .. they should stop fooling themselves by attacking something they don't understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in reference to Silverman, or who claims to just "shock" ... is far from the mark ... It's just the opposite; only Google and you will quickly see that you are a great supporter of civil rights, etc. If you don't know that he is ironically embracing all these outrageous points of view, you don't understand. And if you don't understand it, do the rest of us a favor and be quiet so that we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
