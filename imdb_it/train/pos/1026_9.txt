I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two interpreters brought the show with a skilful support by the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in the 9-10 seasons was enough to take the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is simply extraordinary. You get the feeling that actors love pal around after the camera stops rotating. This report fits into the program we can see. <br /> <br /> RDA gives the character O'Neill credibility. He never knows when to give the essay to him at rest. Watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his statements. However, they know that it is the man to have around when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' below the surface. They manage to hold the lid, but often barely. The "Solitudes" episode in season one had some of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between the two made the possibility of dying bearable because he faced them together. <br /> <br /> 'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to smooth out some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. Yet O'Neill's tactical instinct always seems healthy. He understands what to do without having to think about the issue. The team was endangered several times by others who did not listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> Quality has declined noticeably in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly out of stock and the new villains never really caught my interest in bringing the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances during these two seasons. You could see her appearance changed a lot after having a baby. He was probably thinking more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> The "Stargate Atlantis" spin-off has a few moments, but it is above all a weaker effort. The main characters lack the chemistry of the original cast. The bad guys (Wraiths) are so unlikely to be ridiculous. Perhaps Amanda Tapping can breathe life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There has always been a problem for me in the special effects of the show. Having pyramid-shaped spaceships is a design monstrosity rarely matched in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for lighting these ships is just as bad. The captivating use of antique Egyptian furniture that hides ultra-modern technology is just as difficult to accept. I also wondered about part of the continuity of the show. In season 2's opening, "Daniel Jackson" is hit and his uniform has an open hole where he was injured. He slips into a sarcophagus and heals his body and restores his uniform as if he had just stepped out of the closet in the wardrobe closet. The 'Hathor' episode has a sarcophagus falling into the hands of the SGC, but it is never mentioned again. This device may have been used in several subsequent episodes on "Daniel", "O'Neill" and "Dr. Frasier '.
