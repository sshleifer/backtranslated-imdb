I was up late, flipping over cable channels one night and I came across this movie for about 10 minutes at the beginning - every time I thought about going to bed, something kept telling me to keep watching it even though it was very far from my hour to go to bed. <br /> <br /> This film may have been another simple anti-bullet film, but instead they chose to examine the side effects of the shootings. And even better, the film continues with real life - just when you think they will take the easy and obviously devised route, a turning point comes and changes the whole perspective of the film. This film not only does not follow the formula, but shows how other events often lead and / or influence what happens next. <br /> <br /> I just wish the filmmakers had explored the problems related to antidepressant drugs more - the guys at Columnbine who did the shooting were on them for years and it was terrifying to watch as Deanna made them burst whenever the nightmares started. Until recently, they distributed things like candy and only now are they beginning to understand what drugs have long-term effects. It was very pleasant to see that the aspect of mental illness in history has been given a good deal of film, having a relative who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the film had gone mad in every aspect of mental illness. Good for the director and writer who obviously did his homework on these issues. And for those who think that certain things can't happen in a hospital (I don't want to tell anyone), you died badly too - I was there. The script was so real that it was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Go BUY this movie and show it to your teen before it's too late. One day they will thank you for it.
