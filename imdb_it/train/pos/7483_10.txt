Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egoist who takes the emotions of others for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies him at David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed partner. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist who interviews David. All their interactions and their consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most exciting and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain the plot any more, because it's much more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all the people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
