This has a lot to do - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of slag - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little buzz - Kelly. It was the first real Sinatra film in which the producer spent a penny and could be seen on the screen (he had previously appeared in two low-budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively) but if they were based only on Sinatra tubes and the six deep seeds of Grayson and Iturbi advancing with the ego would have left us a much narrower film and a better showcase for Sinatra. How is he got a very high score in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We hate to leave, I begged - to his suns, What makes the sunset, the charm of you and I love in love too easily. Despite this, Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the 1940s out of a tenth of the budget.
