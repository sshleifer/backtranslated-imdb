Poor Edera: Although born born, she had the misfortune to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). While the film is set in the 1920s or 1930s, when the rigid Victorian class ideas began to fray on the edge, this state of uncertainty unduly torments it. The Gretorex (for which they were called) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but there are yachting parties and balloons in an elegant style in abundance to tempt you. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gentleman (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), he sets up one of his extra advantages for him. Fortunately, one of the beaux with which it still intertwines (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose consultation rooms provide a reserve of poison, with which he offered farewell to her husband. The fact that it involves Knowles does not diminish it a bit, even if the hours pass slowly until it should be hanged by the neck until death. The turn of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the fearsome Lucile Watson); and the faithful governess of Knowles (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this melodrama well above the average; Fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest.
