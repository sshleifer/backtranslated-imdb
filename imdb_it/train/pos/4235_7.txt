.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! Whatever happened to old Burton who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as a quest for his preparation to direct Batman in 1988-89? Burton didn't study the book or the film because he did it all wrong! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and does not deal with the same subject as the original. If you want a good monkey movie, look at the original. <br /> <br /> ** of the stars ****
