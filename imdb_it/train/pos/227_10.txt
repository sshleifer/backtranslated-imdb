Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this movie, you may think that Duvall's appearance is reincarnation at its best. One of my favorite films I wish the composer Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or a soundtrack was available. Wonderful landscapes and music and "all too real," especially for those of us who live or have moved to the south. This is a "real moment in time". Life progresses slowly, but "strangers do not stay".
