OK, first a correction to the tag posted on the main page of this film. Abe Lincoln did not accompany his sister in the film, nor did he stop at his sister's grave. The individual in question is Ann Rutledge, who was a close friend of Lincoln in his New Salem days. Some say that Ann was, in effect, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support him. <br /> <br /> Now, there are fabrications and fictions in this film. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the case of the court that is in the film is based on a real event: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is largely fictionalized in this film with a lot of name changes, he will still have the spectators riveted to the screen. This is the golden age of Hollywood, with a drama at its best, and Henry Fonda offers perhaps the best Lincoln played by anyone.
