Overall this film has been excellent for its time and will be interesting for many other generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate for the book, most are correct. The film jumps a lot forward and loses some important parts. I found the book ready and immediately wanted them to make a movie (because I hadn't discovered the film yet), but later found the film in a business basket at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I expected. Overall, I gave this film 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and a general sense) and for its bad parts (large jumps and small but significant inaccuracies).
