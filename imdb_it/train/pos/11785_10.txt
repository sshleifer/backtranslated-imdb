I don't know how to explain "Darkend Room", because summarizing it would not do justice. It is a short film par excellence Lynchian with two beautiful girls in a strange and mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more in the "Mulholland Drive" part of the Lynchian spectrum, as opposed to "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It's hidden on Lynch's website and it's worth the search.
