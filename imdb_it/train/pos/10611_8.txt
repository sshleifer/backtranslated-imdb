What another reviewer called lack of character development, I call understatement. The film did not hit one over the head with over-explosiveness or unnecessary background. Yes, there have been many untold stories that we've only had a taste of, but this was mainly a one-day snapshot of an event that catalyzed change in all the lives of the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was a truly enchanting study of the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental
