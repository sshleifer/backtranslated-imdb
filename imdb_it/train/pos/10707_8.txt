For a film that had little publicity, and few people have heard of it, this was pretty good. It is another of these modern British crime films that are bizarre ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not as wild as "Snatch" but it's interesting and has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has an insignificant and somewhat predictable ending but at the beginning of the show - not late - it has some twists to make it very interesting for the first time viewer Basically, it is a male British low-key who sends away for a Russian "mail-order bride" who stops, with the help of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Co-protagonist of Chapin and Nicole Kidman, and are very good as Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different type of film and well acted. Kidman proves once again to be more than just a pretty face.
