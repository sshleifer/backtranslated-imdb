I've seen a lot of PPVs in the past, but this is the most fun and intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. Extra DVDs are worth it because they give a different view of how wrestlers act after the show (like the chris benoit / edge interview interview), some glimpses of the Monday Night Wars era, the first game of the winning title tag of Hogan gold and some promotional speeches. Also there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Match Tag Team Table: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley against Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 This was a pretty good and intense game to start the show. Not too many grips and only pure raw physics. Spike can stand comparison in table games and Guerro and Benoit have given good wrestling skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble with Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd never worried about either of the two wrestlers and didn't care until Kidman made a print of a shooting star. Usually people expect a lot of high flights in a cruise weight championship, but this has had very little. In fact it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, nobody cared or knew (you can tell from the lack of camera flash). The finish was quick though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I've never really liked the role of wrestler, it lacks intensity and style. Hardy was awesome, but he didn't have the chance to show off his high flying act, though he still performed some good counters and added that he needs a fast pace for the game. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's fun to look back at Cena's first PPV, how he acted, how he dressed and how he looked (watch his interview, it's pretty funny). This was a good intense match with Cena showing a good variety of jacks, suplexes, counters and some planes. Jericho was a sub-par but surely helped Cena launch his career. Dinner Wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good game. Both styles of wrestlers match the screen perfectly, with Brocks pure power and raw energy compared to RVD, skill and speed. RVD looked great in this game (better than his last board and dinner matches) and the whole game was fast. The ending worked perfectly because he still kept Brock's undefeated streak while giving RVD his right desserts in his home state. <br /> <br /> 6. No disqualification matches: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked a certain intensity like the RVD match but still a good following. Although it started slowly (which always happens with the big show) Booker T was awesome and made a sick move on the announcers table. The finalizer was fantastic, the finale was a great success and a great step forward for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge against Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This it was a mediocre match. Hogan comes out as usual from a huge pop, but his variety of moves lacks intensity and energy. Then again Christian doesn't have exactly the greatest athletic ability. This ended up being a mediocre meeting, but it was still OK for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple game threatens the undisputed championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily the match of the year. This is by far the best triple threat game I've ever seen. He had close falls, many finisher, stolen finisher, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could have predicted who would get out of this. If you are going to buy this DVD I would buy it strictly for this game. (ending up paying attention to you!) <br /> <br /> Overall this was a solid PPV with a lot of extra extras to keep watching again and again. Although this is hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD) it is definitely worth it.
