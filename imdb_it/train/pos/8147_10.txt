The fear of a black hat is a hilarious parody of the Hip-Hop culture. It's fun like This Is Spinal Tap, if not more fun. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is an extraordinary talent who should be the protagonist of many other films. This film is a true cult cult!
