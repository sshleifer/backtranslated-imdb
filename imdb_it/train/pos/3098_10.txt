I loved this show so much and I'm so incredibly sad that it was canceled and I thought it was back, but just two stupid weeks. It's terrible. I hate how we will never find out how they all end. sucks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and so on, but it doesn't give time to good ones like Six Degrees. If they complain about the ratings, it's probably because they had a wrong space because this was really a good show, something I could relate to and predict. JJ Abrams has delivered, it's fantastic, I wish the ABC could trust him enough to complete the story. I also loved the whole cast. I couldn't wait to see how they all met at once. Everyone's story is now incomplete, now I'll never know if Steven and Whitney would be together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is really so downer.
