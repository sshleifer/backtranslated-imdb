Director Douglas Sirk still marks with this, the grandfather of all dysfunctional family films. This lush and trashy saga is a masterpiece, which beautifully combines all the elements of Sirk's sdogan and strategically places them in a single film. "Written on the Wind" has very clearly influenced the TV series of the 80s "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is basically an integral version of those later nighttime soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, beautifully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries the oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to either, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the silent but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's Texas family mansion, where we meet her white bitch, a half-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar shift). Yipee! Sparks start flying - from novels to battles, this is a camping trip. Not only must Mitch fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone since she can't have her one true love which is Mitch. Completing it all, Kyle finds out he's powerless, but somehow Lucy gets pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love him? This film marks one of Universal's most popular films and one of the best works by director Sirk. Some of the dialogues are absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in anyway - the theme of wind in general is big. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underutilized despite receiving the best billing behind Hudson. The loss of Oscar from the Stack reportedly devastated him. He considered this his best performance and apparently was not at all happy to lose it. And he made a fabulous performance like the whiny alcoholic. What a sensational movie! This film demonstrates what I thought for years - Sirk is the master of classical melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
