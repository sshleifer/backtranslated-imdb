A class offering from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ("The Far Pavillions" etc.) turn into a classy and elegant four-hander with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) all giving elegant performances, despite a low budget that translates into some "non-special effects". The most important contribution, however, is that of Chloe Franks, 7 years old, who realizes in a chilling way her part that makes the blood cool. Only spoiled by the filthy title wanted by the film by its distributors, this underrated version, a cut above the shocking film 'blood' n 'guts', is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.
