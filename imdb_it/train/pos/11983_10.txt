This show has a fantastic plot! It is very credible! A man's wife dies and he can't take care of his children alone, so he calls his brother-in-law his best friend and many others come later in the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, the kind and strong dog Cometa, Nikki and Alex that you can discover for yourself (I don't want to ruin it for you) and to force Kimmy Gibler! (The DJ sidekick) but the kids are wonderful too. This is Mary Kate and Ashley left for the first time! And you can also meet Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and this is so crow! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, the weak middle child who feels excluded. Really this is a very good show!
