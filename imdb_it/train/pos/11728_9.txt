There are two things I like about Elvira, and they're both bigger than her and she keeps them hidden: her intelligence and her talent. A film is the best thing to show how fun it can be or how to draw attention. Seeming a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits the property of a distant relative only to discover that she is indeed the heir to the occult. The comedy in this film is the best thing, but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling. It's mostly a campy race with lots of bad horror movie references like the rioting crowd or the escaping heroine who stumbles and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when he uses his wonderful skills to break the chains and keep it locked in the cemetery. The ending is incredibly sweet as if it were written by Brady, but the Las Vegas act in the end seems too great for this kind of film.
