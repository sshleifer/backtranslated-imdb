Henry Fool surprised me. I didn't expect him to entertain and entertain the same way, or so strongly, as he did. Fay Grim continues to surprise because it provides a solid continuation to a story that doesn't seem to need it. Once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, however, it becomes blinding to know that this is one of the BEST sequels of the brilliant indie film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I'm glad it's part of this short period. It is as convincing and delicious as the Fulbright agent. A delight is also Liam Aiken, who appropriately portrays Fay and Henry's son Ned Grim. <br /> <br /> This film is a pleasure for many reasons. I am pleased, for example, to discover that Henry is not really the loser that seems (at the end of the Fool), and to discover further that he is, in fact, a genius ... well, that is really a stroke of pen's love. <br /> <br /> I hope they make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. They should authorize him Ned Fool Grim and he should be Liam looking for his father, to validate the fantastic change in his mother and the sense of almost genius that he himself feels inside him. Assuming, of course, that Fay continues to deny many of his son's most important facts about his father. Looks like it needs to be done. I'd buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more actions, this is not yet an action movie. It's more dramatic and intriguing ... a mystery of sorts. I will watch it often. <br /> <br /> Evaluate an 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
