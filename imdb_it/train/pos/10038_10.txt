Titanic must be one of my favorite movies of all time. He has his problems (what movies don't do) but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> When I stumble into someone asking me why I like the Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, don't you?" I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. "The love story is too trivial" well, yes, but isn't it fun and moving? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that a love like this doesn't really exist. But this is a film, don't we all like to look at a beautiful story that lets us slip into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this film, I agree that they don't perform to their full potential. However, I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a film in which they are not extraordinary. But the roles that are assigned are simple, and the characters seem real enough to worry them a bit, but I agree with many people that they didn't do as well as might be expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if one complains that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate the story, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why have they ever gone to see a film that is so clearly all these things. It's like the people complaining about The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply to be a movie, not because you don't like the genre, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Worthy of his Oscars, in particular, Best Photography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie except perhaps the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that some of the scripts fail, like the constant shouting of each other's names during the film. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an incredible accomplishment in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking is so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like this film, but for the most part it comes down to those who do not like the fundamental idea, such as a love story, rather than thinking that the film is badly built in itself. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five Titanic books, including memories of the day it happened, and this film is extremely historically accurate, except for a few errors. The only main ones I can find is that the pipes must be threaded in copper, not steel, and the iceberg seems quite unrealistic as is the scene in which they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this film a 10/10, not because I like love films, but simply because it's an exceptional cinematic result, which leaves a sensation horrified by the realistic adaptation of the events.
