I really enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire gives a terrific performance like Jake. Must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous jokes in the whole movie. He was extremely good in this case too, even though I never saw him utter a comic line first. The film involves you with the characters and really makes you wonder what will become of them all. I didn't know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think it did quite well. Lots of exciting scenes. A really good ride. I am absolutely a Maguire fan. Check the cider house rules. One of the best ever.
