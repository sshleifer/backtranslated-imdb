Who votes in these assessments? "Jacknife" is a beautifully acted, brilliantly viewed, work of art with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the unparalleled Robert DeNiro (please don't mention Marlon Brando in the same breath as this man - see "Taxi Driver "" to confirm this point. It is a "trivial" film because it has no meaningless sex / action / nudity in it. This film is about the complexity of the characters involved. And Harris makes you feel every moment with him and the his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking The part he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a marvelous observation of how fashion and cinema take advantage of tragic situations and how frustrated real men are should feel they see an arrogant young sportsman. While we are on this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, by one of the greatest directors, played by THE greatest cinematic actor all-time graphic designer, with the scariest psychotic gangster film of all time, deserves only above average? COME ON!!!!!
