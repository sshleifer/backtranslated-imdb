A meteor crashes on Crater Lake, the heat of the impact that causes the hatching of a prehistoric egg. Okay, so the plot is just garbage. But despite its obvious low budget, this presents itself as one of the most compelling and entertaining monster-on-the-loose films out there. There are also some good moments of humor. In an age full of so-called "monsters" that are nothing but laughable creations of a man in rubber or lizards dressed in frills and forced to divide each other (low-cost style of exploitation), it is refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur gemma is an excellent Harryhausen-style stop-motion creature. <br /> <br /> A film that is hard to find, but worth finding.
