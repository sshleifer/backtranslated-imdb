I thought the whole movie was well played with fresh images and interesting cinematography all the time. The actors were at the top of their character's back in almost perfect timing and looked fantastic. The music was lush and well thought out. He also had a decent turn of a final. So what's everyone voted for? The story was not entirely fresh (it seemed a remnant of "Running Man" with the idea of ​​the entire television series), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public chooses their Messiah certainly seemed true enough. It makes sense to follow this man who was introduced to a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious take it because the film has the word "God" in it, but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is teach a chance to people who may not they have never seen the world like this, especially in the modern world where Christianity has been increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave a 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought that every ounce of the film was fun and original, for the most part. Check it out if you're not too offended to see a funny movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the modern Messiah coming to a TV near you.
