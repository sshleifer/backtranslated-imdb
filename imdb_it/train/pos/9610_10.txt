I cried hard, watching this movie. I have never suffered from eating disorders, but I think this must be a very true image. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is excellent! She expresses these feelings incredibly well. My adolescence came back to me so vividly. Anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or as a teenager will be able to relate to this film. I advise you all to see it! <br /> <br /> Even the music is fantastic - I discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see Alison Lohman in White Ol√©ander, because I'm positive, she fits the role of Agnes perfectly.
