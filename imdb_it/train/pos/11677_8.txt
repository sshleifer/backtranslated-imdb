I loved Long Way Round and I didn't even know about Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a while "this will be the first episode" I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was exceptional as were the other crew members. It's good to see him again with Ewan. There was a good deal of oath, but that didn't bother me. As for their being mention on the package. This is much more to do with the stupid Classification Certificate that the BBFC has. They should have given him a 15 for the tongue alone. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more !!
