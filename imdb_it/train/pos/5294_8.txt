"Pecker" shows that Waters has no intention of changing his bad taste in his old age. Many things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants. Over the years, the budget of Waters films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that "trailer park" twist. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child obsessed with photography. He lives a quiet life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the ever-looking Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worse. Once again, Waters mocks art, fame and heterosexuality. It's not among his best films, but here are some great laughs ("Memama" has the best lines in the film!). He's always smart and funny, and he has the same "queer" sensibility that I learned to love in Warters movies.
