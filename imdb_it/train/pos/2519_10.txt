This film is really special. It is a very beautiful film. Starting with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, they are poor children, living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, and then they managed to live, to buy a house, and their life seems to be improving a lot. They are becoming new friends, friends of life. But something has gone wrong and they are becoming enemies and everything ends up killing each other. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I was a negative film, because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, ex-singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - singer from Taiwan) trying to become actors, but this is not like the other singer-actors-films. They are doing a great job and without previous experience in movies (except Lee-Hom, who had already been in two films before). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but - it was this film that made me discover him. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - the orphan Sho) was a part of the group that wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play the friend of Sho, the vampire Kei. At that time they didn't know each other, at least not as friends. But after the film they became really good friends, and this also shows us that they really worked hard at this film and that they had a good collaboration. <br /> <br /> The film has many different feelings going through history, Love, Hate, Sadness, Pain, Loneliness, Happiness and so on. I think the first one is the best, it's so beautiful. After people are dying, Kei leaves and everything changes so much. But it's still a great film, it's the only film that has ever made me cry, it ends so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen this movie, you really should. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret. ^^
