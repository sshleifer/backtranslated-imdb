In Mexico this film was only broadcast on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a true example of a good German and especially of a good man. The conversations between the character of Tukur and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. A real war of ideas: two different Germans, both with faith in there believe. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, fianc√©, ecclesiastic and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is as exceptional as Bonhoeffer. I have recommended this film a lot, especially at this difficult time for the planet. In Mexico we don't know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and heritage, this is a great work to save a forgotten hero.
