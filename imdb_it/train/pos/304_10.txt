I looked at it a few years ago. I remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholy things, like the fate of Dorothy and the personal future of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> I turn around to look at my VHS copy and then I was reviewing it and more. Today I'm waiting for the DVD version, at any price, please! <br /> <br /> The country and easy listening music are very well chosen from the first second, a little bluish, but also happy. <Br /> <br /> All the characters are fantastic to me, with fun situations, great acting and many dialogues that have turned me into a cult movie for me and many people I've met on the Internet or in movie clubs . This may not be random. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope for life! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know this could be a particular comment for the film, but the fact is that I like it a lot, I think that film has marked me and I'll never forget it.
