I think it took a lot of courage for her to come forward like this. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers this is what helps people the most. But, in his case, what he did was remarkable. I've been in the field of mental health for five years and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I think it helped. I always thought it was big and it always will be. I'm glad that he wrote this book and that the film was made. She is an extraordinary woman and I hope you continue acting. He spent a lot of time and faced it. I would love to see you work more with children, especially with child actors. His ordeal should not have happened and I think it would be wonderful as a mentor for young people. The film was so touching for me that I was very touched. Suffering from a head injury that caused the onset of my disorder and having PTSD, it's nice to know that someone has the courage to show his life like she did. I believe he helped this nation and people in general understand that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you, Mrs Duke, or Anna, which you never prefer.
