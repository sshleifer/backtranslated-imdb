This is one of the few films published on a type of "what if" situation that made me think. It was amazing to hear them talking to each other, and remembering all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them.

Thinking that they were together to fix things between them in this way is a comforting thought for people who wish to have the chance to free up air with someone they failed to reach. Seeing John as such a caring and relaxed character was refreshing to hear all the trash we were talking about ...
