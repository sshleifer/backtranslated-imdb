Whoopi was the only reason I saw the Oscars that year. She is hilarious. Obviously there was a serious side to the show. It was great not just because it's fun, but because it said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. Whites should be reminded that ceremonies, employment and representation of Hollywood Awards are absolutely wrong. There should be no need for "black" prizes. The white bread nominators and judges, billionaires, must bring their heads to the sun and see that the great material is not limited to directors, producers, actors, etc. Whites. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was the depth of bad taste. He had no business being there. The point is that this is the first Oscar presentation I've seen since "The Color Purple" was in the running for the awards. That miscarriage of vote irritated me from watching the shows until 2002. Which is not to denigrate the other presenters. Billy Crystal is a revolt.
