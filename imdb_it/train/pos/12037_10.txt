The Woman In Black was a British film produced for TV, first broadcast on the BBC by Christmave Eve in 1989 and again in '92. I think he toured American TV on A & E. He was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90s, but he went out of print. A US company later published it on DVD, but that version was also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights of the film are now owned by someone else and will not be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I have heard about this movie only recently on a bulletin board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about $ 28. He is sure that it is counterfeited by a seller in the far east, even if the DVD says "made in Canada", ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can't really criticize bootleg labels for releasing rare, spent and lost things in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a period piece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and picturesque British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very suggestive and dark. For the most part, the film is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self-indulgence, violence or much else in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It's a classic and chilling ghost film. The film itself seems to have been made in the 1930s, except for the color. Without all the flash of all modern horror films, I fear that this film is always a lost jewel. For me, it stands as one of my all-time favorites.
