I went to see this movie twice, a friend of mine went to see him at the release party, and he was telling me that it was so beautiful, that I expected a lot for the film, to mutilate, I couldn't enjoy it because I wasn't watching neutral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I liked it a lot more than the first time. After the second time I felt so in the mood for partying. I LOVED the music is just fantastic. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his talent in directing, he will be a director that everyone will talk about. If you can disappoint this movie as your first you have to have talent. <br /> <br /> The acting is the work of some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a group of emerging talents like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
