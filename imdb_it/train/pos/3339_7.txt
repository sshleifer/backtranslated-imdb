The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter are still there. With "Fever Pitch" the creators of other films that have tackled many crude themes, abandon that tactic when they decide to bring the Nick Hornby film to screen, something that would have been difficult to do. The novel, of the same title, dealt with a man's obsession with football, since it is set in England, where this sport consumes most British sports fans. It is thanks to the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, to turn the book into a language that most Americans liked when they are their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a film featuring an obsessive fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life revolves around the Red Sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher with mysterious ways of engaging his students in the topic that tries to teach them. When Ben takes four of his best students for a tour of a local company, he meets, and falls madly in love with the valiant Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who is going to places, but at thirty, has no life of its own. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the Red Sox, at home games, at Fenway Park. Fans of this team are probably the most loyal people in the world, having formed a team that does wonderful things but, until 2004, has never won a World Series. In fact, the ending, from what we heard, had to be changed because that was the year they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the middle of the film. Mrs. Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a famous television comedian, who became a film actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in "Taxi", in our humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The Brothers Farrelly movie will also satisfy their fans as a baseball fan with this baseball story.
