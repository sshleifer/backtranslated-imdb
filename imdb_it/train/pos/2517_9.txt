I received this movie from Netflix after a long waiting period, so I anticipated it a lot when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would be difficult, as well as ... well, do you know what all the screaming fan girls were talking about? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? This kind of thing? Fearing. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly watchable, even though the filming and music made it seem like someone was going to break out a couple of chun-chucks every two scenes, and Gackt's acting was pretty good. Hyde, being, um, Hyde, acted like an almost romantic character / gang member that anyone who saw him on stage would not be surprised at all. It is one of my two main beef with the film itself. But the rest of the cast (including the child actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did - which was, mostly, shot and screamed. But my second problem was very minor, having to do with goriness. It seemed too much suspense - horror to me - like every scene someone shot, or they collapsed, really sincerely dead, or stayed there long enough. But Sho ... just ... takes the shots, several times, topples over, makes a BARREL while he talks and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're a fan of all the actors or just a fan of j-movies, it's definitely worth watching.
