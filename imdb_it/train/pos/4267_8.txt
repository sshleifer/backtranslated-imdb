During a party by Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, WHERE DO WE GO HERE? was finally unearthed for a screening. It is surprising that a film of any age that has collaborations with Weill-Gershwin may be missing from the screens. The score is high, and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only highlights its merits, which are considerable. Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of those. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray fails to understand the material well. Furthermore, the "modern" segment is written weakly. BUT the fantasy elements bring the film to a high score, as does the work of the two top women - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the fascination that this type of work desperately needs to work. Like a second world war salutes the history of our country - even if in a "never been" picture, the film has its place in the musical history of Hollywood and should be available to everyone to see and find its remarkable merits.
