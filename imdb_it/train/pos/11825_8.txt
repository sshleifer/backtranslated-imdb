Don't look for an overdeveloped plot here ... just sit down with some popcorn and enjoy this. A gallery of stars appear as the villains of the classic cartoon character in this live comedy, which features incredible tricks and sets, not to mention the knockout performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for children and adults. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
