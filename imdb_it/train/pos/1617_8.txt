'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is no love story, there are at least three, but all have to do with the same family. Loretta Loretta's family (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him, but he's a sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny don't talk in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Naturally they fall to one for the other. <br /> <br /> As this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop, it is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every visa is a pleasure to look at, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. He won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good and stupid, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are fantastic. This film is fun, fascinating and therefore very funny.
