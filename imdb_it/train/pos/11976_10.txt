This show is about three girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a drunk driver, so their father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about living life. Girls face life's problems and hold life lessons. They develop dunks, boyfriends and many others. The whole show is about to go with the flow. You don't have to hold a grudge, you just have to let it go. I think this show is really nice and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and I still watch it today. I'm glad they broadcast this show on television. I watch it almost every day. I consider it 10/10.
