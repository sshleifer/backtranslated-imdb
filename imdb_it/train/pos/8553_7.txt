I just saw the film I was afraid it would disappoint me. I was rather surprised at the end though. The American cake franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. yes, it won't be true if I tell you that I liked it as much as I liked the originals. the beta house together with the previous two cakes has definitely lost something that the first two cakes had.it will not become a classic as the first two have already done. but what the hell-it's still fun with many good moments and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta house deserves 6/10 but I gave it 7/10 just to be another slice of cake.
