I was not aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew that I was extremely scared of going to see this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but I was ten years old now). The first scene in which the Blob crawls on the farmer's search stick and overwhelms his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered for every attack of our monster. I felt such horror when Steve and his girlfriend could barely get out of the doctor's office (poor doctor), and even more so when The Blob entered a cinema and devoured a large part of the audience. . . so many in fact that Oooooo exploded outside the front doors, too big now to fit one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when he trapped poor Steve in a sieve-like restaurant, it seemed like a safe dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that the Blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end, it would be better to freeze small children who frighten and break mentally. <br /> <br /> I remember walking home with my uncle Nick in the evening, trying to act brave. He knew I was in trouble, and when I went to bed that night I could not only hear the Blob in the room, but when I summoned the courage to look down at the floor, here is the hungry and beating guy with a red heart Sat, waiting for I tried to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old now. . . I've done it. <br /> <br /> Obviously The Blob was not destroyed.
