I've known Bettie Page for many years now. Her soft-core porn images from the 1950s have become iconographic and still have a strong appeal today. Even the "Bettie Page" aspect is still very popular in the hetero-fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it was then. So I watched this movie with a little familiarity to begin with. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was extremely fun to see the re-creation of the film by real figures like Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager ?? all consider the pioneers today. Mary Harron did a great job creating the desired atmosphere of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950s America along with a sexuality that, according to today's standards, was innocent in the extreme. I particularly liked the use of monochromatic versus color as a visual shortcut to the emotional and spiritual climate in which Bettie found herself. I think Gretchen Mol did an excellent job in presenting Bettie's character in all her innocent sexuality and all her total naivety. Bettie loved to look pretty, she loved attention, she didn't see anything wrong with nudity and she enjoyed dressing up in "stupid clothes" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and profoundly fetishistic desires that all this evoked were completely lost on her. Until today he still does not understand "what it was about" when it comes to his photos or their content S & M. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is not educated or too simple to understand only that she he simply does not "understand" fetishism and never will. No damage there. Bettie Page is simply becoming who she is. The film captured it very well. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 50s painted by Mrs Harron and written by her together with Guinevere Turner makes me really happy to live in the day and age I do. Hypocrisy and repression, combined with massive ignorance about our sexuality, joined a frighteningly stifling world. The film captures this well and cheers as Bettie endures everything with her unwavering faith and her unchanging naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit slow at times but it hit all the points that Mrs. Harron tried to hit them well I would recommend this movie even for those people with little or no knowledge of who Bettie was Page and what effect it had on American culture. For those with such interests, then this film is a must see.
