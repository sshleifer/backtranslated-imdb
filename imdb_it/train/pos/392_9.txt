The Legend of Zu, as I've seen, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who didn't like it didn't see the mythology underlying the film. They were expecting something like Star Wars, and that wasn't it. Joseph Campbell, I believe, wanted this film. There were a number of hidden metaphors and meanings that an average observer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords within us. We all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. Of course, some of the narratives were a bit confusing, and some of the actions took a little bit of fear at times, but I think other points in the film have easily compensated. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> I don't know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (the doubled US version). He may have been amazed at the public Americans, who would have really penalized this film.
