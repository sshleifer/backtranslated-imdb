Somehow I lost this movie when it came out and I discovered it until last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can't remember another intimate dramatic film, which does so many things so well. The writing is sharp, realistic, nuanced and even contained. Cinematography and editing are understated but inspired, allowing visual narration to dominate through wonderful close-ups and shots of images, capturing solitude and alienation in the most memorable ways. Acting is also wonderful, with all the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most convincing ways a film can offer. They reveal their deepest weaknesses with unprotected and unprocessed vulnerabilities. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi and the rest of the team. A must see for cinema fans.
