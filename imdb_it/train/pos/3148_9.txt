I love this show. Period. I haven't looked very long, probably just about six months or so, actually, but now it's my favorite show and probably will be for a while. I love all the characters, except I don't really care about Donna. I'm not entirely sure why. Only. I don't find it funny, and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Besides her, I find the rest of the cast pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played the parents of Erics, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I didn't completely hate the eighth season. I look at him again and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it to previous shows, its ... not good. Randy is horrible. The finish was decent, nothing extraordinary, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but oh well. I have the fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of his funniest episodes, in my opinion, were "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking", but I love every episode I've seen so far, which is most of them, I think . =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
