It was only to my second vision, years later, that I realized two things about this film: 1) I liked it immensely, and 2) that because its execution is definitely more acute than the premise itself deserves. I had laughed my way through the film before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests - valleys, gags and carefree (even * good * - unperturbed empty head) are not intrinsically funny, especially when they are designed for feature films. But even if the momentum of the film begins to spit towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comic time all over the world that even the most clumsy jokes (eg . Ted unable to recognize a certain inhabitant of Hell) works as effortlessly as the wetter ones (for example the challenge). And the team of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the team of Bill and Ted (who pass only a separate scene in the whole film, the disaster if they are not well matched) appears completely without limits. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found the first film only sporadically funny - visually different comic sensibilities there, apparently.) <br /> <br /> I give him a 7.75. Surprisingly funny.
