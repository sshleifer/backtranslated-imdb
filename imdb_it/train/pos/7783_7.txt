A young girl who survived as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> An economic hustler who wants to get the highest score. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand. You could think of the opening titles which will be a violent film but it is also a love story with two people in their own struggle to get money for a better way to live. This film sometimes seems wise due to its image changes, but still refreshing. This story also speaks of Eros and Thanatos. "It is not an original joke, but it is well told" says a character and this is also true for this: we saw the story but in this way we see it. Thailand appears in warm tones, the photograph moves from a colorful place to a multicolored place. And it captures the city like the cage of these imperfect people. There is also a good use of music to equip actions.
