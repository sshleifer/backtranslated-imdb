A scientific team of the Pentagon seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility but when the boffin leader looks for it on himself he cannot reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with power, he becomes psychotic in the classic tradition of HG Wells. <br /> <br /> This is a cheerfully horrible Invisible Man story, tastefully delivered by the ever-refined Verhoeven and Bacon as the genius turned loonytoon-maniac. As much of Verhoeven's work has a terrifying and unbridled sense of the adventure of the Boy's-Own comic (the secret underground laboratory where scientists work is simply wonderful) combined with the most horrible and depraved images (women in underwear are tempted and attacked by an invisible demon, animals killed to death, literally liters of blood and wholesale massacres in the last two rolls). While the story does not resonate in any new idea of ​​an old idea, the special effects of Scott E. Anderson's CG are astonishing when we see that veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh literally appear out of nowhere In particular , a sequence in which the team brings back a gorilla from the invisible state and the scene in which Bacon drowns Devane in a pool, are absolutely breathtaking in details and in the artistic invention of the effects. The film also has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror film photography by Jost Vacano. The young cast is virtually obscured by the technical pedigree of the film, but both Shue and Dickens are extraordinarily out of their depth. This is a fun and entertaining movie.
