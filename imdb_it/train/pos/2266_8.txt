It takes a while to get used to Nick Nolte's Nebraskan locutions, before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. Once past the bar, it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success from every point of view until the war is about to break out. He is visited by a jovial American, John Goodman, who persuades him to accept a post as an anti-Semitic radio station for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics, but he thinks it is a challenge to write a role that is almost impossible and then play alone. Another American secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts - here inserting a cough, a sneeze - that will serve as a code for transmitting intelligence to the Allies. There is a catch, though. No one will know of Nolte's true role as an American agent except Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt himself. If it was ever discovered, the Americans will deny it recognition. <br /> <br /> Nolte sinks forward and its violent broadcasts are very popular in Germany. His beloved wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing of what is happening, nor does she care. Nolte and Lee live in what he calls "a nation of two" on several occasions. The war ends and the trouble begins. He is captured by Americans who are bitter about his betrayal. They beat him and left him in the mud. He is saved by Goodman, his "fairy godmother", who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him some money from time to time. <br /> <br /> In 1960, he succeeded in cultivating a friendship with his neighbors, the painter Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and claims that the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. But his position and his identity somehow extend and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient Arian racists - led by a dentist and a priest. His house front and his mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He is beaten senseless by an ex-GI. But - miraculously - his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another surprise: later it turns out that he is not his wife, but rather his younger sister who has loved him since adolescence. <br /> <br /> The finale leads him to write his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967 before the trial for crimes against humanity. It is not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can speak, but not see, the occupant of the cell above his in prison. It is Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems nice enough. He advises Nolte that it is a bad habit to type for fifteen consecutive hours. "It's important to relax. You have to learn to relax." Nolte laughs aloud and shouts, "That's how I got here." The film is full of ironies. At some point in their relaxed conversations, Arkin tells him that "despite everything I still think people have a good heart." I don't know if the film was a commercial success, but if it wasn't, it is the kind of thing that could have torpedoed it for a younger audience of viewers who may never have heard of Anne Frank, let alone that alleged final statement in his diary. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is a film for adults and adult patients. History moves slowly, there is very little violence, no car chases, shootings and people do not seem subjected to manic pressure. Most likely it will slip past the spectators who do not open up to its deliberate approach. Nolte refers to the relationship between time and war between him and his wife as "a nation of two". This is a rather compact sentence. There is no doubt that someone could come up with a definition of lob but it takes some concentration to grasp its emotional importance. <br /> <br /> It is a story of a man who loses everything - his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-respect . At one point he stops walking along a busy New York street and simply stays there until after sunset, when he is moved by a curious policeman. The reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go. What Vonnegut is describing is much more than depression. I do not mean to appear condescending, but it is the kind of feeling difficult to understand in your youth. Adolescents would like to THINK that they know what holds Nolte in that one point, but it really requires maturity and the accelerated sense of finitude that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Remember Robert Frost's phrase about the house as a place where when you go they have to take you inside? Well, no place will take Nolte in
