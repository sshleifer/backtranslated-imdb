I've seen this movie three times. Last time, I kept skipping the confusing scenes to find the solution to the plot. Perhaps the plot is not meant to hang together logically. Or maybe these critical points are in the plot because Ann's memory of distant events is rather flawed. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who attended an unnamed college with the offspring of a rich family. He must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but he never seems to have family ties. He never seems to have relatives to turn to when the consequences of one of his disastrous decisions come into effect. <br /> <br /> Ann shares an evening of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of his brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted by his own behavior. I must have missed something significant here. Ann's behavior seems completely inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groom's witnesses at Lila's wedding. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, he continues to feel deep feelings for him on his deathbed. It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply in love with Ann and that he would have gladly married her. A scene showing their chance meeting years after Lila's marriage showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed a pattern for Ann's romantic relationships. He always had a fight with his men and rejected them. This pattern had with Harris and two husbands. Instead, Lila married a man who did not love and remained with her husband until her death. Maybe Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage go bankrupt. And then came Lila Ross's too comfortable reappearance at Ann's bedside. Apparently Ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann's last lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of these communications appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> I kept wondering about the house where Ann lived during her last days. How could he afford to buy such a house with the meager gains of his singing career? Ann always seemed a step ahead of the financial disaster as she raised her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoyed immensely in the setting and the music of the film. The seaside villa was so incredibly beautiful. Claire Danes was as bright as the young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I much prefer his natural brunette to the blond-looking bottle he had in movies. If only the annoying CGI fireflies went away, I could raise the film a point in my vote!
