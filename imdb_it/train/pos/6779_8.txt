George Cukor directs a dark and cynical classic. The distinctive Ronald Coleman is at his best in this piece of Noir on an actor who gets lost in his roles. The acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) chased his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) with his temperament and irregular behavior. But the two manage to keep working together to please their audience. Things start to change as John gets bored with his career; reluctantly agrees to play Othello. Become deep in the character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins to walk a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his lover (Shelley Winters), but has no memory of the vile action. <br /> <br /> Colman looks impeccable in this role. Winters is very impressive as the young woman has decided to move away from her squalid life. Still in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
