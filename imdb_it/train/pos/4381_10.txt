This radical drama has it all: first-rate acting, incredible photography, beautiful story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is the best of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (she should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil and despicable characters in the history of cinema (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another unpleasant character. I'm always amazed by the incredible variety of characters that John Hurt can interpret. This is the story of a money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-taught person who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And this is basically what this story is about; honor of the common man against the corruption of the nobility. This movie is a lot of fun, it should appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, beautiful landscapes and has an exciting storyline. One of my favorite movies
