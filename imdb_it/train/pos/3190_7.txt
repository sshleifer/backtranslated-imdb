This is your standard 1930s musical comedy, with a great advantage that presents some well-known actors from the 1930s in a small entertaining cameo. <br /> <br /> There isn't much to the story and in practice the film is all about its genre of fun general atmosphere and "no worries", with a typical comedy twist by Hal Roach. Appereantly is a "Cinderella story" but I certainly didn't think of it that way while watching the movie. The plot becomes very confused with the narration, which presents many different characters and also many small cameos, when the main characters reach the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Obviously the highlight of the film is when Laurel & Hardy looks and shows some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting Laurel & Hardy for free. Even Laurel & Hardy, the regular Walter Long, makes his appearance in the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as director of the short. <br /> <br /> It is certainly true that all cameos and subplots distract from the plot and the main character, but in this case it is not a problem, since it is always more fun and interesting to see than the plot main and characteristic main character. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly not worse than any of its other genre films of the same period, although the evaluation here would suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
