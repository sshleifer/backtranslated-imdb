What can I say about the first film ever? <br /> <br /> You can't vote on this, because it shouldn't be fun. But if you have to evaluate it, you should give it a 10. It's wonderful to see moving images dating back to the year 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder how one of the people who saw the first movie ever was! <br /> <br />
