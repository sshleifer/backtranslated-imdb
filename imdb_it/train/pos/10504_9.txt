Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very interesting game for the N64. Bowser lives up to his usual cheating (yes, it's a stupid word but the only one I can think of) and Mario has to stop it again. This game is very fun to play and contains a lot of nostalgia for me. The only negative thing is the graphics, which is terrible by today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the small minigames you can unlock). It's the second best game for N64 (the first is Conker's Bad Fur Day) I recommend to any Mario fan or fan of platform games. Overcome the mediocre Super Mario Sunshine every day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
