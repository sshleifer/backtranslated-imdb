I've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s; some terribly bad, and others have thought of really provoking and frightening. Soylent Green fits into this last category. Yes, sometimes it's a bit of a camper, and yes, the furniture is good for a laugh or two, but some movies seem terribly prescient. Here we have a film, 9 years before Blade Runner, that dares to imagine the future as something dark, scary and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson go much better in this respect than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assisted suicide scene is disturbingly prescient of Kevorkian and his peers. Some attitudes are dated (can you imagine a filmmaker who runs away with the concept of "women as furniture" in our 90s so politically correct?), But it is rare to find a film based on Me Decade that can actually make you think that I'd like to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, I don't think the general purpose of this movie could get its due. Check it out.
