I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I haven't seen it yet, but I shudder at the thought of someone actually paying to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did that year. The fact is that they probably changed it. Especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke from a Mexican prostitute's tits (probably they should have followed him around). We've made some that come and go, but other than that, I really can't remember anything. I've been the MC in some scenes (from what I've been told. What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the TV crew because whoever wants to be remembered as the guy who raised or the girl who showed her her world (or the girl the loser lost his virginity to) The whole journey itself was crazy but people behave differently once the camera is on them.
