"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of the 1980s for John Hughes' teen movies. Everything takes place in a colorful world of chewing gum where everyone is attractive, there are some easily resolved conflicts that occasionally take away the proceeding mostly happy, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop songs. Nothing wrong with that, though. "Bend It Like Beckham" is a true delight from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally captivated by the cornball's generosity even though we were fooling ourselves, and in the end, as embarrassing as it may be, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and have fun. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
