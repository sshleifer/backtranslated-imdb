This stupid movie is really fun for the younger audience. His heroes are a couple of detested who, with their sophomoric attitude, lead on very silly roads. Pursuing the great murder case, you will see these investigators go to all lengths to solve the crime. No nudity, but a lot of sexual implications, crap nonsense ... everything that teenagers do. Low budget, but very fun. Classical cult potential defined.
