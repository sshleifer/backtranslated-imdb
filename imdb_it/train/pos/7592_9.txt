I just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my opinion (and justice) to the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, to be honest, this film is not pretending to be anything but a solid comedy action. It is not meant to revolutionize the film industry and gather acclaimed critics, nor does it want to be considered as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, I suggest you discard your critical mind and your desire for a good storyline because you won't find anyone here. With the established one, let's go further in the film. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this film simply because it didn't have a strong plot (Yes, the viewer, I underestimated this film too), but I never expected that I liked this movie very much. I also liked this more than the Stephen Chow films (which I find the Kung Fu Hustle to be his best effort and would also rank him a 9). The action is intense and epic while the comedy suffocates in the right places. <br /> <br /> Alert SPOILERS, I think the action could be unreal, but why should I still watch a serious basketball movie? There are many other sports films (drama) that have already done well, why create another? End SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and watch it. Just remember, don't think: just look, have fun, smile, laugh, and each time (the film industry) creates masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, and sometimes they create films that look better on the landfill pile. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have, again, if we're talking about Stephen Chow's comedy, this is a top ten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you love: - no brains movie with a good action - Kung Fu - Death Trance - Kung Fu and comedy - what the heck, look at this. you will have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you the cast of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
