I love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and I've seen every single episode. I remember when I sat at 6:00 pm every night and waited for him to come to Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left high school the show began to fall. The best series must be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one she is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still very good, but when he left high school it didn't seem right. It seemed that all the main characters were gone, which meant that he didn't have the same "spark", however the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when the aunt leaves and Sabrina moving into their home is not right. She is no longer a teenager, so the show's name is not right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone who isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he arrived in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all, I still like to watch old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because later the show has definitely lost some of its magic
