An excellent film that shows the pathetic life of two old brats. They could not live together, nor separated. Constantly mumbling, sometimes at the same time, they have erased and re-hashed the past; going on and on about what coulda shouldaa woulda. Sometimes I found myself laughing, but for the most part I was taken by how deeply sad and abandoned these two women were. See this.
