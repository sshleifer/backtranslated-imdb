My left foot is an exceptional epic film that explains the life and times of Christy Brown, who had a cerebral palsy, a severe disability and had only the use of the left foot, but was rebellious, managed to become an artist and writer against all odds <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie a lot, and every time I see it, I find it equally brilliant every time. I wonder how this incredible film did not win an Oscer for the best film, it is a sham from the Academy awards. Jim Shirdan is for me one of the greatest directors in the world. The script, the music and everything else is excellent in this film. As the film goes on, you would feel almost like you were in the brown family like everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are as incredible as Cristies' parents and Fiona Shaw is just as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in her battle of challenge. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry noticed long before my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in Irish cinema. films as powerful and brilliant as the field, the game of crying, in the name of the father and Michael Collins, followed my left foot. These Irish films have been considered so popular all over the world and have been nominated for multiple Oscers and won some, a wonderful time for the Irish film. My left foot is an exceptional and powerful film. <br /> <br /> Daniel day-lewis plays the lame Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh or Conner who plays the young Christy.To those two performances are two of the best cinematic performances of all time, in especially the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that I would consider as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has shown in his career to be a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent masterpiece in the film, watch it!
