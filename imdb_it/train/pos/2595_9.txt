Brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues by Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in recreating the captivating portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to celebrate - two-way understood! Director Bravo Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as casting director and director of photography in the creation of this masterpiece. The novel by Gunter Grass, The Tin Drum filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another film adaptation of the inner monologue that I prefer to compare with Strick's film. <br /> <br /> While the monuments of Dublin and the film are clearly recognized in the original novel, there are also recognizable characters, albeit with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, appears to be a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film for all its excellences is made even richer by further visualizations. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15th 2008
