Huge, comprehensive and passionate summary of American cinema seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment in all its 4 hour duration. Many genres, periods and directors are all examined, discussed more from the cinephile perspective than from the contemporary director. For anyone even remotely interested in American films or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best of BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
