When Sabrina first arrived on our screens I was about 12 years old, so I spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch enter all kinds of strange situations. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite programs, the feeling of sorcery of the sixties sitcom "bewitched" but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was intelligent. She was also friendly and easy, which made her pleasant to look at. The characters at the beginning were fantastic; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the quiz master, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fave, too bad he left so soon) Hilda and Zelda her aunts started well, but then got angry. <br /> <br /> I liked it Mr. Kraft was always a little closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I liked about the first three series were the original ideas, the discovery of the family secret and the learning of new spells, but as it progressed it became more predictable. Too many characters have come and gone, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad and then decided to do Sabrina in college who ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina became self-absorbed in college, there was less magic, no spell book, no aunt who lived with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring, and I only saw to see what happened at the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong in some way and Miles had just gone off like that. The last episode made me feel much better even though (SPOILER) having Sabrina end up with Harvey on his wedding day for dullard Aaron was great! Overall a great program if you forget the scarce two or three series that reminded me of so many shows for teenagers. Magical.
