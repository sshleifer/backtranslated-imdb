I'm a big fan of the film, but not for the usual reasons. I think that Travolta and Winger played at above average rates, I think the sets were representative of the location and era, I liked the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think photography was fantastic! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the current club and Gilley had low ceilings - maybe 10-12 feet tall and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke filled bar" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dances, the low level of light that actually was in the bar! What a feat! Of course, there was auxiliary lighting, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low light shots. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was great! He got some shots that he had no hope of getting and the impact of these brought a sense of reality into the film. Thanks, Ray - Great job!
