Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's List was excellent. A great watch for children and adults of all kinds. The large noses can be seen as a reference to the phallic symbols, in the same way as H.R. Puff N Stuff had mentioned smoking marijuana. Your kids will love this movie. I loved it as a child. My father showed me this film as a child. He also enjoyed himself and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although at the time I had no idea what those were. The film is comedy and adventure. The plot is extravagant and cheerful. You and I will enjoy this together.
