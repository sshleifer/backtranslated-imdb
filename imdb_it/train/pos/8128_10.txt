I saw it for the first time as a child living in East London. Hitler Luftwaffe's scars were all too obvious and the film's landscape reminded us of our way. I remember having nightmares after seeing him. The strange thing is that it is not dated if viewed as a piece of social history in Cinema fiction. <br /> <br /> In addition to a worldwide destructive war, the scale of the machines was seriously bleak, more Nano-Technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-done job. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived then. I would think that shooting a spacecraft from a giant gun would almost certainly kill astronauts. However, much was right. Man's desire for war, inhumanity. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
