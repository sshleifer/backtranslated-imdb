I don't think I'll ever understand hatred for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was beautiful, and gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most fantastic action films of all time. That's right, you crazy little ones, the "Cliffhanger" rules, and we all know it. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescuer who is 'visiting' his old city when asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps in a rescue on a peak of mountain. Walker obviously returned at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they lost a lot of money they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they would really like to come back ... <br /> <br /> Essentially, "Cliffhanger" is another clone of "Die Hard" . Just swap the boundaries of Nakatomi Plaza with the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, with scenes created to highlight the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Of course, this set is completely torn to shreds pretty soon, since the character of Stallone avoids a rather high number of bullets with ease, and slams face to face on different rock faces without apparent side effects. After all, isn't that what action movies are? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action films out there. A showcase of great scenes and acrobatics. One of the first stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the film hasn't improved since the beginning, it retains its impressive action. John Lithgow's villain is fun and a bad guy. Most likely one of the worst villains of all time. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, certainly the best effort of Renny Harlin, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
