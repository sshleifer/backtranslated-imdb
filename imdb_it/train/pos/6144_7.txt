I saw it when I was on The Wonderful World of Disney as a child, so I didn't remember much about it. As I watched him recently, I sat there thinking, "This is the strangest thing I've seen." <br /> <br /> "Traveling" scenes seem to be something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are for the most part strangely colored / expressed versions of characters from Jungle Book and Robin Hood. Some not-so-Disney things I noticed: children threatened with knives and prostitutes (during the Portobello Road song). <br /> <br /> It was a lot of fun, even if the musical numbers were long and I can hardly see the kids getting bored with them. Also, the mode in question was a bit dark, since it was set during the Second World War.
