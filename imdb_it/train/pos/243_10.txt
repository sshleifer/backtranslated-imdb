Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all the technical details (especially the cinematography) are sharp and the script is smart. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is as exceptional as Edward "Ned" Kelly. It's as compelling as the legendary outlaw and is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are bet <br /> <br /> The film is a thrilling game to the end. One of my favorite films of the late legend Heath Ledger, which was the highlight of every movie he starred in. And it makes no mistakes here. <br /> <br /> An excellent all-round film.
