A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the small British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". It marks the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before that little film about the uncontrollable passion in 19th-century English moors. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suited to screwball comedy, everything flows well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up with the annoyed divorce lawyer Logan (Olivier) in a bad English fog that prevents the journey. He does everything he can to irritate him - but, in the crazy way the movies go, he falls in love with her. And she falls in love with him. But a grave case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (which is all she leaves in a note to Oliver) is thought of by Olivier as a married woman. To make matters worse, and more amusing, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier who wants to divorce his wife that dear Larry thinks should be Oberon! There is a nice dialogue between sex battles and fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too confident with comedy, but in real Olivier is a consummate professional and offers. And he takes care of the withered twists, perhaps not with ease, but with taste. Oberon was not a big shake as an actress, but he was usually quite competent, and despite his unfamiliar fame, he worked well with Olivier. This was shot in the first Technicolor which looks very primitive today (everyone still looks whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the print has to be clean.
