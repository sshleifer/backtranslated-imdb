Having worked in central Manhattan and often ate my lunch on summer days in the park near the town hall, I saw the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to go beyond the doors of the town hall and see how it looked in the hall and across the entire building. "Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas)," Gigli ", '03, gave an exceptional performance across the whole picture, and especially when he gave a speech in an African American Church for a child who was killed. (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", '03, was a devoted servant of the mayor and adores him in all that he has attempted to accomplish. Supporting role: Last, but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", 01, played a mafia boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture! great acting and fantastic photography in New York!
