One of the smartest serial killers in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative vision in the background and the story of one of the most famous serial killers. The directors create an unexpected discovery of the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to find out more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not at all crazy but very methodical and a self-promoter. The director here plays the expectations of the spectators and pulls him out. The film is built as a yellow murder or a cold case-style thriller. It is an intelligent-style investigative / procedural horror film that will put gore-hounds out of business in search of chills at low cost. <br /> <br /> Some people don't like any movie shot on video. This attitude is very old-fashioned and provincial. It is an attitude and a vision of film that poses technical problems above the value of entertainment or artistic value. These attitudes are endangered. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but the most demanding viewers will look further and find a carefully crafted gem.
