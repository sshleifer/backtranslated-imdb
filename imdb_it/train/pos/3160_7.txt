This show has all the typical characters of a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's set in the 70s. This is the only difference he has with other television comedies. I don't know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so straightforward ... A typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (Audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (The audience applauds and applauds) "This is not funny. I think if he didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call it in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This is not an intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but it's not good at all. I would give 4 out of 10. (Sorry again for my poor English).
