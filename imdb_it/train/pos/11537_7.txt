Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue and nowhere is this more evident than the lines that WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON interpret as opposites in THE ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of two similar friends who share a flat. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is Neatnik Felix Ungar, determined to commit suicide after divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says and pushes Oscar to the wall and neither can bear the opposite, given that Oscar is the most threatening male imaginable and Felix the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene for me was when he chuckled. The pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them for dinner. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to make you right. The talented Pigeon sisters are the girls who made the voices for the Gabble Sisters (a pair of geese) in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here - their comic rhythm atop the sad story of Lemmon's desperation is enough to make the film in hilarity - where it remains most of the time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and have enjoyed other treatments for the screen of his work, this is not to be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly expressed (although they have taken into account the exchange of roles before the start of filming) and, of course, it is easy to understand why it has become a high-level television show later. <br /> <br /> To sum up: Top The comedy of Simon, not to be missed.
