I saw him on a flight to the United States and at first I was a bit skeptical because some people said there were so many characters that you didn't know any of them. However, I didn't find it at all. The film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but it's not true for most movies. The main villain is a little disappointed, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but this is still a good movie.
