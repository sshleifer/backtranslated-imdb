At the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says he was told he has two attacks against him: he is black and male. But beyond that, he has a third attack: he's gay. "You will have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he is told. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about black gays and Hispanic men who are transvestite or transsexual. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that director Jennie Livingston takes up a topic that could easily become a bizarre spectacle and allows people in it their humanity. We learn their opinions on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that it is tragic. Many people are seriously denying; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this nude transsexual movie. If you have a problem with homosexuality, this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie you will realize that "Paris is Burning" is not about men who wear women's clothes, it is a group of people who are usually marginalized and brought to their knees by society in general, and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says so many things: it's a commentary on materialism in our culture, on gender roles, on the rich and the poor, on the media and on what it celebrates, on fame and flattery. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most human and saddest films I've ever seen.
