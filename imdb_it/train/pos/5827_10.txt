This three-shot film is balanced with my other favorite movie "Disorder in the Court". This is a riot of laughter for Three Stooges fans. </ P> The boys are janitors in a recording studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre singing a great version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a record deal, but she is scarred for being honest with her father about her career choice and proving to be a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the minions decide to have some fun and play her record and dress Curly like Christine. The contract woman who can make Christine's career sees Curly and trades him for Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Obviously there is a man who got angry at the party and destroys his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to get them back. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful flick fancy, this should not be lost! <br /> <br /> 10/10
