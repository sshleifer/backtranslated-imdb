This is an excellent and heartbreaking movie. It is by far the best I have seen describing the current reality in Latin America ... kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and heartless chaos towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most exciting performances in his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an incredible young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed it every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is as big as ever. Walken turns on the screen for me like no other actor. I would have liked to see more of them both. The authentic positions are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, which makes it even more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
