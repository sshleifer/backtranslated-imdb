Hitchcock shows his understanding already developed for images in this first silent film. The plot of the film, which involves two boxers fighting for a girl, is a direct drama without much to recommend. Hitchcock's talent, however, lies in his astonishing use of images. Almost every shot is full of visual symbols. Particularly memorable is the jewel a boxer gives the girl just before marrying the other boxer. He slips it down his arm in a clearly sexual way and with a simple movement Hitch showed us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are well managed with some interesting shots from the point of view that still show how much he was ahead of Hitchcock's time. The film also gives an idea of ​​his subsequent treatment for women. The object of boxers' desires is driven by money and lust, not by reason or love. The only other women in the film are beautiful party girls who make open sex offers or old old ones that help destroy happy relationships. All in all, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller.
