I just hope that Return of the Jedi was directed by someone else, I mean, there are too many ewoks scenes, completely useless. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda dies. <br /> <br /> But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that I really can't hate. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The attack sequence of Sail Barge. 3-The emperor (now he is evil) 4- The Speeders chase the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The scene of seduction on the dark side. 7 - Anakin's return to the good side of force. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of these are so beautiful that they can bring tears to the eyes. If some scenes had been cut and another director hired, this would have been as perfect as episodes 4 and 5, but it's still extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
