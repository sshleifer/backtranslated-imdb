This is the best Chinese film I've ever seen and, in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of different genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movies, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most surprising thing is that he can really do all this! <br /> <br /> This film is certainly among my top 5, and should be enjoyable for any movie lover. Action sequences have the traditional unrealistic jump and even flight, but the way it is shot differs greatly from Hero's style and the flight always looks nice and usually makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, you won't regret it. 10/10
