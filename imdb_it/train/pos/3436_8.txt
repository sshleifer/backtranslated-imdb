Letters without destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice manages to land a job in hopes of finding her lost father. What he finds is the tormented soul of his boss, Frank. A little Australian fox who came and went to the cinema. Now you find him in the dark and dark corner of the video library, obscured by fifty copies of that dreaded GODZILLA film. It's a pity because this turned out to be a satisfying film that tells a brave story with simple and strong images and effective performances by the two protagonists. This film was successful when the other dead letter office of Garry Marshall DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed, and approaches the splendor of, not the turkey of Kevin Costner, but of POSTMAN (1995 - China) of He Jianjun.
