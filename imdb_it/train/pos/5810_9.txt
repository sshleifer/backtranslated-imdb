Mr. Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short films, that is music videos, are simply the best. I don't care if I get a sci-fi character from this man, but I'm interested in having a mixture of his crazy dances, shrill screams, fascinating choreographies of the crowd and some fragments of CGI and animation. There should also be some unbroken videos. Everything I've mentioned is here. The stupid plot and the exaggerated "vanity fair" are not a problem when I witness Mr. Michael Jackson in action. For me it will always be the last king of music videos (not the "king of pop" that sounds like crazy, especially for us Russians, because "pop" sounds like the Russian word "donkeys" and MJ is definitely not "the king" of donkeys "). I can see his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this film was "What is this ...?" (fragments of different videos, some images drawn, upsetting jumps from one theme to another, absence of any coherent plot, some kids joking, etc.) but while I watched him until the end, I could tell he was fantastic and really nothing like any other shown on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows shameful material and can be easily watched by children. <br /> <br /> Without Mr. Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot get close to the energetic hyperbole of musical madness and the artistic quality of MJ. He knew how to get the public of different eras and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I see a correct version of DVD with videos of Michael Jackson I know it deserves to be bought even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous version. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are all fantastic, even if only "Moonwalker" is more like a movie (with a solid "Smooth Criminal" theme, "paparazzi" and some strange parodies and twists <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of MJ I can still give this "movie ... like no other" a solid 9 out of 10 (I was hit by "Smooth Criminal" for sure and my complaints more important are the following: initial segments of the film may have been eliminated while the main "MJ anti-drug campaign" should have received more "madness and senselessness of the sky" and of course there should have been more "moonwalking" itself. .
