This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great backgrounds and sets. 2) It showed the disparity of an environment torn by war alongside the technological one. 3) John Cusack's acting was fantastic. He interpreted anguish very well. 4) Show everyone's vulnerabilities in a war-torn situation. 5) He gave us a picture of what could happen in the future in many ways. I was also impressed by the acting for the most part. Hilary's acting was, I found it, the craziest. The moral and values ​​of everyone in a war-torn situation are at stake. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Big things. PSP
