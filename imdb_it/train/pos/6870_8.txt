From start to finish, I laughed very hard for the whole movie. It is incredible that "The Groove Tube" is probably the grandfather, and yet raunchiest, of all comic script films. That's how I like to watch TV without getting bored of throwing the channels just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, the strange, strange humor never stops! Think about how all these meaningless laughs can help you enjoy life more easily! It's much, much better than Comedy Central or a prime-time show! Do yourself a favor and transgress all those soft and limping romantic comedy movies in the wastebasket! Better yet, tell your box office that you want "The Groove Tube" on the big screen!
