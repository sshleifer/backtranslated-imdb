A woman left alone after her husband's death finds herself attracted by her son's friend and practical man. In a slightly twisted story, the woman begins to sleep with the practical man in an attempt to revive herself. The twisted part? The man within reach is also his daughter's love interest. <br /> <br /> As if this were not strange enough, the mother manages to fall in love with this man and when his daughter finds out, he blames her not only for her dysfunctional relationship but also for her messy life on her poor mother. <br /> <br /> Even if you could think badly of this woman, the truth is that the film manages to portray her in a positive light. Beautifully played by Anne Reid, this character has a dimension and portrays great emotion. <br /> <br /> A truly brilliant performance and a fun movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
