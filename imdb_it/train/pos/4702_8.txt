If this movie only shows one thing, it's that Keaton is, was and always will be a comedian at heart, even when dodging bullets, he heads for the electric chair and finds himself in the wrong part of a prison information line. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" continues to show even more. In the 1980s, the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the pinnacle in the genre parody world. But there were many pretenders to the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High") Heckerling grabs her hand, with an incredible amount of television writers behind the script (go see). <br /> <br /> This slap-happy parody of the 1930s movie of the "gag-cops" throws virtually every cliché for a cycle and also adds some clichés that didn't exist before. <br /> <br /> And not only is Keaton always available as Johnny's title, but so are characters and funny dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost every other Hollywood actor that happened to walk in the immediate vicinity. You would be surprised by how many faces you will recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? Well, when they start, they come to you fast and furious, like a machine gun. There are too many to count at the beginning, complemented by a crazy song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to watch when they recharge. And they have to recharge a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody's looking, they seem to be having fun and I was laughing a good amount of time. In the end, though, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been more fun - it's usually not the best thing to think about after seeing a play. <br /> <br /> But for a slow evening when there's nothing good on TV, pop in "Johnny" and be ready for some "Dangerously" serious laughter. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check "Johnny Dangerously" ... don't be a "bastidge".
