As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, this takes place along the smallest plots. For some reason - oh it's explained! - has been selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good boys and villains compete for the mine and who is the one who gets confused. But, as always, Powell's dance is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this Lahr recites his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of that 1939 Technicolor movie. A marginal benefit is to listen to a young Frank, with that marvelous thin voice and vulnerability he abandoned for his wise character later. Moreover, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time exhibiting his virtuosity. Look in particular for his one-time duet with Dorsey's trumpet man, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique" perhaps in ignorance, but I don't know any other drum / trumpet sequences like this on film or discs. This movie is fun. Even the silly Skelton character is relatively moderate. Powell again shows that he is the greatest dancer ever.
