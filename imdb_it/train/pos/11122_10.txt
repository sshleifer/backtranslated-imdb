When we started watching this series on cable, I had no idea how compelling it was. Even when you hate a character, you hold yourself back because they are so well developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation like they do. It's almost as if the viewer were experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Adriana endured Christopher's abuse of her, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and will tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would like to give up a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I look. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find something you missed the first five times. We also watch episodes out of sequence (watch season 1 late at night with commercials but the whole language, A & E with censored language, replicas on the Movie Network) - every time they are active, we are there. We have been totally spoiled now. <br /> <br /> I also like Malaprops. "An albacore al collo" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary, it is a sign that I should get a life. I'll do it when the series ends, and I've collected all the DVDs, and put the collection in my will.
