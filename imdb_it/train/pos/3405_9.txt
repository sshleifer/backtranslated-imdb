"The Garden of Allah" was one of the first feature films in 3-strip Technicolor film. To correct a previous poster, the first feature of Technicolor (after Disney's five-year agreement) was "Becky Sharp" in 1935, a costume drama that used color for its flashy color costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of Allah" seems as if it could have been shot years later, because cinematography uses not only color but also the use of shadows. It must have been surprising for an audience at that time to see a color film after seeing only black and white films throughout their lives. Unfortunately, the film does not stand up to cinematography. That said, the film deserves to be seen only as a visual surprise.
