I loved this movie! I am biased because I am a big Disney fan, but I really enjoyed it. The action kicks off at the beginning of the film and continues to move forward! This is a bit of a starting point for Disney, they don't spend enough time developing the character (my husband pointed it out) and there are no musical numbers. It is a strictly action adventure. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, whether they are young or old.
