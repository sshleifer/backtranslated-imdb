Leonard Maltin must have seen some other films. (Although I find his guide a rather valuable resource, please ignore his comments on this.) He declares that "it starts well and then vanishes" when it really is the opposite - "start tepid and then catch fire". The plot is as simple as it becomes. Happy mom, happy dad and happy son take a vacation in a secluded beach, father incapable in accident, mom runs away for help, meets with a dangerous escaped prisoner. Mom tries to trick the inmate to help while Dad waits and freezes for life. <br /> <br /> Good candid, given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker, it suddenly appears (the director, John Sturges, takes it in a clever film that will make you wince) halfway like the crafty and desperate criminal. Meeker is an unusually irreverent and reckless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and happily grabs the keys to the film's narrative and shortens with top down. His character has a habit of smiling in a childish way and saying "Pretty clean, eh?" when he is particularly happy with his misdeeds. There is a fun break in the action when they get a flat tire and give instructions to his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Don't go away." She replies "Where could I go?" (I'm in the middle of nowhere) and makes sitcom-ishly "Yes, it's true". The friction between them is a hoot. <br /> <br /> There are flaws, somehow ridiculous. There is a scene where the police, who chased Meeker for a while, stop Stanwyck's car and to escape detection Meeker rests his head on his shoulder as a loving husband would have supposed, and pretends to be asleep while he is questioned. A. He definitely looks non-masculine in this pose and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to be asleep during a meeting with law enforcement agencies would definitely arouse suspicion. <br /> <br /> Still a robust thriller based on an exciting and uplifting conclusion. <br /> <br />
