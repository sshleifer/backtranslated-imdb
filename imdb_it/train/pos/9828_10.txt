I'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's a great zombie movie full of action, original ideas, good acting, but it's also full of evil Zombie effects. Part IV, entitled "After death", is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans all over the world. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Horror movie fans like this should see Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
