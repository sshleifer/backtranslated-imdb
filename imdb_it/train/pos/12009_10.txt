I really thought they had done an * excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with all this, I don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible, it moved me to tears (I guess he moved on all up to tears) but I try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing, but this took me. It was amazing! I hope they publish it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! It seems to me that he has renewed my faith and given me a hope that I cannot explain, made me want to be a better person, have gone through so much and we take it for granted, I guess. Compared to this, I feel like our tests were nothing. Well, nothing, but they don't agree with what they had to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma?!
