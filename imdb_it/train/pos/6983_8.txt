I loved it, having been a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the backstory would be - I never failed to delight myself. I also like the fact that, apart from Eric Stoltz, he doesn't recognize a person: it's refreshing, very similar to BSG. He introduced me to a whole series of new talents: I can't wait for the series to start shooting. Congratulations to Ronald D. Moore and the team - excellent work. The special effects, dialogue and acting were all aimed, and I felt emotionally tied up in the plot. I know there are purists out there who probably won't agree with my assessment, but I've heard that Caprica was far superior to most of the science fiction things produced over the last decade.
