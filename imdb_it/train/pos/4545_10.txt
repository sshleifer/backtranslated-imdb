I saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head still ached to laugh. The plot was really bad, the jokes were really bad, but the one I didn't count on was: <br /> <br /> 1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie with Pat and Jay posing (which caused more of a laugh) <br /> <br /> 2. The kick through the windshield that beheaded the villain. <br /> <br /> This film is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy also came with a popularizer who said if you didn't like the movie, send certificate to HBO. While I considered it, the date on which you had to send it was January 1991 (which also caused the insecurity).
