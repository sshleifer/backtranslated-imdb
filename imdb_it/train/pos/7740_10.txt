It is rare that you come across an impeccable film like this. It's really one of the most played and structured films I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in different ways, in relation to each of the three main characters in a different way. The film weaves an intrinsic network of motivations and double crosses that roll you and refuse to let go. Add to that the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything that has ever been entrusted to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. Exposes the romance of films like "Titanic" as trite clich√©s. If you are looking for a movie to watch while you put your laundry away, this is not it. You must engage in this film. You can't have a conversation while you're running in and out of the room. This film requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you will derive much from it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the greatest movie ever.
