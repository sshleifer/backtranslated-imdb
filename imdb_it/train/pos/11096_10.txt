Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: a businessman is blackmailed by 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job as the main character and the special merit of going to John Glover who plays a sort of bad psychopath. I have to say that the characters of the criminals are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action movie. also presents some beautiful and sexy women - the most important are Kelly Preston as the young friend of the character of Schieder. Vanity offers excellent performance and appearance like the prostitute who is connected with the three blackmailers. I'm happy to say that Ann-Margaret hasn't lost it yet - this lady is a real girl. Don't watch the rate of this movie. I really don't know what the public and some critics are about this film, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really compelling and undervalued movie. You'll like it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
