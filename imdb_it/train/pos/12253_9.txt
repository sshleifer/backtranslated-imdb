This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although it is certainly not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Austen's novel - especially considering its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is good, since the useless snobbery that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more like Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters chosen to play the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale walks on the thin line between childhood and the social snob with a grace completely lost in the 1996 version of Gwyneth Paltrow. Samantha Morton's blonde locks adapt to her attitude and character while the simulator that accompanies her role in previous characterizations is replaced by the Harriet we know from the book. The role of Mr. Knightly is very well done in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion with which the hero is depicted in the novel are present here in this very neglected and sumptuous film.
