This is a sublime film. It flows at the right pace all the time. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasing to the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and made even more by the largely sadly tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> However, despite many comments on the intrinsic tragedy of the plot, for me it was far from depressing to watch. I really liked it in a way that I didn't live for a long time. That is to say, it is superb and yet without all the common symbols of modern films such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> 'Dan In Real Life' has nothing to do with normal vices. It has a completely mature texture that just does not require, and indeed would be ruined by, any further embellishment. At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. It is a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want nothing else from what it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a little like Waltons, but in reality they make perfect sense in the long run while counteracting the most dysfunctional moments. The most rosy gives way to the tragic, which then abandons itself to the idyllic that becomes the most obscure, etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of stability similar to lithium. The peaks and depressions are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie regardless of the genre you normally like. Put aside any prejudice because it is a must see!
