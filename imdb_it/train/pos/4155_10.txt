What an extraordinary episode for this beautiful series. This is the excellence of television at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully filmed in black and white, almost like a noir film with its deep shadows and bare images. This is a story of two men who fall in love, but I don't want to ruin it. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their mutual love and their tragedy. Facing such a delicate problem makes this episode even more surprising. Our emotions are torn and tangled like the characters. Eventually the chills hit me in the back when they played the role of Bob Dylan: "Ah, but I was much older then, I'm younger than now", as sung by the Byrds. This goes beyond 10 and up to the stars. Very beautifull.
