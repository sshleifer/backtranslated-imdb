This film is not about entertainment, or even a movie you want to watch to pass the time. This film is a true demonstration of true love that can only come from God. You can't help but be deeply touched by watching this movie. We have different dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is the divine love of God that is beautifully represented. God's love transcends the heart and the mind and resists and is eternal. There is love in a marriage. While the main character is struggling with his wife's illness, he realizes through the love of God that he loves his wife more than he can ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of a child and a parent. The children of the family meet and understand that nothing but love overcomes fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love is not good unless it is given to another. I pray that this film will inspire and change the lives of anyone who sees it. Amen!!
