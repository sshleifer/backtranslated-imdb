This movie is really good. The plot, which works like a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings many surprises and makes the viewer really looking forward to finding a solution to a riddle. The fighting scenes are very good. There are many different fighting styles (although one of the styles was a bit unreal for me, but that's just my opinion) to watch and it's a fascinating sight. The only thing that can be irritating is to watch the actors. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at kung-fu movies, especially in the 70s and 80s, so "Five Venom" (or other versions of it) is a great choice.
