Does anyone else cry when they watch this movie? I love it! One of my 10 best films of all time. It makes me feel good. I look at the production closing number with all the cast members over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE FESTIVAL of the film, IMHO! I've never seen the play, but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The film making process rarely provides a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe that it is only because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen have not changed more than they are. This is a great movie, it's very satisfying. It's all you need to know!
