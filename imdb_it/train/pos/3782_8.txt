When I was a child, I totally loved both Bill & Ted Movies. The other night, Bogus Journey was active and since at least 5 years had passed since I last saw it, I decided to tune in. AND THE LOVED IT ALL! This movie is still fun after all these years. 'The excellent adventure' is better, but this does the same. Of course, some of the performances are a bit rough, but hey, this whole movie is cool in style. It also features the most beautiful personation of Death ever in a movie! In conclusion: Totally like a fake movie guy! Excellent way! RAILWAY STATION!!!
