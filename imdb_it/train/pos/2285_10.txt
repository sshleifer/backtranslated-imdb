I did not read this book, but throughout the film I was struck by a single thought in my head: it is so Vonnegut. I have never seen an author, all the intelligence and life behind the work of a novel, translated so well into cinema. This film had the same complexity as the novels of Vonnegut: the jokes were often significant and symbolic, and the events and dramatic symbols were often also jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, played perfectly by Nick Nolte. He had all the characteristics of a "hero" of Vonnegut: lack of interest in political boundaries, ironic obscure humor that gave way to stupid inactivity in response to stress, and a reluctance to push his version of reality onto those around him. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed while watching this movie. It was the same feeling that I had read "Cat's Cradle", my first novel by Vonnegut, as if the strangest thing that could happen, he thought of THAT, and made it real and important. Yes, it has nothing but "White Christmas" album in military surplus. That's how it went!
