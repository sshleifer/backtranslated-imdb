Theodore Rex is perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of all time, and it is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns with the great directors of the twentieth century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing short of amazing and make any Spielberg work look trivial and elementary. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary jewel that raised the level of cinema to levels never expected by the directors. The concept of creating not only a movie with a dinosaur, but of adapting an action-packed and thrilling detective novel, with a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name like "Theodore" and an existential female police officer changed humanity as the we know. The world could never be the same after having experienced such a magnificent beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is a lot like looking at God and hearing him say "you are my most beloved creation". This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR !!!
