This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and now I'm passionate! Okay so it requires the adoption of a different mindset to watch American movies, but once you give yourself the pleasure of enjoying yourself for what it is, you won't be disappointed. The songs are superb, melodic and very catchy. The actors are visually convincing, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses in the world of cinema. The positions, the colors are lovely. If you want something different and you're trying to be uplifted, cheered and stimulated, I suggest you take this movie.
