although this film is quite old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> a particular quote in the film stands out. <br /> <br /> when Danny (Joe Piscopo) arrives at the office and parks in a disabled place, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "can't park here, it's for the handicapped" . <br /> <br /> Danny answers "I'm handicapped, I'm psychotic". <br /> <br /> is one of the many lines of the film that no matter how many times you look, it's "I'll make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously is in my top comedy / spoof of all timing. <br /> <br /> As an added bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the die cast, so watch this movie and, like me and many others who have seen it, you will be enchanted.
