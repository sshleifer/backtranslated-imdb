Even though I live in Minnesota, I recently studied in France and came across this bizarre gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> This film was amazing, to say the least. A creative and unique film, the different directors have lent something different to their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to insert each of these little stories into an overall plot, as can be done with Love Actually from 2003. This attempt, however, makes the magic of every single segment obsolete. If taken at face value, with each of the short segments taken as an individual film, the love stories together tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The film is surprisingly bizarre at times - often to the point of confusion - and every single segment can be difficult to follow. However, for an observer who pays particular attention to each of the segments, the short weft lines become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost intriguing; keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next. Let the viewer wonder "is it really happening?" however, it also leaves them satisfied that it has actually occurred. It is the kind of film in which the viewer, when leaving the theater, cannot really decide whether he loved it or hated it. The first reaction is to go and see it again and again, only to see these individual lives fuse together in a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make the film multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people it can relate to. Adds to the reality of the film - here, American tourists speak English, French Parisians and so on. The number of people that the film contains leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From the disease to the supernatural, from the love of parents to the love of husbands, this film covers all the basics of romantic storytelling. In its beautiful and bizarre way, every single event is placed in some way to tell a story: that of all types, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
