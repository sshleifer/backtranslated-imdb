The fascist principal Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is photographed by the expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she were ten feet tall) has a plan to make her completely square. The result is the complications that challenge this goal in the delightful rock'n'roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles who illuminates the screen - he also has a warm body) who is an obsessive fan of punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big rimmed glasses and nerd role can't hide his splendid beauty) joins Riff to end the alleged crisis of killing rock'n'roll forever, which is the mission he wants of Togar. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has an exhilarating role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything but fuck. Kate is crazy about Tom ... if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honestly, who can steal this film away from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, "the supplier" who can get almost everything. His office is in the boy's bathroom! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff when he enjoys a concert by THE RAMONES. <br /> <br /> A lively puzzle that challenges all the rules of normality ... and I loved it. It is as if someone were saying "Let's make life for 1 and a half hours". The film is truly anarchy ... a chaos without plot that lovingly loves THE RAMONES with all my heart (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to win new audiences with this film). <br /> <br /> The end almost sums up the film as a whole. Regarding his classmates, high school takes over and a big party begins. To be honest, I didn't want the party to end! Unconventional in any way, this film lets go of delirium. Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack with some of the best songs of THE RAMONES, this film allows a spectator to accept a moment in life when the war has not dominated the titles and the people have had fun. Those, I guess it was the days.
