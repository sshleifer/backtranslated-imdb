This show is good. I like acting, funny pieces and the sweetness of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel, etc., were all fantastic in the show. The show started off great with its fun and illogical basic idea of ​​reporting deaths in the first series and honestly, as people used to say, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit disappointing, but it came back well anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why does ABC not let it finish until the end when all the episodes have already been done ?? I really want to know what the story will be like. I think he should be given a chance because there are still so many spectators who love him.
