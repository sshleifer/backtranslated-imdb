In addition to Susan Hayward's wooden delivery throughout the film, it was as perfect as any other biblical film made. Henry King manages this film with the respect of an epic in all the small scenes and Peck is, as always, impeccable. The soundtrack of Alfred Newman's sound, with the exciting twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after so many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hockey side, but that's not all that was hurt for the era this movie was made. This goes hand in hand with the minor biblical epics of the time, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King". It is worth watching and Raymond Massy is as excellent as the prophet Nathan. The film is complemented by the ever good James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows in the role of Michol, David's first estranged wife.
