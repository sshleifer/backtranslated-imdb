The "Inspirational" stories about the "triumph of the human spirit" are usually great shortcuts for me. The most surprising thing about MEN OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it despite everything. The film is predictable and clich√©, but it works. Much credit goes to the exciting performances of both protagonists. It's a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is wonderfully sober here. We expect a lot from De Niro and do not disappoint. Create an obscurely funny portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. set out to make an old-fashioned movie and get a winner.
