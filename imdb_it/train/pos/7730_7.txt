If in the 90s you are adapting a book written in the 50s, you set the bloody thing in the 50s and not in the 90s. See, the costumes and values ​​of 40 years tend not to sound as good, or sound like real, so far down the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood continues to violate routinely. And that's the problem with this movie. It had to be set in the era in which it was written. You would think it would be child's play, but nooo. I would have elaborated, but bmacv's comment explains it quite well. I'll limit my comment to Rachel Ward. It looks like he ate his ass completely out of existence for this role. As a result, it looks like a crack at chemotherapy, and is as sexy as a trailing gay leather sofa. I found it "I could die at any moment" it seems rather baffling, and this strongly penalized its supposed "hotness" and the "sexual tension" that the film intended to create. Apart from that, the film was pretty good; a 7+ out of 10.
