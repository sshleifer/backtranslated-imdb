Some spoilers If you are a big fan of horror movies, then you will know that Halloween has paved the way for many slasher movies. Often imitated, never duplicated, this film is a true classic horror and is certainly one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the most terrifying. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this, it's just how it worked. But I should say that this blows all the others away. It's really scary, and seeing Michael come out from behind a bush or walk in the dark sends a shiver down my spine. My favorite part of the film was when Michael stabbed a boy and tilted his head to one side. It is one of the strangest images in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The subsequent cuts, like the Friday 13 film, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he's realistic, you can imagine a crazy guy like him going around killing people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is that it is not based on blood or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It is a pity that the subsequent films of the series have fluctuated from this, because this is as good as an example of a spectacular slasher film as they come.
