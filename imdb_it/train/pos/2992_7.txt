It seems that even the director does not like this film, but for me I think he is a little hard on himself. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to keep you interested in everything. <br /> <br /> It is shot in what appears to be a nice village that also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies shot in England, try it. <br /> <br /> I have just seen a trailer for the last film of the directors, "The Devil's Chair", which seems quite surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not enough English horror film for me, so everyone who arrives deserves our attention, and this is not as bad as one might think
