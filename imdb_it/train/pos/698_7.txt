I saw this movie a little while ago, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, even though it had its positive points, which for me was the "Wtf?" Of Donnie Darko? factor after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the positive come the negative points. For me, the girl in the movie was incredibly good and Dominic Monaghan also did a good job. Unfortunately I don't have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This could just be me, and I'm not claiming to be a serious critic, the way I don't find myself quite skilled, but it didn't seem convincing as an actor. But maybe it's even more surprising, because even if I'm not a critic, this catches my attention. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I think it's definitely a movie that is worth watching. It's interesting, confusing and you should have seen it.
