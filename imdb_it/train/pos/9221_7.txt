Once again, I was looking through the discount bid video and took this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time the movies I find in the trash are pure shit (I mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time turns out to be surprisingly good. This film is much better than I expected. I found it very engaging, even though it was obviously made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> Directing is nothing special, but the plot is intriguing with some beautiful chills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I wasn't too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this film is surprisingly good-natured. There is no bloody violence, no vulgarity, no nudity, no sex. Usually, these films require all four of these elements. The vow of PG is well deserved - not as "Sixteen Candles" where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short free nude scene. <br /> <br /> I only wish the love story between Corey Haim and his love interest could have been developed more. The film tends to be heavy due to the texture, and potentially good secondary textures are set aside. Instead of developing a chemistry between them, we end up observing a neglected three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing in the end, but there is so little chemistry that seems forced. <br /> <br /> "The Dream Machine" is not a jewel, but it is good and clean entertainment. It's quite forgettable, especially with a cast of strangers, except Haim, but it's also much better than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
