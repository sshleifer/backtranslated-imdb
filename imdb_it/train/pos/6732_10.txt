This was the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and happy to find that this was also one of her films. Great job Stacy! Last week I was starting to work again, bored O * and ^% less and this movie was released. Growing up in Orange County in the 80's I sailed up and down the local beaches and so did my father when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I surfed the body, boogeyboarded and then I moved from there. This film fascinated me. It was a lot earlier than my time, but it was great to see what these guys went through .. FOR PIONEERS! This film is a collector's item.
