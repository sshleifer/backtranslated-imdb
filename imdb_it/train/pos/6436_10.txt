Ingrid Bergman is a Polish countess temporarily impoverished in the Paris of 1900 who finds herself chased by the most popular general in France and a glamorous count - and who is besides being engaged to a shoe magnate. This is the error-proof premise that drags one of the most delirious plots in the history of cinema. There are political machinations behind the scenes from the general's conductors, a downed balloonist and an exciting Bastille Day crowd, but the heart of this wonderfully photographed film is the upstairs / downstairs intrigues involving rude servants and aristocrats only slightly more sober. Yes, it is the game of the rules of the game. Before it is all over, even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper of the Rules, makes his appearance - like a gypsy leader, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast towards the end, causing some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the hell - Elena and her men is another deeply human Renoir masterpiece.
