This film is by far the cutest I've ever seen in a long time! Wonderful animations and lovely characters (even the bad guys were cute!) They made this an absolute winner in my book, and also in the books of those with whom I saw it. I still want to see him again, but I didn't have time. Better than Toy Story, which was fine, but not so good.
