It is not easy to make a film with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors have accepted the challenge, not all of them are good, some even boring. But in his entity, "Paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that, as "Love Actually" says, "love is all around", especially in the city of love. Here is a resume (I will try to make it as free from spoilers as possible) of the 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE: a kind of boring opening sequence, nothing really special. A man finds a parking lot and sees many disparate couples pass by, wondering why he can't find a girl. And then, suddenly, a woman faints next to her car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - another boring sequence, about three teenagers looking for a "piece of ass", when suddenly a Muslim girl travels right in front of them, receiving the help of one of the boys. Really basic, but with a very sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - this was a huge disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with an artistic background could be interesting for the great Van Sant. In the end, everything that comes AFTER Ulliel's monologue is good, everything before is simply boring. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - a fun sequence of the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying a word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is simply hilarious. This kept me hooked to the end, and that also makes you really attracted to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - also a good story, even if the performance is poor, the heart is there. It is the story of a Hispanic woman who drops her son early in the morning to take care of another child in the suburbs. Gorgeous. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY: this segment must be the strangest and most bizarre of the entire film. A kind of shampoo seller comes to a place similar to Chinatown in Paris. If I understand correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE: a truly wonderful sequence. A man meets with his wife in a restaurant, to break up with her, so that he can escape with his lover. But his wife has devastating news. Simple enough, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - also a sad sequence. Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother. One night, he wakes up feeling his dead baby. When he arrives at the scene, a cowboy tells her he can say goodbye to his son. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall in love could have been great, but, even if it has some good movie tricks, the story is not intriguing and it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a true original and great sequence, one of the best in the film! A young woman and an older man discuss their future and their fear for a certain man ... Cuaron does a great job of directing and the actors are fantastic! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - an American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her dealer. again a nice segment, with a very sad ending PLACE DES FETES - a woman who comes from a homeless person, starts talking to her in a romantic way ... because it's the love of her life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very unformal and not romantic, Pigalle is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing a certain diversity to the film, QdlM is a relief. A young man (Wood) finds a vampire who kills a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strangely romantic, Madeleine is superb. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another disappointing segment. Directed by Wes Craven and with stars like Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is just ordinary, not original at all. <br /> <br /> SAUBENNE SAINT-DENIS - the voices are TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, beautiful and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning) that she breaks up with him. Reflects on their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment was co-directed by Depardieu and has stars like Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also disappointing. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry among the actors. <br /> <br /> 14th ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is exhilarating and sad at the same time. An American tells of his trip to Paris in his French lesson. His French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, he realizes that Paris is much more than it looks. <br /> <br /> With Feist in the background, "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, not disappointing at all, even if some segments bored me, the size of the film is fantastic! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
