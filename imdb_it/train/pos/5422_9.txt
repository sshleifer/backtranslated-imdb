The story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film "Gunga Din". Based on the poem Rudyard Kipling, the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and starring Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The main role is played by Sam Jaffe, well known in my era as the head of Ben Casey, Dr. Zorba, a name that has become synonymous with large and out of control hair. Say "Dr. Zorba hair" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> Set in India at the time of the British occupation, three soldiers: two lively and romantic figures in Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a big crampon - they are cut-ups - actually, three guys too grown. Gunga Din is the water carrier, treated in a rather petty way - verbally, anyway - by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) is fond of him. When he captures Din (pronounced Deen) while practicing his soldier as he walks and greets while mimicking the unit during maneuvers, Cutter gives him some hints. <br /> <br /> The cheerful band of musketeers will break when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that he is going to marry a beautiful girl (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter cross Thugees, a killer cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and Ballantine insists on reintegrating to save Cutter. After all, it's a friendly film. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" begins with carefree, with slapstick and a wide and wonderful comedy, in particular of Cary Grant, which is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so beautiful, it's hard to decide which to look at first. Much of the film is made up of huge action sequences that are very exciting. In the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense and electrifying battle. <br /> <br /> Grant has the most ostentatious role, Fairbanks is the romantic lover, and McLaglen as McChesney, mainly for his treatment of Gunga Din, is the most unlikely character, even if his tender heart is identified in his love for his elephant Annie. Its softness reaches the end of the film, in particular in the moving final tear-down scene. <br /> <br /> Always a kind and sympathetic actor, Sam Jaffe offers a beautiful performance as Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and high dreams. Without many dialogues, Jaffe transmits the soul of Gunga Din in a magnificent way. <br /> <br /> This is truly the ultimate adventure film, of great significance, with good acting scenes, a wonderful soundtrack and some beautiful cinematic images. Another from that extraordinary year, 1939. Highly recommended.
