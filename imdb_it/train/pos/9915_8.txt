I had no place to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I probably would have missed this movie if I hadn't chosen Air Canada. Seen on a small screen at the back of the seat opposite, I found this fascinating and fascinating. I drifted in a couple of places and had to jump back but I had to watch until the end. Now I can't wait for the DVD to arrive in Europe, although I will be equally amazed when I can go out the door, it's still waiting to be discovered! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is extraordinary and the film offers so much information and "fills" the story told by the photos. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time available).
