The best treasure island ever built. They simply don't make films like this, or ever. No one makes movies like this. More <br /> <br /> of a novelty, this film is fun, frank and charming, but moody, mysterious and dark. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite images. The director <br /> <br /> must have had an idea of ​​what it is, but surely leaves room for your impressions and interpretations, leaving little room for imagination. Because he hasn't made films like this anymore, I have no idea. While <br /> <br /> reminds me of some of the best noir, it's one of a kind. But this <br /> <br /> is not for the lazy or simple.
