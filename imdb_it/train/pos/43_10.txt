I really enjoyed this movie. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends for such a tragedy. Alicia was just a tormented soul and Deanna was so happy to see someone after being hit. My only complaint was that it was a little slow at first and it took a while to get to the bottom of things. Apart from that it was fantastic.
