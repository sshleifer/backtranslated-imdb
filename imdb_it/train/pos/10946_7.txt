Not to listen to critics who are probably the still bitter roasting players that Silverman infamously gave Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago, "The Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, ridiculous and would rather fit well in a line-up of Adult Swim. If Silverman attenuates the "doody" youthful jokes and emphasizes the darkest and meanest submissive that the show has suggested so far, we could have one of the greatest cult comedies from the announced "Strangers With Candy". But just looking at the pilot, it's just a solid dark comedy / musical, not exceptional, but with enormous potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman created a hilarious woman-child of a character - a prettier, younger, Jewish and American version of Princess Jerri Blank and the show features one of the unconventional, non-stereotypical portraits of a couple gay I've ever seen on television. The first reviews suggest that the next couple of episodes will overtake the pilot so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds.
