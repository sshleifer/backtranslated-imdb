The Enterprise pilot has one thing missing from the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic and imperfect personalities. The Utopian characters of the Next Generation got tired, they were so noble as to be incredible. I also like the secondary plot that humans are bitter towards Vulcans. It's fun to see them as conceited snobs. I can't wait to see when humans become the dominant race between the two, although I don't think it would work during the show. The only negative aspects that jumped on me were the feeling of "fast closing the 2-hour end" of the end, which is common to many of Trek's shows. The second was the shameless digging for evaluations of a couple of senselessly sexy scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to cover the pre-teen audience with a little bit of skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode works.
