Father of the Pride has been the best new television show since Family Guy was born. It was yet another masterpiece of talented people from Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, the show revolves around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable supporting characters including Roger the surly orangutan, Vincent the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the fake patriots Snout Brothers and Chutney the elephant. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a great way, making fun the most trivial activities. The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialogues and controversial topics (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the program's brilliance. <br /> <br /> The blame for the failure of this show lies in NBC. They chose to transmit the episodes in a non-particular order (perhaps influenced by which guest stars could promote) rather than the more logical production order. Several times, the show has been preset for half an hour more than this disgrace as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes were not enough)! It is indeed a bad omen for the future of television as an art if an original and daring show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to get a wider following. 10/10
