A best-selling book on honor killings in Jordan is withdrawn by its publishers after the allegations show that the story was invented; associated with other accusations of its author's past as a woman-with-woman. A few years later, he resurfaces, conceding that he has taken a certain amount of dramatic license but is willing to work with a director to demonstrate the substance of his accusations. What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, someone who has meaningless behavior unless what he is saying is true, yet he seems unable to say something that is not extraordinarily dramatic, but not shown at best and more often, verifiable false. It is almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri was hoping to achieve by appearing in this film: claim? celebrity? - all it gets is to project a certain image of itself as a deeply damaged individual, and even this cannot be taken for face value. The director Anna Broinowski appears more and more in focus as her film advances, and more and more exasperated to start; but in the end he is rewarded with an interesting story, even if frightening and disturbing, and one of those films that reminds us that the world we live in is really strange.
