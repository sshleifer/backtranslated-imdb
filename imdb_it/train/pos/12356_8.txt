Unlike some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oirans (prostitutes) who live outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of women from the Tokugawa era. I can't say that the stories were particularly illuminating, but their charm lies in the way they are typical. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the art direction and acting. I seemed to see a time and a place that I could never otherwise see. The actors, in particular the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. I would recommend this film only to people who want to taste Japanese culture or to those who love quiet and exciting stories. It's a great example of both.
