I just saw "The last wave" in my school's fine arts library. It's intriguing, like all Peter Weir things, but it's not always an attention that I wanted. I found myself fascinated by the ideas that were thrown at me (because they are very well managed by the director of the film Weir) but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I got a little bored in spots. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds an Australian lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams that he has that connect him to an Aborigone group that he is defending. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense meteorological sequence and has really fantastic sound effects in everything (in particular the bizarre, "sounding" of sound design) and a strong direction; but he never entertained me like Weir's later films do. I might just need to watch it again though. <br /> <br /> Good movie about obsession and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery that exists between whites and Aborigines offers some very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless Peter Weir, though. For him only this film deserves to be seen ... a very organic director. As an Australian response Malick! I would give a 7 because he has enough big ideas to overcome his boring moments.
