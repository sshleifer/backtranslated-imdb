This is a very fun movie, easy to watch, that entertains you almost all the time. The director's work is recognizable and the kind of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical story of a police partner like a lethal weapon, but the jokes and the comedy are of the Argentine type. The twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and has to go with Detective Diaz (played by Luque) in his homework while assisting him (Diaz is upset because his wife cheats on him). Some dialogues are hilarious around the world: understandable and ridiculous everywhere. It is very good overall, it would have deserved an 8, but I voted 7 because it lowers a bit at the end. On a personal observation I must add that he is a "good" for Argentine filmmakers, considering that the small good is coming recently.
