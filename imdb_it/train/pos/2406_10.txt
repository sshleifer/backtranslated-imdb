this is the best demonstration of what I think was really Jesus. most of the films show Jesus as effeminate, lobotomized or tortured. this Jesus laughed, played and was serious when necessary. this is the kind of people who might be attracted to Jesus, not the usually Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> the film took some liberties, trying to "fill in the blanks". but the fillers did not seem impossible, or even improbable. one thing I could object to is that he never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film portrayed that the Romans were the main engine of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea) <br /> <br /> it seemed that the film had been studied well. an example is the casual comment on a teenager who has been called a "brand". it is believed that the mark (or sign of john) was the boy referred to in the garden of gethsemane whose mantle had been taken off and ran away naked (Mark 14:51). I have the feeling that they have tried to make the film as precise as possible (even in the spirit).
