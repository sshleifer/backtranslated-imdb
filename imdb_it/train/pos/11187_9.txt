Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage and a daughter, Ellen. They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89 years old and could basically talk to you about Ludlow's whole story. <br /> <br /> Behind Creed's new home, there is a path that leads to a pet cemetery (pet seminar). When Ellen wants to go and see him, Jud voluntarily takes the family on a journey. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the children left, Ellen's cat church dies. Jud feels that Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat, so she suggests Louis follow him along the path, past the animal cemetery. <br /> <br /> Jud tells Louis about this cemetery, once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries the Church without Jud's help. A couple of days later, the Church returns, alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This film was one of two horror films that could really scare me apart from "The Exorcist". The biggest interpretation would have been Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the Creed make the mistake of bringing things back from the dead. <br /> <br /> The music in this film plays an extravagant part. It is both sad and mysterious. It goes very well with the film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
