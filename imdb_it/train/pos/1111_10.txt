This is not "so bad that it is good", it is purely good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of a four-year-old child (in response to a certain comment ...) However, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of himself, a parody of you and a parody of me . It is the single most brilliant text in the history of cinema. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It represents the recognition of the absurd and undermines all that I or you call standard. I write screenplays and this film alone has opened up for me a genre of comedy, something like this we've never seen before. It can only be taken in portions ... its kind of exploitation ... now I'm just trying to take the minimum of ten lines. My comment ended some time ago. I hope it works when I send it now.
