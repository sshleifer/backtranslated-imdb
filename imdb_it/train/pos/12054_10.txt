I saw this film for the first time here in the UK in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it. I still have the videocassette, even if worn out (over the years many friends and family have borrowed it and they have also been cooled!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming home that night, grabbing a Christmas drink, turning off the lights and looking at what was advertised as a "Christmas Ghost Story". Even now I remember certain scenes that still send my hair up to my neck ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments on the film that say this is not this and not that ... I think those people get scared on Friday 13 and the like, stem and slash, which are ridiculous. This is a "traditional" ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects ... no swearing, no blood, free sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etc. So, how refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like the chilling, well-written, well-acted horror with a really scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; only last night I saw the original Haunting and this is a superb film. Very new atmospheric - and so is The Woman In Black. The end of the film is different from the book, but still very good. I advise. Try it ... you will like it * if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, light the fire, close the doors, have a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
