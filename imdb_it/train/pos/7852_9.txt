The curiosity of Ladislas Starewicz with insects and cinema merges into a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. The rather simple history of a pair of adulterous beetles that both seek stimulation outside of their marriage is similar to a Biograph or Vitagraph in less than time. Starewicz's turning point in history is to use embalmed beetles with wires that straighten the legs in frame-by-frame animation. The story develops as Mr. Beetle is unknowingly captured by the camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle returns home to find his wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he pursues her with anger, but eventually forgives her and takes her out to watch a movie. However, Ms. Beetle soon learns her husband's infidelities, since the film they watch is the footage of Mr. Beetle's jealousy and the dragonfly together. Mrs. Beetle breaks through Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps across the screen, and they both end up in prison after the projector they destroyed ignites. Insects are placed in humanized environments such as a house or a nightclub, and are given human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insect characters carry briefcases, drive cars and even wear shoes, but they also shake their antennas and open and close their jaws like real insects would. The novelty of the story does not end, even after multiple visions, but no matter how fluid the movements are, the film moves slowly. The action takes place with complex details, but in the process the speed and a faster pace of the shooting are lost. Despite its rhythm, the film is an excellent example of the first Starewicz puppet and is highly recommended.
