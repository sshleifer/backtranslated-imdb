I saw the DVD of this film which also has an excellent commentary track (in English). It seems in Cambodia (English subtitles say the character is speaking in Thai but the film says Cambodia) a very violent evil man is raising children to kill using hunger and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and a policeman's mate is killed during the killings. The policeman Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a policeman who was hit and is in a coma. Wai's boss is his father's friend and is worried about Wai's unpredictable behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who captured his father in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a shabby dump hut where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating that her father won't let her go (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand her but saves her from her father who seems to have sex with her maybe that's the reason for Cat III). Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to her home where they are married and she becomes pregnant, Wai follows and joins the wicked (who is training the boys) to make a deal to fight and train so they can get Pang . There is a great showdown between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman the main victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang who cut off her son from the dead mother just to die and leave him as the possible next guy to be raised as a murderer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. The woman with a long nail pulled out of her foot. Neck and trunk knives. The guns fired directly at the head. And several very intense blows. Maybe it's sad and intense, but it's certainly worth seeing.
