This is a great movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke going out in the public eye and telling her story is a source of inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for you as a person. The only thing I don't like is that I can't do it on tape, I tried to look for it but without success. Does anyone know how to get it?
