The events of 11 September 2001 need no further human interest in the form of following the formation of the young fireman or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion it would have been better to let it go. I think the directors tried too hard, maybe they thought that the events of the day needed a story as a background. The comment of one of the policemen - "this is not fucked at Disneyworld" is apt. <br /> <br /> However, it is a compelling vision for the representation of events. The film producers were in the right places at the right time, no other footage of the day matches what they shot.
