This film is one of the very few Indian films, which would never fade with the passage of time, nor would it diminish its binding charm, even if Indian cinema turns into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill-oriented extras take to improve the PT style movie songs. <br /> <br /> Cinematography speaks of Josef Werching's excellent abilities which accentuate the film's monumental and cinematographic scope in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Gone are the days of great cinema, when every scene had to be cropped many times and shot again before finalizing it, while careful attention was paid to the creation and modification of the scenes. Some of his touching scenes are full of sublime emotional intensity, as in the case where Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an endorsement for Nikah (Marriage Bond) and climbs down the hill as she runs in a traumatized frenzy. At the moment, Raj Kumar follows her, and a strong wind blows away the veil of Kumari and on Kumar's legs ........ <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi will always be remembered with words of gold in the annals of the history of Indian cinema for having attempted to complete this film in a record set 12 years old. He had to handle the filming of some of the vital songs without Meena's close-up, because Meena Kumari, the woman in the lead role, was terminally ill and struggling for her life in early 1971.
