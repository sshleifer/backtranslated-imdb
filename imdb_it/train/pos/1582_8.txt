Another small fragment of the huge puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama on the protest of Rosenstrasse in Berlin, an event I had never heard of, started at the end of February 1943. Details are given in an addendum following this review. <br /> <br /> The film's narrative defines the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in New York, in the present. Here a wealthy and non-observant Jewish woman, whose husband has just died, affects her children and others by supporting an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. He goes even further, asking for his daughter's non-Jewish boyfriend to leave the house. <br /> <br /> The distressed daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader), learns for the first time from a larger cousin that during the Second World War her mother, then 8 years old, had been welcomed and protected in Berlin from an Aryan woman. Hannah leaves everything, goes to Berlin and finds this woman, Lena Fischer, who is now 90 years old. Hanna easily convinces the woman to tell her story. It all seems a little too good. <br /> <br /> The film subsequently improves, focusing through long flashbacks mainly on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest, in which the central fictional character is the same Mrs. Fischer at 33 (played beautifully by Katja Riemann), established baroness and pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a violinist from a Jewish concert, one of the men detained on the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> Narrative is briefly intertwined from time to time back to the present and also ends in New York City. While the scenes of the present are saturated with colors, the scenes of 1943 are faded, strong in shades of blue-gray. <br /> <br /> The quality of the acting is generally quite good, what we might expect given the deep talent pool in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most important female director of the New German Cinema, herself ex actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is simply told. What is missing is a feature that would have helped: firm text notes at the end that indicated the final result for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse, a result that was, as the addendum below clarifies, incredibly positive. <br /> <Br /> "Rosenstrasse" did not go well with the opinions of most film critics. Long too, unnecessarily stratified, supplier of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: so go to the usual rap. It's too long. But I found in this film an austere, powerful, spontaneous and completely convincing protest voice from the women who held the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I didn't find anything flashy, contemporary or manipulative in this representation. The absence of extreme violence (no one is struck or otherwise brutally physical) has intensified my tension, which has increased incrementally as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some vicious attacks to start at any moment. The gloom of the film remained with me later. I often woke up later the night I saw the film, my mind full of dark, melancholy and chaotic images, feelings and feelings evoked by the film. For me, this rarely happens. (In German and English). My vote: 8/10 (B +). (Seen 05/31/05).

But before the deportation of the prisoners took place, in this case, the wives and other relatives became aware of what was happening and appeared at the address of Rosenstrasse, first in one and two, and then in an ever increasing number. <br /> <br /> Perhaps six thousand have participated in the protest, although not all at the same time. Women asked for their husbands back, day after day, for a week. Unarmed, disorganized and without leaders, they faced the most brutal forces available to the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, anxious to have that city in a purified racial way, was also responsible for the nation's public morale. In both cases he was worried about the possible repercussions of women's actions. Rather than inviting a more open disagreement by shooting women in the streets and fearing to jeopardize the "Final Solution", Goebbels with the help of Hitler released the prisoners of Rosenstrasse and even ordered the return of twenty-five who had already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all those freed from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women have won an incredible victory over the forces of destruction.
