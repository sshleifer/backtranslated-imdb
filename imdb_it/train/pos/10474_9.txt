I was incredibly impressed by this movie. It contained fundamental elements of depression, pain, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just a genius musician who hit the bottom, but it was a man who was gripped by the pain that drastically tried to find comfort in his music. Find a companion who comes with his problems. Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but above all a conclusion to the events that had shaped their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character according to today's standards of a rock star. Yet he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that made him stagnant, while things around him literally end up in ruins. His goal is to create his Whale music, in fact it becomes an obsession for him. Claire is the little girl who needs a place to stay. Find hidden talents while in the Des company He also finds a mutual friend who accepts it. Learn to trust him for a period of time. <br /> <br /> These two find love with one another. It is not the mind that blows, the kind of passion infused by sex, but a love in which friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have been injured, they find trust together.
