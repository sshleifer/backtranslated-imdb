I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a child and was happy to see a film about the book. <br /> <br /> I was a little boy sitting for a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8, and I had to talk to the girl to watch the movie. But happily, in the end, she was happy to see it and also said she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br /> There were some moments of great laughter and the film was not as "coarse" as I expected it to be ... even though it was really up to the gross-o-meter ... < br /> <br /> The only thing I can't understand is why they had to have the "dilly" line in there that was made by Woody in reference to his private part ... which for me was the only shocking moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience startle audibly at that moment in the film) ... I have no idea why it was included in the film; it didn't add anything to the real movie except for that shock / gasp factor ... apart from that, a pretty good movie. Nice to see the all-grown "Pepsi" girl.
