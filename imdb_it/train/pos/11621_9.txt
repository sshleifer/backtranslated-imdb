I was bored one night and Red Eye was active and I thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best films in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just entered the movie it was so brilliant. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two great protagonists in the film with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply brilliant and gives you the feeling for the people in the film. <br /> <br /> The music is simply excellent, it gives you the chills and can even make me feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I like the way the film was so well done and it never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like Red Eyes so much that I can watch them over and over again. <br /> <br /> If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
