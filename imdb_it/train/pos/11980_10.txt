Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and is also a good show for families. There are no more shows like this. The children are very nice and even if it's a bit rough, it's still good, especially for those who saw it as a child. I'd like to see the cast interviewed now. Anyone who would like to see the cast interviews, rather like a where they are now typing what for the special features of the DVD, should go to the Petition spot website and sign a petition entitled Full House Reunion on DVD as there is a petition for this in the hope that the cast will want to do it. Yay for Full House!
