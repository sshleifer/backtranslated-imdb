Paperhouse is the touching and moving film I've ever seen. Often considered a "horror film" this, I believe, is a serious mistake. A few days ago he called him "the nightmare of the person who thinks on Elm Street" and while I accept the logic of his conclusions I cannot help but think that it is a badly deserved and misleading label. Those who can only see horror are really missing here and only serve to show that they really aren't thinking at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just trying to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Quite simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than I once said, "the film hits you on a completely emotional level", which could somehow explain why my comments are so relentless. To be honest, I don't make excuses for this, so if you feel that my words are too sweet for your tastes, stop reading now because there are others to come. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find a film that has its heart is the pain and anguish of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile moment of our life. Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their role with the sensitivity and intelligence necessary to make everything work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a transparent and convincing way. <br /> <br /> Yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have escaped the grasp of the studios and somehow faded. <br /> <br /> Add to all this a very talented director (Bernard Rose), an imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and bewitching soundtrack you can ever hear and you could start to understand why I have this affection and affinity for this film no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
