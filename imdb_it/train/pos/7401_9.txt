I found it very interesting that the film managed to bridge the gap between my American culture and that of the authors, namely Chinese. It becomes a story about values ​​and makes the observer re-evaluate their choices in life and loyalty to institutions. Surprisingly, he managed to do it in a gentle, slightly humorous way, which only in retrospect observes threatening his status quo. I liked the movie and would look at it again if I could.
