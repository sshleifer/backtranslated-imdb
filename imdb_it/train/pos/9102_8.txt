I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa film festival, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Watching it on a big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of those TV screens that most cinemas have) with an excellent sound system always improves the cinematic experience, since the film takes over the eyes and ears and sucks you in in history, in the image. <br /> <br /> The film features a series of characters, which are freely interconnected. Their stories intersect at certain points, and the multiplicity of narrative lines reminded me a lot of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the real hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which provides the backdrop for the entire film. It houses the characters, contains the sidewalks and the streets on which they walk, and sets the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. <br /> <br /> The film returns again and again to certain themes (shoes for example), and in essence Salazar makes his metaphors more and more understandable to the spectator as the film proceeds. Combine the views of the city with the shots of the characters and elegantly match the feeling of the scene to the background. A series of talented actors helps him portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time. It might not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is very positive, and consequently the film is light and fun sometimes. The music along the film is usually pop, with some instrumental pieces (I hope I can put my hand on the soundtrack one day, although I seriously doubt that I will do it). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out this film has a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you'll have to believe me on word). For this and more I give this film a solid 8/10.
