I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she's wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. It is delightful to look like the lively and amiable author who suffered a terrible loss when his niece died in a drowning accident. He blames his niece's husband, his nephew. He plans to kill him to avenge his death since the police abandoned her. I would have loved someone else besides Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never really like Hartley in something personal. And of course with Columbo, there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica in a belly dance lesson. Ruth's Abigail is an intelligent investigator and combines intelligence with Columbo always beautifully interpreted by Peter Falk.
