Obviously I should give this movie 10 out of 10 because my uncle was the main writer of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego has written scripts for over 50 years of life in Italy. He was a great storyteller and someone suggested putting his stories into writing. This is what Rodolfo Sonego did. If you take a look at his biography, you can see the number of films that have been made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who acted in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to check out the locations of "A Girl in Australia" and created a great movie about a proxy bride after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. Recently I found a copy of this movie on DVD. GREAT
