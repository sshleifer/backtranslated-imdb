The daughter's words are poems: "I can't go in another year, I have to go to a hotel room". "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble faun is moving ... he just gave us a washing machine, this is the deal." "I'm pulverized by this last thing." "... raccoons and cats get a little boring for too long." "... I'd like this little mouse nest, mouse hole." And there is wisdom in the words of the mother: "... yes, the pleasure is all mine." "This little book will keep me straight, straight as a dye." "Always do everything correctly." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I have to have professional music." "I'm your mother, do you remember me?" The mother / daughter relationship is designed in this magnificent film. This is a film for Mother's Day.
