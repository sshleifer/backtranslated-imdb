The greatest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a total newbie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the clue! This is a PRIVATE plot, built as a private enterprise. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: an intelligent "director" with some money. Everything can be done only by proxy. The "manager" must only be a trigger. If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the film's explicit sequences, a real storyline has less chance of being discovered. All the actors' performances are well done, with some special mentions for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
