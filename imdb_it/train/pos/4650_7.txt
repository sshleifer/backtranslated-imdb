As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the beautiful Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flying scenes in this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 pod jammer, in this case an inert missile Rb 75 (Maverick) painted black with the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. The real pod jammer doesn't look like that, at least not the ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's a fun movie with a very funny ending (the last minute). Anyone interested in seeing various Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, should see it. <br /> <br />
