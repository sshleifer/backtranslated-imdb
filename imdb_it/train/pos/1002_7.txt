Only two comments ... SEVEN after many years? Hardly proof of the inexorable traction force of the film! As mentioned, the low budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. Having said that, however, it is not without value - both as entertainment and as a fright in itself. <br /> <br /> True, the most essential plot is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. Plus a case of intrigue! Gibney could have made a more noteworthy impression had he played Halifax - investigating a couple of apparently unrelated murders as the main suspect. The script is better than the average and the overall production of a high standard. He cannot involve the viewer in particular at key moments. <br /> <br /> After collecting the DVD for only $ 3.95 last week in my regular video store, I can't regret the expenses. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. Don't expect fireworks!
