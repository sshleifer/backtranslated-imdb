Parker and Stone transplant their crazy insane humor from their animated masterpiece to a live action feature with generally good results. Much of the film is played by Trey and Matt with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average boys invent a new sport, a mix of drive-over basketball with baseball score that becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sports movie clich√©s and send them, along with any other piece of popular culture that comes into their sight. It works like an episode of South Park, with the usual dialogue with machine guns, humor and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this film has a weak point it is the association with the team that gave us "Airplane" and the "Naked Gun" series. This influence is clearly visible with the massive use of visual gags and the presence of a rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn is a little better at playing the corporate b ** tard which was his party piece since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine go up in smoke as only he can, but it must be admitted that he is perfect for the role of crazy team owner. /> <br /> For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more at ease as aspiring comics rock stars. This is manifested in the pre-eminence given to the soundtrack in almost everything they create. As usual, they offer a good selection here including the mandatory track of their ultra-non-PC DVDA vehicle. <br /> <br /> A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves a sort of prize for enduring difficult task of interpreting Stan to Parker and the rampant couple of Cartmans. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a fun comedy that is held back by its full potential by relying too much on the "Naked Gun / Airplane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something really brilliant (or absolutely terrible) if they have full control over a future film. America, block these guys or put them in command.
