This documentary explores a story taken from Pilger's latest book "Freedom Next Time", published in 2006, which reveals the shocking expulsion of Diego Garcia's natives, one of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> The islanders are technically British citizens, given that Diego Garcia is a British colony, very similar to Mauritius, the island near where the natives were usually exiled. But the British government ignored their requests to return home, as the island is now a military base of the US army, which used it as a base for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's cover is shocking, especially when documenting the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His well-rounded interviews are excellent, and his hoarding of a representative of Parliament in which he uses the government's information to nail him down, ranks as one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that completely illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The plot of this video with interviews, and the music of the islanders, really increases the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "Stealing a Nation" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.
