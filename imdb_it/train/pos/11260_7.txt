Well, the story is a little difficult to follow for the first time, but this is only because of all the vampires / witches fan-shaped in the 70s dancing on the bongo drum. This naturally interrupted by some vampiric orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. And for girl-to-girl action, vampiric or not ... this movie is just a jump !!!
