As usual, Hollywood has stereotyped EVERYONE in the film. But, this is a classic - from the white banker aimed at the Russian woman !! Very well. Even the facial expressions were fantastic! The language was perfect (even in Russian) and Nicole did a great job !! Hi guys - you get what you pay for :)
