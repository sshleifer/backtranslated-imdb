Red Eye, a film that id wanted to see for a while ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner (Jack the Ripper) a managerial pose for the Assassins, and his literally murderous plan to defeat a highly profiled man and his family. /> <br /> An everyday woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, she goes to work, at home ... worries ... hates flying. <br /> <br /> The death of his grandmother sends her on a flight that has delayed several times. <br /> <br /> a flight in which she meets Jack ... an apparent ordinary type, until she sumptuously reveals her profession and her plans, which coincidentally include her in them, she is the key to the death of Keefe (sp?). <br /> <br /> She manages to save them ... but almost the cost of her life is taken, Jack is defeated ... the Keef are saved ... oh what a story * laughs * I'm joking, the movie is really good actually, the best of last year ... there are little things you have to pay attention to earlier in the film that have a great importance for the film later. .. (Frankenstein's pen) I w did it several times before taking all the jokes and quirks ... <br /> <br /> not to be missed for thriller lovers, but there is a slight suggestion (the bathroom scene) (jack) "Thanks for the quicky" and the (female assistant) "Ohhh ... it will be one of those flights" (second female assistant) "Hey! this is not a motel" you are the idea ...
