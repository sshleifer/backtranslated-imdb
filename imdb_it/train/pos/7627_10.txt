I remember watching this movie a while ago and after seeing 3,000 miles to Graceland, everything was flooded again. Why hasn't this version of video or DVD yet? It is sacrilegious that this majesty of cinema has never been released while other rejections have been. In reality this is the John Carpenter film that has not been published. In fact, I haven't seen it on TV since the day I saw it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role for which he was born. John Carpenter's breakdown of horror brought this gem that I would like the TV to sound again. It is well acted and well executed in terms of singing. Enthusiastically exposing most of Elvis's greatest successes. I think this was also the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter that prompted them to make numerous great films (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big trouble in little china, and Fuga da Los Angeles. Someone has to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life, which I feel will not only damage the king but also ruin the magic that he has.If this is not released, we will be in the Heartbreak hotel.
