I agree with what "broken vein" he wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling that comes at the end of this film. I absolutely loved the locations they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sound track on which Hans Matheson sings. It is funny. Nighy was fabulous in his role, Nail "nailed" him, Beano was the typical drummer and Rea held him together. Bruce Robinson was fantastic. Helena was a lovely girl. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was wonderful. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was perfect! Too bad that not many other musicians have checked this movie! They should! I told all my musician friends. great quote from Jimmy Nail's character: "It should be rock & roll, not Phantom of the f ***** g opera!"
