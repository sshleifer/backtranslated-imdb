The only reason I didn't give this 10 stars was the DVD format: no menus, extras, etc. However, if you've ever had a dream of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and in your dreams, don't let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most affirmative films I've ever seen. It's magic. The acting is superb, the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those films about which we talked about "cult". I have recommended this film to all my friends. Some love it, others can't finish it. Whenever I think, or feel, that something is impossible, I think of the role of Alan Arkin in this film. Of course, I would like to make other films.
