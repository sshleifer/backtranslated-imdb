(contains slight spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey of "It's a Wonderful Life" by Frank Capra, so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life", Bailey can see the world as it would have been if he had never been born. In "The Far Country", Jeff Webster by Stewart, not being involved to help someone else (except himself), can see essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) does not exist. /> <br /> Not involved (and trying not to worry about anyone), Webster is forced to see those he can't help but worry about hurting himself, pushing around and even killing while he stands and does nothing. This reminds the viewer of George Bailey of the vision of a world that has turned upside down because he has also decided not to get involved since he was never born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same image - a close-up of a bell. Stewart, revolving around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it seems, earned his "wings".
