I was thrilled when I first saw it in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko moved on to the middle of the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom was not forgotten. I didn't do it when I arrived in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story of friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and listened to the audience in a dance recital in Natal singing Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair was at its ends. There is much to learn from this story for all peoples.
