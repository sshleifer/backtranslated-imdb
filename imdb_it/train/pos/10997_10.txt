WOW. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen ALWAYS. Absolutely in love! Before the initial credits were completed, I was glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a science fiction thriller - And the edge of your Whodunnit seat. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I wish it would never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a character to throw away. Anyone could have played it. The main actor, Jeremy Northram, was the perfect genius boy. <br /> <br /> I like this movie for those who loved War Games, Sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
