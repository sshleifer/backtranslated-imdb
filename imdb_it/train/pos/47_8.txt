It breaks my heart that this film is not appreciated as it should be. it is very undervalued. people have forgotten what the movies are about, nowadays they only think of bum bum movies, which can be a lot of fun to watch with popcorn and friends, like transformers, oriented movies, with a super mega budget like 300m or even taller, with special effects only and what are stupid movies without plot. It's the kind of a film that I, despite everything. Of course it is fun to watch CGI very successful, but we don't get anything essential from that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think the performance was excellent. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) has made this film an Oscar value. Busy Philipps' emotional performance was amazing, it's a shame we won't see Oscar in his hands, which he deserves.
