I remember seeing him when I was seven or eight. I must have found the characters around, because they left an impression in my mind that it lasted long after the film ended. And the ending, now it's sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I have had the opportunity to review this film lately, and I discovered that the plot was too simple, character, two-dimensional ... I guess it's the kind of film you can only with the innocence of a small child ... Too bad ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this for all you parents with young children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can't tell you if the translation is good or less).
