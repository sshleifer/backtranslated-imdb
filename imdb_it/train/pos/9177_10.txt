I must say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but none is comparable to this one. The best for me. I could never imagine anyone else ever playing these characters again. The last time I saw it was in 1984 when I was only 13 years old. At that time I was a bookworm and had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not losing any of the episodes. I'd like to see it again because it's so beautiful. :-)
