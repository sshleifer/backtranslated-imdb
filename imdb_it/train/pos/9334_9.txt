The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy that featured Ursula Andress's only Bond girl. The man was hot in this movie .. It was stacked and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula smoked a lot in this film. I've never seen the nurse's outfit that she filled out before. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Andress plays a nurse who is hired to take care of a wealthy senior. Even one at home seems to be beating his boots. One night, the nurse decides to take the temperature of her nephew and give some T.L.C. to his old client. The old man brings his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. What kind of work did you entrust to your family? Will the geezer fall for his car donor? How can you deal with the eighty-year-old and the rest of the family? To find out it is necessary to find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian but badly dubbed in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
