Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited for a success. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero becomes more entangled the more he tries to extricate himself. And the small American city no longer seems so sure of the big city. Like its predecessor above, this film has a lot of twists that seem unlikely, but all lead to cathartic self discovery.
