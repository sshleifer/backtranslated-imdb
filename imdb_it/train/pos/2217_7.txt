Normally I am skeptical about watching novels or films based on miniseries because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I guess it helps if the author was executive producer and writer, eh?) <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. I can't describe how much I enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The setting ... I expected to see the houses and houses that I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, it wasn't enough to make me feel sorry for the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who has read the novel: you won't be disappointed if you do. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
