At first sight, Who's Singing Over There seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy ?? with only a kind of unusual, silent and slow: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers on a desert landscape, then with a bus and a wonderful group of actors, hide a jewel! <br /> <br /> The bent story and a false rhythm induces you to think, yes it is a comic, but it just makes you realize that it will be a kind film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely not: very funny for a moment, obscure cynical thin on others, its development surprises you for the whole story ?? Very ingeniously and cleverly presented, all the characters are important and the actors give them a full life. <br /> <br /> And what is surprising, is based on a deep observation, a great control of the work of the camera and has a great meaning, and really everything, the general direction and how the details are presented too, which simply makes you forget it's a movie: it's like watching a kind human society, you don't know it yet, taken by a friend behind a camera. <br /> <br /> And you're the one behind him. It's simple and simply exceptional! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong; in no way would this mean the script, the quality of the image, the soundtrack have a kind of amateur way, no, no! It's a great art! <br /> <br /> Why does it flow like a river ?? From the top of the mountain, down to the sea, with all the different types of terrain and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea ?? from a small thing to a main stream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image that I used is the best way I can find to explain all the charm that has Whoing Singing Over There. For me, once again, I take the hammer: simply exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the director is the one who created Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is famous quiet? But as I haven't seen it yet, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have written dithyrambical comments on that film, I fully agree! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known because it is rarely translated, but I am fortunate to have this copy in the original language, with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For fast and empty types of explosions and special effects, avoid them at any cost, it might be too thin and good for you! <Br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I imagine you will not regret it, and if you purchase it, you will have a good company in your personal DVD library, with such no less than they deserved great names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet Orson Welles ***
