Guys and Dolls is a unique character-based game. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class player who accepts a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money to be able to <br /> <br /> run his usual crap game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky would not be able to bring any girl to Havana, Cuba and the "doll" she chose was Sarah <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons) who was the head of a missionary. Sky finally gets drunk <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They end up falling in love with each other, but later she accuses him of something he has not been a part of. Nathan made a crap in the missionary the night they disappeared. Nathan's girlfriend, 14, Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disapproves of Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the film ends, everything ends happily with a double wedding <br /> <br />. The songs in this movie are simply wonderful, no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no real singing voice at all that they could have nicknamed him, but it didn't matter. He did a great job of acting (obviously since it's Brando) and played his character very well. I saw some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought that this film was his weakest, he too couldn't possibly sing. However, the song is composed of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original production of <br /> <br /> by Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a magnificent voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like the musical, and even if you don't, I suggest you watch it.
