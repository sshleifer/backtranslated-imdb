I came across this movie on TV and I couldn't turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely character who falls in love with an extremely warm and likeable Goldie Hawn (who isn't?). The way in which the character of Goldie is maintained from the beginning of the film to the end is still unusual. This film gave me a different angle in human relationships and I found it very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was a difficult sale, but I think he does it well.
