One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, his support comes largely from the poorest regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup d'état deposed Chavez briefly. At the time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, shooting a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup and its consequences and electronically records the history that takes place on the premises, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez aimed to free Venezuela from the free market policies imposed by the United States. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for the private benefit of the leaders that Chavez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela is invaded by poverty, its resources literally sucked into foreign multinationals. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins by representing Chavez's early years as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its various policies that have proved popular with working class locals (education plans, oil revenue distribution, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez has been a great supporter of education and has printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately committed himself to redistributing oil profits. This has understandably made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television stations immediately began to oppose the state television station. They questioned Chavez's motivations, sanity and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would not have succeeded. The film makes it clear that shots depend heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of "restoring democracy", the opposition has silenced the state television station, dissolved the National Electoral Board, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. Monetary interests, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the United States and the CIA), organized a citizens' march on the presidential palace to carry out the coup. The snipers shot Chávez's supporters, but the private media stations modified the footage, so it seemed that the return fire was directed against the opposition march that, in reality, had been safely denied. <br /> <br /> 12. The police were furiously shooting at Chavez's supporters, further bleeding the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, held captive, refused to resign. Of course the media / government have lied saying that he had resigned, but members of Chavez's cabinet communicated the truth to the international community, which eventually reported the message to Venezuela by cable. <br /> <br /> 14. The people rose up, putting pressure on the return of the president they had elected, which only a referendum could replace constitutionally. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - At just over an hour, this document is too short. However, it is a compelling piece of journalism and deals with a form of "media war" that is rarely touched. It is an excellent companion piece for "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
