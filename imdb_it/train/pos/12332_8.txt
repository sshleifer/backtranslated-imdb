Having seen the short many times in the marathons of horror films, I think it is a humorous parody that cuts the main point of its reference. <br /> <br /> Although the themes are crisp and stale for today's viewers, it's not a waste of time crumby. <br /> <br /> Even if being a student film gives little pretense, the demonstration is that it seems carefully made with a budget of little or no dough. <br /> As noted by another reviewer, it's less than ten minutes that it's all the time it takes to clean up the palate with a toast of joy, sit back and idly pass the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this short-film from a movie should be enjoyed as a starter for the reference title and the viewer should relax and roll with it.
