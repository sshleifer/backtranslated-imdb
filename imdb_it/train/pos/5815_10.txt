I was a child ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dances ... He was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a present ... DVD "Moonwalker" ... I couldn't believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again .. After many years, and threw me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but the good old days I remembered more than when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me another point of view than when I was a child. You can really see the parody that Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson for bringing me back to those great moments, to your great music and your dances. It is a pity that people have forgotten you .. I didn't do it because you gave me great moments with your music .. All the best for you, where ever you are out there ..
