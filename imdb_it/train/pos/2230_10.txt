I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I think it was aired on TV in 1983. All I remember was that she was a teenage girl, alone, survived a plane crash and survived in the Amazon. I remember people looking for her (family) and who knew how to take care of herself --- she tells the story and I vividly remember her knowing that the insects were under her skin. I don't remember much else about this movie, and I want to see it again - if this is the same - and if any of you have a copy, could you send me an email at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd be curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. It was aired on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983 and I was going through personal problems and this film had a strong impact on me. Thanks in advance!
