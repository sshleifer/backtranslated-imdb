I saw this film on ENCW the last night for the third or fourth time. We liked it so much I ordered the DVD. This is really a standout and, of course, the first of the Mann-Stewart pairings. More here than usual oater, although not quite as powerful as The Searchers. A lot of obvious symbolism on the achievement of manhood, but mainly is the acting of Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean - Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting because a handsome man would be interested in Lola but too yellow. As Stewart in The Man Who Killed Freedom, he is practically reduced to wearing an apron and serving his enemies with coffee. Decaf without a doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behave as if no Indian on the screen had interesting cameos. <br /> <br /> Special performances by John McIntire as an over-lucky card dealer who gets stuck in a Western version of low-level Rick's American Cafe. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens comes out for a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some good scenes with Stewart before arriving in Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer in the role of Wyatt Earp and the Indian chief who takes Walter Brennan's teeth from him to Red River are pleasant sightings. This is the kind of western that only Stewart, not Wayne and Scott could have achieved. It is worth shooting, I repeat. :-)
