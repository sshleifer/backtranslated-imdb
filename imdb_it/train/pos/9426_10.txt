This is one of the most fun series ever! I laughed until my sides split and rolled on the floor. If only someone could go out in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know it will be released in the UK, but this is region 2 and PAL beyond! Let's give this series its right shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's bizarre and funny role in this. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Release this show in America! or show it again on PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please grant us, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
