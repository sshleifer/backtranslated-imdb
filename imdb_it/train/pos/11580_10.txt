As another reviewer he claims that Hanna's War is an exceptional film about an exceptional person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become the Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately, I am of the opinion that he does not agree that Miss Detmers as a protagonist is too good to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In truth for me his performance is not held back by his beauty, but makes the terror of sadistic brutality as resistance that confronts even more naked. The performance of Maruschka Detmers is courageous, touching, felt or understood and totally credible. In other words for me "In the area". from the headlines. If you would like to know someone else's suffering for something they believe in and have a great time, try Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers. My hat also stands out for Ellen Burstyn, Hanna's mother, a very famous and famous actress who could have made an effort to go out with the film. In this is perhaps a team effort of two actresses but not an All About Eve situation.
