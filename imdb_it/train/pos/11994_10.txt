As for many here I can not help but praise Cast and Crew who developed Talespin and others who realized during My Childhood, I like all those who have commented here we appreciated very much the quality not only of animation but of quality of history lines and characters. <br /> <br /> Classifying this work of art as a "comic strip" could never do justice to justice, in fact it is an insult to classify it as a "cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less, is evidently the greatest work of genius produced at Disney to date, when Disney "Pulled" from the little air understood what they did and I'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret since. <Br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain, From the first one who is the last duckling that I think is Darkwing Duck, Disney has been tormented by failures due to political correctness and has done a quantum leap since, they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of Monkey's for the story, I couldn't have my children watching "cartoons" that numbed now that they feared they would become Homer Simpson sometime in the future and 50% of the guilt would have been for me for allowing them to watch it, I couldn't let that happen, and that's why I have ALL the shows from the late 80s to the mid 90s on a Harddrive so one day my kids couldn't to be corrupted by the "Cartoon Crap" of today and to taste the last piece of childhood that I have and to cling to and I owe everything to Talespin. <br /> <br /> Talespin for me is undoubtedly the best animation ever produced in the world due to it's depth, charm, humor, compassion, emotion and lack of really bad quality and narrative lines that many have today, see some where you say "Ed, Edd and Eddie or whatever you can think of?" the garbage produced today can be compared to the irrepressible 3-year Hyroglyph depicting a Picasso. <br /> <br /> The next time you watch an episode of Talespin; Take a look at the wood grain on any wooden object or building like Higher for Hire and saliva for the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation, even the one shot backgrounds were made as if they were using them again and again, The Buildings seems true to the Art Deco movement that was popular in the time period depicted, even the vehicles are true to life, OK, not all the episodes were fantastic in the animation, but the lower level scenes were covered by the upper scenes, so all in all at the end of the episode it all worked out well and you probably never even noticed, unless you were focused and had a particular attention to detail. <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this is what it likes to call "deliberate mistakes" or "intentional errors" in each episode and some have two, for example in deep sheepskin where Rebecca says " You're up to something about Baloo "and Baloo replies" Who, Me!, I'm innocent as a schoolboy "look at Rebecca's eyes, I won" v ruin the rest of the Baloopers but just keep an eye on next time. <br /> <br /> All the comments of elises are bang on and 100% correct, I have nothing else to add that others have not already said here, Disney, WAKE UP and smell the coffee, you are been asleep for over a decade, stop producing garbage and bring quality back into animations and stop producing "cartoons", we saw evidence of what you can do and we want it back as quickly as possible.
