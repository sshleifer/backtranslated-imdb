This is a rather strange film. It appears as an exploitative film with violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual for being built around rural characters at war with each other, in opposition to an "other" invader. <br /> <br /> The film is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a long series of films that portray veterinarians of that war as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last line is "I haven't lost a war yet" as it reached its end after a long trail of murders and destruction, including the city's police chief and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene. However, Kristofferson is a pretty good and charismatic enough actor to bring this villain with surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with sufficient intensity to cover his goodness. The film bears a certain resemblance to Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The film has a b-movie action, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a splendid Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give him an A-grade lineup. <br /> <br /> I give him a 7 to be seen for some time in an American psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia and confusion and a film industry that was willing to tackle these issues at that time . <br /> <br /> Seen on the THIS channel, a large network that continues to play many old films from the 70s to the 90s, regardless of political inclination.
