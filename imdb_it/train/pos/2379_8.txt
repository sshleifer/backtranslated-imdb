The H.G. Wells Classic has had several incarnations. The 'Speilburg 05' version and the classic 53 'version But only this one remains completely faithful to the book. Nothing has changed nothing is removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. The director re-cuts the film up to 2 hours of pure excellence. He has a vision chapter by chapter of the pages of the novels that "Wells would be proud of". History is how everyone remembers. The Martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of war machines with tripod feet. The people of the 19th century earth are not prepared to repel alien forces and fight with cannons and cannons that hurl the shells tied to the Walkers and when humanity is no longer a world power they are saved by the smallest organism on earth. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent achievement for director Timothy Hines who has great potential when he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget. Today B-Movies have bigger budgets.
