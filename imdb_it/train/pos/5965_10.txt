I gave this 10 points out of 10. I like it so much. I am a child of the 80s and totally in heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons why I like this movie so much. It's so nice to see those posters in that boy's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (revealing the wicked of Exciter, Rise of the mutants of the shock metal master Impaler and Killing is my business at Megadeth). Even the soundtrack of FASTWAY is absolutely incredible and fits the plot very well. If you like metals, then TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Don't buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the film for seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and the story will take you back to the glory of the 80s. You will not be the same person later.
