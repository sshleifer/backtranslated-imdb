The film, which I thought was excellent, had to be a love story with a bit of suspense. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor. I don't know why people keep giving it a bad blow. As for Mel Harris, she is a great actress and for those who think she looks too old for Rob she is only five years old. <br /> <br /> Rob had a starring role in his television series and Scifi Channel I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also starred in numerous TV movies and is now creating a Mini TV series. <br /> <br /> you need to give it more main roles which is what is the best in.
