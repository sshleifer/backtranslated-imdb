At first, this movie looks so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic boredom. But I gave him a second chance, then another and another, etc ... In the end I became addicted to this film, because of its slow dreamlike rhythm, wonderful natural sets, immersed in a sweet autumnal light and in particular the soundtrack, which is composed of a progressive rock from the 70s and absolutely perfect folk songs by actor / singer / author Derek Lamb (Il Trovatore). You should notice the song on hazel wood, the silver trout and the lady that disappear into the air ..., heard in the middle and near the end of the film. There are some carnal scenes at the beginning, let us appreciate the natural charm of Elizabeth Suzuki. If that film had been made by some "repertory" directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would have rolled onto the floor, delirious for that film as if it were a cosmic masterpiece. I personally think that this film is a million times higher than any other film by Fellini # Â¤ @ t! Certainly not for the pretentious.
