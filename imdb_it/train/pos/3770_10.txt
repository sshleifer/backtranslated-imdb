When will people learn that some films are made for fun and are not necessarily destined to change the world? If you realize this, then you expect to have fun watching "Bill and Ted's bogus journey". This is a movie that is a lot of fun to watch, Keanu and Alex make a great team on the screen taking their characters from the excellent "Bill and Ted" adventure with even more "style", then in the first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great for a laugh, the characters are extremely available and the plot is so radical that you have to laugh. Don't expect deep-and-meaningfulls to just expect fun!
