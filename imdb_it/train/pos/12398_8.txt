What was always missing from the Matrix story was how things came true in the real world. Say no more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. What was really interesting was how political it was, maybe even an economic blow in the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that man could think about in the fight against the robotic horde, which were nothing but servants of humanity. What I found interesting is also the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often, letting the lack of logic and thought reach us because people cannot believe otherwise. Well represented and put together, this is a true testament to how illogical humans can be.
