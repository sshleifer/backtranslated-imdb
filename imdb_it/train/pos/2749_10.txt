A good image is worth all the words. This film has the most poetic scene that people with Down syndrome ever dreamed of. And I don't want to ruin it by telling you. You will want to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is a fantastic actor. I didn't need to understand a single word to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has its magic. After looking at it I understood better that we gave too much value to the realization and not enough to the people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
