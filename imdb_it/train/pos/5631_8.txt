Congratulations to Fawcett for taking on roles that, at the time, were considered controversial. In my memory, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were rarely examined so deeply during that time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed, then chased by the actor James Russo. It is as adequate as the psychopathic obsession, but sometimes a little transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a little role, like Alfre Woodard as the home companion. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. The scene in which he throws a pan of hot oil to Russo is classic, and how the rapist deserves it. She then keeps him in slavery, and the consequences must be addressed. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and anger of rape victims who have been violated, physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 8/10.
