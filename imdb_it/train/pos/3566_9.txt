In 1954 Marlon Brando was the hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had yet to reinvent himself on the big screen. But the portrait of Sinatra in the role of Nathan Detroit once helped restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> It is an excellent film version of a great theatrical work and the choices of leads and support players are exceptional. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his only role as a singer in the role of Sky Masterson. In addition, the female lead, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (who revisits her theatrical role as Nathan's long-standing friend, Adelade), has made superlative efforts. A special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye (like Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no version of Rockin 'The Boat arrives even close to Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who will become famous as a television producer of shows like The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show works miracles of "Harry The Horse", BSPulley is excellent as the "bad guy Julie", the way to speak hard and casual also Regis Toomey offers its excellence as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun musicals to watch, a good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "they are your nuts"
