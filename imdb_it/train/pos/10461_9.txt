A vote to love is a wonderful film. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, although different from the film. It really made you think about how you would respond if you were in the characters' shoes. Recommended to anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, ALL! <br /> <br /> Even if the production is not really of Hollywood quality - no great special effect - yet, the values ​​and ideals portrayed more than compensated. And the cast has done a great job in capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill. <br /> <br /> You don't want to miss this!
