Maybe it wasn't so good as a whole, but the second episode, which was the first I said, was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries. <br /> <br /> The companion cockney slang, Chico Barnes, is much more fun for those of us who have never been close to hearing the London Bells Arch, but the contacts are interesting and the shows were interesting . Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand. It is interesting to note that electronic hands of the type used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the type invented after the Second World War.
