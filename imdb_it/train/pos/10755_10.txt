Great documentary about the life of New York firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time .. This reason is why this should be an item not to be missed. What shocked me not only the attacks, but the "High Fat Diet" and the physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think many doctors would agree with me that, in the physical form in which they were, some of these firefighters would NOT arrive on the 79th floor carrying more than 60 pounds of gear. Having said that I now have more respect for the fire brigade and I realize that becoming a firefighter is a life-changing job. The French have a history of making great documentaries and this is what it is, a great documentary .....
