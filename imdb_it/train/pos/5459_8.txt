BABY FACE is a fast, wisely broken rhythm, a smug little smile from a movie that only lasts an hour and 15 minutes, but oh, how clever 75 minutes is <br /> <br /> ! That a story that covers so much ground can be told in such a short time <br /> <br /> puts most movie producers today to be ashamed. The writers of <br /> <br /> today should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut the weight that <br /> <br /> overwhelms so many of their films. <br /> <br /> History is not nonsense. An amoral woman rises to riches first below, <br /> <br /> and then over the bodies of men who fall madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> Of course the production code has loosened it with a redeem, happy ending, <br /> <br /> but it is not difficult to see in which direction the writers wanted <br /> <br / >, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is as formidable as George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as an unfortunate suitor for <br /> <br />. Not a great film but certainly a pleasant one. If you <br /> <br /> have never seen BABY FACE take it the next time it is shown on the cable <br /> <br /> or rent the box. It is worth the effort ..
