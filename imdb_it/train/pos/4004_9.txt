'The Mother' is that extraordinary piece of filmmaking - it makes you think, it doesn't punch - and in the end it leaves you thinking. Very open on the fate of the protagonist. Anne Reid (whom I knew only briefly from her appearances in some of Victoria Wood's projects and thought it was a beautiful comedy) is truly exceptional here. Not the stereotypical widow housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood. And not all that free and adventurous spirit at the beginning. He plays his character only with the right note that sounds real (well, he did it to me). Powerful cast. Great script. Renaissance of European cinema indeed;)
