I was very surprised by this movie. I was touched by the lives that Paulie touched along his way to find his "marie", the child from whom he was separated. Even the humor was very good and did not damage the story as I thought it probably would have worked. Actually I was expecting "paulie wants a cracker" jokes to hurt this movie, but even that was done in a very funny scene that gets very touching when Paul is in the research lab's press conference. So if you want to see a good "talking animal" movie, check this out, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. Even PAULIE has a surprising turn at the end that is performed very well.
