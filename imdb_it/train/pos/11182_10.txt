I'm a big fan of most of the movies that are based on Stephen King's books - this is considered one of the scariest and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I've just finished watching it for about a tenth of the time and I still find it moving and scary. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is on a safe collision route with the monster truck is the one that stands out. And the "No fair" spoken by little Miko Hughes towards the end is a touch of genius. <br /> <br />
