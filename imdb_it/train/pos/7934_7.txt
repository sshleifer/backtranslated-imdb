According to this advice, I believe you love it or hate it. Usually how it goes with all the movies. There is no need to get stinging with others though. All we are doing here is giving opinions. I rented this movie last night and I want to come and cast my opinion on the mix. I was surprised by how many people are beating him though. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a fan of the horror movie. Most simple movie fans don't like horror movies. Nowadays, so many movies are coming to watch low budget films. It's difficult to keep up. And what makes it difficult to stay in these films is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review on "Hood of the Living Dead" because it's damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there. It's nothing special but they are those horror film producers who try to be too serious to end up with a horrible horror movie. I really liked this. Are you telling me that there is no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you all have all these huge DVD collections that you're so proud of, nothing but Major Motion Pictures, right? Nothing wrong with this, but you need to know how to appreciate low budget independence. I knew what I was doing when I saw this movie. I won't be angry because I thought it would be a 100 million dollar movie. Some of you may have to keep looking at the Matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything with Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, that explains it all. Good movie people, take a look.
