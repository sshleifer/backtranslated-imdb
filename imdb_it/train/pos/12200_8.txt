By the time The Lady of Shanghai was being made, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating. The film was both an attempt by Welles to rekindle the old flames and to make a classic noir. The lady from Shanghai, who was not well received, has gained more and more critical acclaim over the years. He improved with age, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Welles is the Irish sailor Michael O'Hara who saves the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three robbers in Central Park on a fateful night. The sparks fly, but then comes the rubbing, it turns out that the lady is married to the lame, but the brilliant criminal lawyer Everett Sloane. Nevertheless, Sloane has an apparent sympathy for Welles and hires him for his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far this movie is starting to sound a lot like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not then thinking with his male member, he would have returned to the sailors recruitment hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead he gets involved in a nice web or intrigue and finds himself tied to two murders and Sloane as his eminent lawyer. <br /> <br /> Welles for some reason decided that his wife would be a blonde in this movie. Presumably Harry Cohn hit the roof while Rita was internationally known for her red and auburn hair. This could have cracked him in the image as he joined the legion of study leaders who saw Welles' vision of independent cinema as a threat to their power. <br /> <br /> Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane Grisby's partner who is a slippery friend, ends up with a corpse. The other body found here is Ted DeCorsia, a private detective who tries to do business on his own. <br /> <br /> It's a good noir thriller, showing Rita at her best glamor even though she was a blonde here. The final screening in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged, but I would not recommend seeing it if you are on a controlled substance.
