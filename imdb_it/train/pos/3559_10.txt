I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs have been changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra does not have the chance to sing so much in this film, but it is also nice that it is not just another Frank Sinatra film where he is above all singing. <br /> <br /> I really thought it was better to use the voice of Marlon Brando because he has the voice that fits and I couldn't see someone with this great voice that brings out the feeling of the gangster of his voice. <br /> <br /> "Sit Down, You're Rockin 'the Boat" by Stubby Kaye is a panacea, a song that I just love. He is a tough act to follow with his version and I still like his best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is simply excellent in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of his songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought that Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I wouldn't have considered it before, but after seeing it in the part, it made sense. <br /> <br /> The choreography of Michael Kidd is timeless. If it were repeated in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I find that many times something has been lost from the stage version to the film version, but this has kept the feel of the stage, even if it was on film. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well launched. I performed in regional versions of this and it is one of my favorites of that period.
