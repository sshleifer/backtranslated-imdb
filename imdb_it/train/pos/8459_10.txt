I'm not a big fan of most souls, but Gundam Wing is really something else. Gundam's wing lacks all that stereotyped melodrama that one might think when one thinks of souls, since the number of jokes made in the 17 hours would only be two-figure, Gundam Wing immediately gets to work. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is as much a political thriller as an action series. Large parts focus on the diplomatic relations of a war, not just on battles. Although the battle animations lack extreme details in cases where it would only be a pain to animate, the individual duels between the gundams are almost works of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this series of 49 episodes plus a series of films was filmed by Cartoon Network in 2000, and later also professionally voiced by them. dubbing is simply impeccable. not only does every word said match, but the voices actually use make the characters much more believable. many believe it is better to watch anime with English subtitles, but I simply don't have the determination to do it. <br /> <br /> The voices are not only good, but the score used in the series is quite impressive. I will only say that he left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what will really attract viewers, and no, you don't engage like a prime-time drama like Lost that was created just for the purpose of attracting you. explaining the plot in depth would have led to many spoilers, since many of the characters don't even have names until a few episodes of the series. The rough idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its now independent space colonies have difficulty maintaining peace. Thus began a war that led to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. I feel that other details will begin to give information, which is fundamental to the plot. <br /> <br /> I will end up here saying that this series is fantastic for all those who love souls, all those who think that ALL souls are stupid (they have good reasons to think so), and anyone who tries to enter souls with a serious tone to it.
