Let's start by saying that the English title of this movie "The Power of Kangwon Province" is an absolute misnomer. It is because in the Hong Sang Soo film there are no real wars, problems and conflicts. So the idea of ​​establishing the power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film. If we were to judge this film with its title in Korean, "Kangwon-do ui him" will appear as a cryptic statement about the emotional turmoil of its young protagonists. Minds are not at rest. Hong Sang Soo has also directed a very prolific visual document on the erratic choices made by people in their lives. The people in question are a couple of girls who are constantly in the process of showing their moods, their whims and fantasies. If the making of a film from nothing can be claimed as a meritorious virtue of a director, Hong Sang Soo must be hailed as a courageous director whose films speak of omnipresent nullity of relationships, feelings and human lives. For those who like it or not, this is the only fair conclusion that can be deduced from this particular film.
