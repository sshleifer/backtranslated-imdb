This was a must-see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely going to see the repetition. I really sympathized with the main character of the film, because, this is true, I have a milder condition than the skin problem he had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad documentary, sometimes funny and very exciting about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy talks like a child (due to the waste of vocal muscles) and has never gone through puberty, but is 36 years old. Most moments of sympathy are seeing his terrible condition, and the bandages come off. Jonny had a rather unpleasant sense of humor, he even told from beyond the grave when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. He won the BAFTAs for best editing and the best new director (Factual), and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and the Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 on 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. A must-see!
