When this film was inaugurated in 1976, legend has it that it was greeted with great derision and disdain - it was widely considered a failure. I vividly remember that Ebert gave him a star and was allegedly booed in Cannes. <br /> <br /> Apparently these people did not understand the film, which is not so difficult to understand as it is very esoteric, obscure and layered in ways that still amaze me. Reading through many of the reviews here I find (even after about 7-8 views over the years) many elements of the film I had previously flown over. But even without much understanding of the psychological basis of the story, it is still a cracking suspense ... even if one takes the increasing paranoia and persecution that surpasses the Polanski title character as a tsunami wave during the execution time of two hours. br /> <br /> Examining the source material --- an excellent novel by the underrated novelist Roland Topor - discover more intriguing layers. Polanski's Trekovsky is a thousandth of the highest level. Although at first glance it appears to be yet another mild soul of every day, little by little we understand that it is one of those people that seems to wander aimlessly in life, letting it direct. He seems to have few strong feelings in his tastes and dislikes. He finds himself gently pushed to one side and the other, but he never seems too deformed, regardless. This vague drowsiness is more evident in the novel than in the film, but there are also hints at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Playing a game for a woman's apartment, a Mademouiselle Choule, who is in the hospital to recover from a recent suicide attempt, seems to be the most daring thing I've ever tried (even negotiating effectively the price of the deposit in the deal). Soon, however, he discovers that he is paying for his "good thing" in more ways than he cares, since he finds himself in the center of the vortex created by a building full of neurotic control patients who are hypersensitive even to the slightest sign of life human, like a step in the night or a blow to the door. <br /> <br /> Instead of taking a position, Trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated from the situation and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution. Become obsessed with Choule, imagining himself to be like her, dressing like her, etc. When his own personality quickly begins to be swept away by his own madness. <br /> <br /> If anyone has ever doubted Polanski's lack of fear as an artist, they would be well advised to watch this movie. His characteristic black humor is in the foreground (and sometimes embarrassing) in the show and --- god bless him --- he gets his ass done. It's a tour de force performance in one of the richest, riskiest and gothic horror movies ever made. That more people haven't seen it is a real crime.
