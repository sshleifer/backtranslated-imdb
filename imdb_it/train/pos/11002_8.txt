The director Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller that, although it requires a certain suspension of beliefs and a lot of concentration, manages to be a really fun experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife, decides to add a little spice to his worldly existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at the high company -Tech Digi Corp. Its task is to travel for conferences throughout the country (under the presumed identity of Jack Thursby) and secretly transmits the speeches returned to its leaders, through an ingenious little electronic marker. <br /> <br /> In reality, however, the speeches are only a cover for much more nefarious activities. Morgan, along with his conference participants, is being brainwashed. The drugged water they are drinking puts them in a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget their past and permanently adopt their new identities. Once they are totally convinced that they are someone else, they are told to stand for a job with rival companies, where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion. <br /> <br /> But the plans of Digi Corp are falsified by the intervention of lozenge agent-for-hire Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), which opens Morgan's eyes on what is really happening. It gives Morgan an antidote to the mind that alters drugs so they can resist brainwashing techniques. He also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects he does not fully believe he is Jack Thursby, then he will be "eliminated". Morgan plays and applies for a job at the rival company Sunways. <br /> <br /> However, arriving at his new workplace, he is subjected to a polygraph test and is immediately sounded as a spy. Fortunately, Sunways leaders consider this an ideal opportunity to provide false data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From here on out, things get progressively more complicated; the twists and the poor old Morgan end up not being able to trust anyone. In an exciting ending, everything eventually becomes clear (but only if you followed the events very carefully). The director Natali manages the proceedings with confidence and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy film for a relatively low budget. He manages to get great shows from his talented cast; Jeremy Northam, in particular, is fantastic: his portrait of the initially nervous Morgan is played to perfection. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating film by a director who is willing to risk and I look forward to his future projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
