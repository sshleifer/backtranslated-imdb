Hey, now, I can't say I saw all the films of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and surely there are many, but this is one of the best (and most bizarre) of the lot I've seen. I would most likely say that he was in the middle of his career in the late sixties and early seventies and anything lately has been a little too strange for me, and it takes me a lot to declare it. However, this is like a big bad dream in which parts of it seem to come true at various points. This woman is an actress or something, she performs in some Berlin theaters where "fake" torture acts are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) And she seems to have this problem with dreams. The grip of what is real and what is not there in this film is apparently the real stuff is focused and the dream is not. You seem to exist in a state of déjà vu. I will not say that this makes much sense but it is rather wild, strange and funny. The shots in Berlin make it seem a lonely and disturbing place, so that adds to the atmosphere. The ending is extremely abrupt, but the film ends and the tape has turned black, I don't need to let you know that it was finished at that point. My copy came from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can't get enough of that shit. But it's GOOD shit.
