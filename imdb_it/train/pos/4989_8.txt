This is very dated, but it's part of the charm of this 1933 movie. You can say the same for most Pre-Code movies; they are just different, and usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was the short execution time, the great acting of Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and the sweetness of the character of Loretta Young that made me watch and have fun this attractive but intriguing movie. <br /> <br /> You would be hard pressed to find a prettier girl than "Trinna", played by Young, 20, who was already making her 50th movie! (He started acting like a little girl, and the fact that they were making movies in the old days soon.) The camera, though suffused for much of the film, magnified Loretta's face and eyes many times and I was hypnotized by its beauty. <br /> <br /> Reproducing a bizarre man with a cynical view of life, Tracy's "Bill" slowly turned into a loving man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer made his lines here so naturally that you barely knew you were acting. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, supporting actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave long lasting impressions long after watching this 75-minute movie. I was particularly fascinated by the role of Connolly as a minister / father figure in the camp. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit far-fetched but - hey - it's the movies. This story is about two lonely victims of the Great Depression trying to survive in a "Hooverville" type camp and turning into a very touching story.
