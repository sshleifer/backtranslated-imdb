**** SPOILER ALERT **** Throughout Australia, summer has turned into a flood of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that were causing havoc in coastal cities like Sydney. It is in these frenetic conditions that tax lawyer David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, was involved in a case as a defense lawyer, involving the death of a local aboriginal who was found dead outside a bar in Sydney. <br /> <br /> With five companions of aborigines arrested for Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, the death is determined by the medical examiner who Billy died drowning not violently, even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. Yet the court decided to try the five for his death by accusing them of manslaughter instead of murder. <br /> <br /> David who defends the five does not get help from them in their defense with the assailants accused of staying enough and keeping what happened to Billy to themselves and taking what is coming to them from the court. One of the defendants, Chris, David Gulpili, somehow begins to invade David's dreams as if he wanted to tell him what was really behind Billy's death. <br /> <br /> David doesn't take his dreams seriously at first Chris begins to sense that they are real when they meet him in court. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange black rock that David saw in Chris' dreams. Later meeting Chris and, who turns out to be an aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula) who came to his house that night, David is told that he, like Charlie, has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather. Those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent. The earth, says Chris to David, is going through a gigantic purification cycle with the old world that is being swept away and the new world ready to take its place. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what both Chris and Charlie are saying, but as the rains continue to rise and the ocean waves start to rise, he feels something terrible is about to happen. David wants to know if it's all the aboriginal folklore or there are some scientific facts, or logic, behind their end of world-class revelations. <br /> <br /> It is now obvious that both Chris and Charlie are members of an Aboriginal tribe right in the heart of modern Sydney. This alone can send Chris away, as well as his four friends, to Billy's murder. Since the Australian government will not punish tribal aborigines, leaving justice to the tribes themselves. Still Chris refuses to admit to being a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in Billy's death with the sentences the judge must pronounce in a few days. <br /> <br /> David now determined to find out what was the reason for Chris's silence, and why Billy had to die, he is brought to Chris's crime scene. That's where David finds out that Billy has betrayed Chris tribe members by going there with Billy not being a member of Chris's aboriginal tribe. It has also been revealed to David that he himself has some sort of spiritual connection with the Australian aborigines, as they have told both Charlie and his stepfather, Rev. Burton, David Parslow. <br /> <br /> The stage is now ready for the great and definitive cleaning cycle that David has seen both in his nightly dreams and in his day visions. It comes in the form of a huge tidal wave that stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Australian coast, city of Sydney, to then submerge the entire continent.
