During the entire movie, Paramount Pictures of Pirates of the Caribbean lost the ball in the restoration of this Anthony Quinn-directed film Cecil B. DeMille and obtained on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs is as blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a good pirate movie in their vault on a real pirate who lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, who would help make The Crescent City once new famous for its Pirate Connections. When the Paramount Execs eventually get the program and publish this film in digital format, then I'll be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures it's up to you to get out of your duff and get this movie restored now!
