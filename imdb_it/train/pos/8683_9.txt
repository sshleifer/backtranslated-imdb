"Death Lend A Hand" is one of the first key episodes of "Columbo" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of four appearances by Robert Culp (three as a murderer), playing the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this case Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr. Kennicut, had an affair. Although he is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in exchange for pieces of information about her husband's business partners. She reacts badly to this suggestion, it follows a discussion that quickly becomes violent when Brimmer hits her on the face. Because she wears a big ring, the blow makes her fall to the ground and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is one in which Columbo pretends to read the handheld, although this is actually a ploy to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring. Columbo being Columbo, reveals only what it really knows when it's the right time to turn the screws a little. So initially he interprets in a stupid way the part of a rather simple man who gets excited with the "lifeline that flies over the mound of the moon", or with an equally ridiculous mumbo-jumbo that reads the reading of palms. <br /> <br /> Another The best scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his company, effectively corrupting it to stop poking around. Once again, Columbo does not reveal that he knows what is happening, he claims to be honored and excited by this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there is another in which Columbo tells Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that he wants the killer to hear their conversation. He wants to suggest to Brimmer that he is on him, without accusing him directly, so he is rather cruelly (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play mindgames on Brimmer to scare him and do something stupid. Which of course does! All the while, the mournful Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It is only towards the end that Columbo explains everything to Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I won't reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights, but let's just say there's a potato involved. .. <br /> <br /> A very beautiful episode, perhaps the best of the first series. If you liked it, you will also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
