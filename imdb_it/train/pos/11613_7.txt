The distortion is a film that took me by surprise .. A sort of multi-level drama that focuses on a man who writes a play about his life experience that is happening to him right now. To be more concise, he feels his wife is cheating on him, so he takes a private eye to look around him. His wife has no idea that it's happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play also have a pair of monkey skirts rolled up their sleeves, joking with each other and, say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. Everything culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable (but not really) happens. <br /> <br /> The director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the cast of characters and the changes in a way that makes you pay attention, actually it's a fun movie, one that I wouldn't mind seeing and would recommend people to check out.
