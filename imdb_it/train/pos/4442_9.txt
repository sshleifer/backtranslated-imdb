The Orco is a film made for TV in Italy and was not designed to be a sequel to Demons, as Lamberto Bava also mentions it in the Sheirk Show DVD interview, but was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series . The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80s rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two were gory horror Demons III: The Ogre is an architectural horror so it's like Demons III is not an appropriate sequel to Demons but I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is creepy and this adds a tone to the castle in which the film is set, The orc is another thing because I like the film. There are two other films classified as Demons III, namely Demons Blacks (Demons 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The orc is a good movie as long as you don't compare it with Demons and Demons 2.
