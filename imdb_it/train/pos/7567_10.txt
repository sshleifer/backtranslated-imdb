An excellent film that describes the cross currents in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of uncommon people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid direction and writing together with the acting, in particular the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. It is interesting to note that this film was made in the same year as the famous "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as hectic as that in the city of Los Angeles, and the characters might seem better to know each other in "Apart From That", but the personal relationships of the characters are problematic and problematic and their stories resonate like those of " Crash ". For those spectators who have enjoyed "Crash" this is a must-see movie. Furthermore, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will appreciate this film.
