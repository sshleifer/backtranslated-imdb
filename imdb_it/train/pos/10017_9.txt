I absolutely LOVED this movie! I do not refer at all to all the other comments I have read about it. I was completely fascinated by every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story compelling, the acting intense and the theater direction. I would literally jump whenever the phone rang near the end of the film. Although there was nothing "scary" in the story itself, I was profoundly untidy throughout the film - and for the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I discovered that there were so many perfect choices made ... the casting, the script, the little pieces of humor sprayed into it. There were so many points where the film could have gone for the economic thrill, but it never happened, and this has put this film on so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately ... number of years.
