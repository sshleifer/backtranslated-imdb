A retro-ghostly action thriller, ugly and mean, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), The murderers of the girl she was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is not aware of or cares for 30 years of social progress. I really don't think we're going to see a more violent movie soon, so you better go see it while you can. Despite his relentless sadness, I think the film is a powerful example of cinema in its most sinister, exploitative and effective aspect. Scott has a difficult thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply amazing and brings out a great performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this, but I have recommended it to those spectators who are looking for a fantastic movie full of action.
