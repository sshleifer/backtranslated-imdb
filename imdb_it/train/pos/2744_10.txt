Remarkable, disturbing film about the real life, the senseless and brutal murder of a small town family, along with the consequences and examination of the lives of the murderers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> it matters how much time passes, or how this film may seem dated, the total incomprehensibility of criminal acts like this still resounds. <br /> <br /> Multiple traces of tragedies: the tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family, a decent peasant family in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith. <br /> <br /> An interesting point is made in the film: that none of these two immature, frightened, petty criminals would ever have thought of facing something like this alone. But together they created a dangerous and murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other along a path of reciprocal "demonstration". That they were men enough to do it, to run it; nor does he want to be seen as too cowardly to complete their great "score"; an unfortunate and dangerous remnant of the desolate lives they led. They were two adult children who live in the world of a criminal without giving up on ire; who constantly needs to demonstrate manhood and tenacity. in this case, these needs were brought up to the Clutter murder. <br /> <br /> The film contains a somewhat sentimental look at the Clutter family, but the point is made. They were respected people, respectful of the law and of the province, who did not deserve this terrifying fate. The film also gives us an idea of ​​the young lives of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose first life was full of security and love, but he watched in horror as alcohol brought his family on a tragic journey. Hickok, poor and left almost to his own devices, is unable to see how he fits, using his intelligence and his fascination with everyone he came into contact with. <br /> <br /> An interesting, and perhaps the first, look at the death penalty, and what ends we hope to achieve. It is nothing but a revenge that kills for a homicide that has shaken a nation at a time when we have not yet had to face completely that there could be similar predators among us, or putting these guys at the end of a rope actually provides a deterrent to the childish and brutal posture of men like these? Is it possible to discourage men who live lives of deception by operating under the radar, believing they are cheating all those they come into contact with? To be discouraged, you must believe that it is possible that you will be caught. Is it possible to discourage these men who believe they are too intelligent to be captured? who committed hundreds of small crimes and got away with them? This had to be a "cinch", "no witness". <br /> <br /> When he is captured, Hickok discovers that he cannot fascinate and with the agents the way he had committed for the department stores. Smith, who believes he still deserves such a fate, which seemed to be the only one to really grasp the gravity of what they had done, gladly tells the story when he finds out that Hickok has cowardly surrendered. Hickok blinked first. A stupid chicken game between two immature, emotionally damaged and dangerous men. <br /> <br /> Fascinating psychological thriller, which tells a story of a horrendous crime in the history of this nation. Stunning representations of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles have made their careers.
