Kate Beckinsale is just as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow in the role of Emma in this film, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other version of Emma. They are both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting, almost, though. And I also liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie ... she was much sweeter and sentimental. There are some things I like best about Gwyneth Paltrow's version, though, as the humorous side is more evident.
