There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lives, but for one reason or another we remember these people for the rest of our lives. These once-in-a-lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between them and there are always some natural reasons why we don't meet these people anymore. We don't always know their names, because we are never introduced to them, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It is strange how common humanity makes friends occasional and we like to keep it as such, because reunification can ruin good memories, or we don't know how to do it. We are too afraid to verify it. <br /> <br /> The film "Before Dawn" surprised me to watch it. I never intended to watch it, but since the discussion between the couple looked interesting, I took a look at the rest of the film. I didn't know what to expect from this, but neither did the young couple. They had time to argue with each other until dawn and whatever could happen before they parted. I think this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has experienced at least once or twice. It makes us think of all those people we met only once in our lives.
