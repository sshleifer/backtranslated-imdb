Ah, I loved this movie. I think he had it all. It made me laugh out loud more than a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing this from a girl's point of view. I think it's a shame to have scored only 5.2 points. Too many guys who vote? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a female, I don't like all chic movies, on the contrary I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be superficial and not as fun as they wanted to be. But like I said, this movie had everything, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good jokes, good acting. Although the character of Eva Longoria Parker reminded Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives a lot, so what? It was amazing. I'll keep this movie for rainy days, days when I'm down and I need some laughs.
