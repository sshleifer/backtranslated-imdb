All I've heard is how badly the animation is done. It may not be up to what everyone expects, but look at it this way. Would you expect perfection in hell? I am convinced that the animation has been made dry and spirited on purpose. It was great to see his transformation of the character in this film, considering that he will probably be the closest to the live action we've ever had. I hope for a sequel very soon. If we want a live action, I think we could get better with Chastity or Purgatori. I don't think Lady Death moves well to the cinema. Anyway, it is my personal belief that all the opponents of this film are DEAD. No pun intended.
