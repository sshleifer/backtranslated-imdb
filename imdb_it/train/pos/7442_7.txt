I rented the film (I don't think he had a theatrical distribution here) expecting the worst. The previews made the film horrible. In fact I was very surprised, it was worth looking at; it was freely scripted, almost like an ensemble film. There have been very funny moments and even if imperfect it is an effective satire on the show and in the people of the show without being too pungent. It is imperfect, mainly from the horrible soundtrack of the "comedy" effects, but on the whole it appears honest and generally true to the form of the show in an altmanesco way or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> time is the fashion to be critical of Jerry Springer, it's also an easy goal. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and been declared "the worst film ever made". I recommend this film to anyone interested in the show. An imperfect but innovative and interesting film.
