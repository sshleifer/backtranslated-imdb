I like all versions of this story, but this is my all-time favorite. George C. Scott provides a depth to the Scrooge character that others do not give. The film shows more about why it becomes so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and incidents that show him. <br /> <br /> This film has the best Tiny Tim by far. He has the right age, rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager like in the other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his milk teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is as wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. It portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity not as a damp man who crouches under the shadow of Scrooges, but as a man who bears him with grace because he has a family to support. Susannah York and the other actors do a great job giving life to the characters. Edward Woodward is the best ghost of the Christmas gift I've ever seen. Very often he is interpreted as a wild-type Santa character. In this shows anger at the attitudes of Scrooge and really does reconsider Scrooge. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets really bring Dickens's London to life. A wonderful film.
