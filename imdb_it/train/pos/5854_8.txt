This game is fun and has a storyline you could expect to see in comics. The spider man was framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is invaded by a strange gas, and symbiotics like those of Venom and Carnage appear throughout the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, it looks like he turned a new leaf. Even Venom does not seem to be involved because it has just emerged that Spider-man apparently cost him a rather good photographic opportunity. Well cameos of other heroes and many criminals later Spidey will untangle the mystery. Combat is simple, not difficult to collect, boss fights are pretty fun. You get to collect comics, the web runs out and it's a bit fun to walk through the city. However, this is also a weak point. The swing is not exceptional as all you do is hover in the city as the Spider-Man seems to stick his canvases to the sky. Also, you don't have much web handling, especially compared to a Spider-man 2 video game. However, it compensates for the rather ugly swing with other elements, especially history. So get ready to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for an action-packed run.
