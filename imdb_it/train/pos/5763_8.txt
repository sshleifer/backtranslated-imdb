<br /> <br /> I have to admit to having enjoyed bad movies. I love them all look at them. Horror in particular. My friends and I all get together after a hard week at school and at work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a great time. One of the ones we got in Hollywood Video, was this, Zombie Bloodbath. This one had a big box, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project that was built on a nuclear plant that covered the aboveground with bulldozers, and the other underground layers are simply covered. The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered structure when some children fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this moment on, it's a chunk-city. The effects and the action of the gore never stop until the credits arrive. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not great art, but this one, with its in-joke dialogue and awful and extravagant stuff, was our favorite of the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party ribbons" I've ever had the pleasure of watching. And one could say that it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild journey.
