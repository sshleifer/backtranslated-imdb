Some DVDs own me until I have to go out and buy it. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing him as a child and I loved him. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that had been cut, so I was intrigued to see what they could be. I agree that the "Portabellow Road" sequence is now a bit long (as in the case of the soccer game), but apart from that, I didn't find any problems with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place. Perhaps Disney should have had the original version (which is the restored version) on one side with the restored version on the flip side, so people could choose what they wanted to view. All in all, it's still a fun movie that still manages to regain some of my childhood memories.
