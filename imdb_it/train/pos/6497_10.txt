I must have seen it a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw him in B & W on the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set for kids and I'm showing them. They do not teach history at school and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. Expands their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> impartially, with the participants from all sides explaining with their own words what they did and why, detailing what led to the war and the war itself. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your children, along with Alistair Cooke's America. Watch it with them and make them understand. You will be so happy to have done it.
