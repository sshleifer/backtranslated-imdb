This film is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty nice. Even the acting was great, as were the costumes, the production, the photography, the direction and the script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family, on vacation ran aground in the middle of nowhere after hitting a deer. A hunter then appears and is very angry and indignant that one of the deer horns is broken. Then he starts haunting the family and strange things start happening to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's worth it. Congratulations to the cast, crew and directors. Two thumbs up!
