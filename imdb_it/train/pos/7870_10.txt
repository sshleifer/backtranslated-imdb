The film is a true spectacle of how superior society has no emotions and has become selfish. It has a lot of characters and each character represents a different category of people. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad, but all are simply different. The film is a perfect mix of emotions, dramas and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that raised some social questions. I would recommend everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers Bollywood hip-shaking parties for the newspaper, but this is the story of how she becomes a newspaper crime journalist. But that's not all, so show how he couldn't survive there and when he helped save some innocent children, how brutally his voice is suppressed. She is also fired from work. So she couldn't find a job as a crime reporter and she had to start over. Not only her, but a very large number of characters are intertwined in the film and everyone gives different feelings while watching the film. I would really like to congratulate the director for making such a beautiful film. Please do not allow yourself to miss it.
