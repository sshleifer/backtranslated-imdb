Yes, I remember this! Many years since I really saw it. The story was completely surreal, but still fantastic! What everyone who evaluates and reviews films should keep in mind is what the respective film aims at. It is the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Some films, like this one here, only aim at trivial and comic nonsense. Such films cannot be evaluated from the point of view of a hypercritical critic. Of course these films lack quality, lack a sophisticated plot, often lack first-class acting, but if they meet their primary premise - that's fine. I don't have this movie here on my all-time favorite list, but I still thought it was funny, it had some very funny sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is still a smart actor.
