This is very good, made for TV movies. Describes the problems in the suburbs of the 70s and the kind of neighbors they certainly don't want to have around. The worst and most shocking part of the film was when the punk boys killed the family dog. Teenagers do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy !, the main character gets revenge on those punk teenagers in the end. The father / homeowner certainly does not take all the aggravation of punk boys lightly and quickly re-evaluates after the lack of police assistance. He gets up and protects his home and his family. A very good actor ... I could add. <br /> <br /> I saw this on TV when I was 8 or 9 years old. I've never seen him on TV again and I'd love to. Definitely good! It's the kind of movie that you can capture on a weekday night, very late at night, and can't stop watching or an afternoon movie on a weekend. It is the type that no longer show. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing!
