In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, comes The FBI Story, one of those carefully controlled films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. Even though he's a 48-year-old director, J. Edgar Hoover was alive, he wouldn't have been shown in any other kind of light. <br /> <br /> Don Whitehead's book on which this film is based is a direct story of the Bureau since its founding in 1907 until the movie The FBI Story came out. Sometimes it is important to remember that there was an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover guided him. Some of those times are also covered in the film. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers wasn't making a documentary to give the FBI a flesh-and-blood fictional character from John 'Chip' Hardesty. Hardesty, played by James Stewart, is a FBI career man who graduated from law school and instead of going into practice took a job with the office in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> In real life the Bureau was headed by William J Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. Indeed, it was a grossly political operation, as seen in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the Harding administration scandals. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to introduce law enforcement techniques and strict standards of competence, he did just that. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family, which is Stewart and his wife Vera Miles, we see the FBI story unfold. We also see much of their personal family history that is completely integrated into the FBI history itself. Stewart and Miles are definitely an all-American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases in which Stewart is involved, arresting Ku Klux Klan members, a plot to assassinate oil-rich Indians, bring down the notorious 1930s criminals, their involvement with the arrest of Nazi sympathizers during the second world war and against the communists espionage in the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There is a sort of section of the prologue in which Stewart teaches a lesson to the FBI Academy before he enters the history of the Bureau that is intertwined with his. This implies a bomb placed on an airline by a son who bought a lot of insurance on his mother's life before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the creeps as an author and the plot is sadly relevant today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not all American. The FBI still has a story to tell and it's not at all negative. <br /> <br /> The FBI Story is not one of the best Jimmy Stewart films, but it is the first one I have ever seen with my favorite actor in it so it has a special passion for me. If the entire FBI was composed by Jimmy Stewarts, I'd feel much better. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as a friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shooting with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles has not just married Stewart, she has in fact married the FBI as a movie demonstrates. It is dated mostly, but still has an interesting and interesting story to tell.
