"Telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a program of hurried filming, which is why this film always tends to ruin the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott perfectly embodies Ebenezer Scrooge, fully incorporating all his cold tendencies, and still makes him a sympathetic character. The production value of this film was exceptional, without ever relying on boffo special effects or soundstage sets, but relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and solid backdrops. A film that surely stands alone.
