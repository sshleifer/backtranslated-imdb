A complex story set against the background of the Bharat partition. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl and a polite Hindu who burns the harvest of a Muslim man - but in the end you end up appreciating both. The story is powerful, but the script and the flow are hesitant. The background music and the songs are exceptional. Following is the memorable performance of veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography captures the weather, the violence and the taste of rural Punjab very well. Other actors did not play well or did not have the opportunity to act. The management is really the weakest link. The characters have not been developed well. Not sharp, in contrast to "the Earth", where even a character of 5 lines leaves a mark. The end is very interesting. This story could have several endings - and all could have been equally good.
