If, unlike some of the commentators here, you are not organizing a class war and you don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are successful enough, extrovert, bohemian (out of breath) and not being terribly English at a party and getting into all consequently this is not a bad film, closer to European cinema rather than an imitation of the usual American chat ... I think the minimal sound design and the economic camera are a conscious decision rather than a bad film production, defend this , the film is no worse than that, and puts the spotlight on the cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie - I think it's her name, since the sarcastic drunk is apt) an exception is David Baddiel, a which should never be allowed to appear in serious matters !! It's light, and we're not going to do this kind of anatomization rubbish of the relationship in this country, but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with, you could do worse than sit down and watch This.
