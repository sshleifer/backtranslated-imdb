Delightful Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in excellent shape as a middle-aged spinster whose interest turns into witchcraft in WWII England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film and she is ideal for the part. It's Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it's for the benefit or for the children and for the mother England at a time of great danger. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor of witchcraft in an attempt to obtain certain information about witchcraft. Those 3 little darlers sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are simply wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us, regardless of age. <br /> <br /> Too bad Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe have been given so little to do in this catchy movie. <br /> <br /> I really thought about the Ben Stiller movie - "Night at the Museum," at the end of the film, when the relics come to life to fight with the Nazi invasion of the small British coastal town.
