The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are both fantastic in supporting roles in characters who both have more than the eye meets. Jean Simmons is pretty good and Trevor Howard is a hero of fascinating and unconventional suspense.
