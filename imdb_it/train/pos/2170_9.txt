I think that the creator (or creators) of the concept of this film deserves much more praise than they probably ever received. Obviously it's not an Oscar-winning movie, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in theater). <br /> <br /> I don't think this is (and I hope it isn't) a spoiler, but: imagine you are acting on your impulses. Doing the first thought that comes to mind, saying the first words on your lips ... No restraint, no awareness, nothing that keeps you from saying or doing things that, as intelligent adults, we know we shouldn't say or do. If nothing else, this film only scratches the surface - it doesn't go as far as it could go. <br /> <br /> In an age when Hollywood seems obsessed with redoing the old "classics" to try to collect today, it wouldn't be nice to see them redo an old film of modest success, for the sake of bringing it to the next level ? A little further away, or even to explore what the original crew didn't have, wouldn't it or couldn't have faced 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion anyway. : OR)
