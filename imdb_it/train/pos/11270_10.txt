Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most beautiful Jane ever and there will never be a beautiful one again. It is visually stunning. Apart from that, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. Not only does he have the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feeling of the continuous saga. We become involved with the two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other, a mischievous catalyst whose character can be one of the best defined and best examined in the history of cinema. And these characterizations are what make this a great action movie stand out as a classic. There is the unpleasant racism that is portrayed. However, Africans are represented as individuals, and in the end, two even become more heroic than white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the unnamed one probably evokes more sympathy from the audience than any other character. Furthermore, the ending is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great attack of the lions has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implicated with the reactions of the characters more than a modern gore movie with the graphic representation would do. If I left something out, it's because I don't want to dirty the picture for those who haven't seen it. But that's all you could want in a movie.
