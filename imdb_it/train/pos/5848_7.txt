And I gave a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because damn well cradled. At the time when there were so many other shows that were related to toys / games, this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. As others have said, it was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is why the show was condemned. They have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope it comes out more. <br /> <br /> How this vision is compared by looking at 20 years after it came out. I don't know that I like it despite the sometimes awkward animation, and that IMHO is just a flaw. The script was almost first-rate and far ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope to have more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in the correct order. .. The DVDs are good but I don't think the stories are in their proper order, but despite this the show has rocked.
