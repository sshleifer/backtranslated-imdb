I have read some reviews and am rather sad that many of the stories seem to be ignored. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie - in the US or Canada - or anywhere. <br /> <br /> Colm Feore does it, at least for an "F @ g-Hag" recovery like me, a great job not only in acting gay homosexual, but playing badly. I mean, man can't get much paler! However, you may never know it from the bottom strip near the ... um, end. <br /> <br /> If you need decrepit, there are some SK movies you might like. <br /> <br /> Being the daughter of an Alcholico who is recovering, his drug addict {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I will give him credit, he has grown rapidly and he believes me to be good. And, as an aspiring writer, I can dig many of his insights and panoramas. But I'm more prosy than poetic. <br /> <br /> I could be easy to satisfy, but I liked it. A beautiful story well combined, by Canadians, surprises. I have just followed the line of the film "Week of the week", failing to be so drawn out, PRETTY appreciated. And he was portrayed quite intelligently.
