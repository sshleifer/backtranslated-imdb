This is what I expected when Star Trek DS9 debuted. DS9 not light. It was a wonderful show in its entirety, but it never really gave the fans what they wanted. The company is that show. Despite having a resemblance to the original trek, it is quite different from being original in its own ways. It makes exploring ideas exciting for us again. And that was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient of success has been the relationships that have evolved among crew members. The spectators really care about the crew. The company also has many promises in this sector. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel that tensions over businesses can lead to much more and say much more than is typical. I think that when we deal with characters so big of different races or species, we get very interesting ideas and television. Furthermore, we should note the performances, Blalock is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a whim and a strength of character that offers a great performance. The rest of the cast also performed well. My only complaints are the following. The theme. Okay it's different, but a little light for my taste. We need something grander. It doesn't have to be orchestral. Perhaps something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. And my other complaint. They sell too many supplements. They could solve this problem by selling less advertising, or by having all the concerts be two. Otherwise we will end up seeing the final act of the shows being wrapped up too fast as was one of my complaints about Voyager.
