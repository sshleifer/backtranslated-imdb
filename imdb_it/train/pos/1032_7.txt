A message movie, but rather good. Exceptional cast, from top to bottom. Interesting because the Bette Davis plot is essentially a past history! The extremely negative reviews (the name that launches to the script / playwright, associating it in some way with extremely negative comments about "Angles in America", etc. etc.). Damn, this is just too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me. <br /> <br /> Film and theater production and acting styles vary over time and, of course, 70 years later, this particular film would not be made in this respect. Yes, Casablanca is a better film (I guess), but although it was made in the same year and with both Nazis, Casablanca is mainly a love story. The love story in this film takes second place in the spy storyline - more than a thriller. Both have a rather high number of somewhat approximate accents and wonderful actors. Children ARE a little boring and may have been modified
