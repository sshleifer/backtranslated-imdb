Halloween is one of the best examples of independent films. It is very well done and has more psychological elements than what you could realize at first sight. It's a simple film, very well told. The music is perfect and it's one of the most compelling scores ... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you have to check it out. The cast is fantastic. I wish they had never made sequels after the sequel. The first was by far the best and should have ended up as if it were without a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the film. It didn't seem to grow old (it's just as beautiful today, without the hairstyle and clothes of the seventies). Scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!
