This film (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are FANTASTIC! Among other things, there are many. The fight for recruits at the Peacekeepers headquarters is particularly good. There's just something about a single guy who's sucking a bunch of people that is really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this look good on her (but others don't). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He's a great fighter and a macho character, and was a good rival for Wincott in this film.
