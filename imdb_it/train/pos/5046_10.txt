There is such nonsense about the channels of the cable films that I found a jewel with this. From the beginning to the end it drove me crazy and deserves top marks. <br /> <br /> Father of two children listens to the messages of "God" to kill the people who have been called "demons". <br /> <br /> When the opening credits showed the director one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad movie; exceptionally it is the opposite here because the drama does not stop from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> And there is not a moment in the film when one is not completely fascinated because there are no useless or useless subtitles, and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors perform quite convincingly, especially the protagonist child actor who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as "Silence of the Lambs".
