"Convicts" is a kind of third act film. All the dialogue and interaction between the characters that take place within it derive from the long end of a southern day. And, by extension, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years before, they worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful", a film that seems almost full of action compared to this. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, it is barely this side of adequate. The slow pace leaves a lot of room for director of photography Toyomichi Kurita, who infuses the film with the right sense of fragile light and warmth. <br /> <br /> Because this is essentially a film shot, with little in terms of modifying or directing feat, everything comes to acting. For me there are no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are completely real, not interested in anything other than living. Lukas Haas, a young actor with whom I was familiar with "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character very similar to his previous roles. It's quiet, somehow withdrawn, slightly frightened and sad. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is a disservice to this film. That title, along with the opening scene, seems to create an image of a much higher western type photo. If slow-paced theatrical productions don't interest you terribly, we advise you to pass on this too. Otherwise, this could be exactly the movie you want to have made more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself.
