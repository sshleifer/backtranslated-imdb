The original title means "The birth of the octopuses". I must confess that I do not understand this title well. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing it, I read another user's comment: "The title in French is also suggestive:" prieuve ", or octopus, suggests an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously." Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear whether they are directed at the same sex or at the same time. It's no different for boys. I think both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any mix. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is the water ballet. Sometimes girls have their heads down, and nothing above water except their feet and lowers their legs, with which they will greet and kick into the air. For people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the head of a team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she would like to see when Floriane is training. This seems to be their first contact which is not just ordinary. Soon they will walk together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her, and then leaves with him for an hour, while Marie is waiting for her to return. I assumed that the couple slept with each other. But later we will learn from the film that they do less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that few users will find elsewhere. There's a scene where Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag. In it he finds an apple, mostly eaten. And Marie proceeds to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another film, "Kazetachi no gogo" (Afternoon Breezes) by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). These are young adult women, and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman. He also steals a sack of the beloved's garbage, also finds an apple more or less eaten and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Floriane later tells Marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her. Marie says she can't do it. <br /> <br /> But still later Marie says she's really willing to do it. And he masturbates on Floriane. There is no nakedness in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a director could have made such a beautiful show or psychological study? I would like to quote Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Is Floriane played by Ad√®le Haenel, who played the excellent autistic performance of "The Little Devils" by Christophe Ruggia (2002)? ? a very underrated film.
