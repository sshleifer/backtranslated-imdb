This is an excellent film with a stellar cast and a bit of acting. I never tire of watching it. I especially like the scene where the character of Danny Glover and the character of Kevin Kline, Simon and Mack, have a brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his ways are effortless and one you would often meet. So it's a very 'real' movie. <br /> <br /> One of the film's most powerful scenes, however, is at the beginning of the film when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down. The film also has a strong message and is different from the stereotypical message that carries films in which there is a person who preaches his courage to the public. Instead the emotions and situations of the actors provide an impulsive message that works best without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is as brilliant as ever.
