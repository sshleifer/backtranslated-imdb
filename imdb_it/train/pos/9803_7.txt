This Batman movie is not quite as good as the Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero. But it's still a good episode for Batman cartoons, I say it's just as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This film is good for all the same reasons. The plot is good, not really as good as the other one, but it's still pretty good it has a lot of action. The effects of cartoons are good The voice of the actors is really good as Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Forte as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The bad guys are as good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure you rent or buy Batman Mystery of The Batwoman, the movie because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ******* by ********* * <br /> <br /> *** out *****
