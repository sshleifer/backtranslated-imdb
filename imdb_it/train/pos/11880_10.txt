"Scarface" has a great following even today, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It has also been widely criticized as very gaudy, unrefined, exaggerated and inflated! These are people who compare Scarface's films with The Godfather. It is true that on the technical front (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is far behind 'The Godfather'. <br /> <br /> But it is also true, the one that has Scarface and some other gangsters are missing, it is the crudeness, the brutal approach of the gangsters. The Latin gangsters in this film seem much more threatening and real than all the clever Italian or Irish gangsters of other classic gangsters like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of Scarface's main winning points and I firmly believe that this fact has been erased as "bad taste" by most critics! I saw the original Scarface from 1932, and I must say that both of these films are too different from each other and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original on the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for being exaggerated and noisy in this film. But how about taking into consideration that it's exactly the way the directors wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is an angry young man who makes hasty decisions and launches rage attacks every minute! Here is not the calm Michael Corleone. It's Tony Montana, a very poorly educated and uneducated individual who doesn't think much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> There is definitely an 80s atmosphere in this film. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including "The theme of Gina and Elvira", "Push up to the limit" and the instrumental title track. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautifully filmed sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, Rebenga's success, the first encounter with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother. <br /> <br /> About the shows: Al Pacino is as brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. Reportedly, he enjoyed playing Tony Montana more in his entire career. And it really looks like he had a lot of fun in all his scenes! One wonders how "Scarface" would be without Pacino. I could not imagine anyone else who portrayed Tony Montana and with all odds, the film would not have been as effective without him! Steven Bauer shines as a friend of Tony Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is as wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (in the role of Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there is some fun in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is beautiful and adequate in her role. <br /> <br /> The director is a bit exaggerated during a particular part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only small part suffering due to improper treatment. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most fun and one of the best gangster movies to ever come up. Enjoy it for what it is: a crude portrait of the drug Lords and their ganglands!
