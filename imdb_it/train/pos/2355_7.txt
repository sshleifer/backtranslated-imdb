... but I liked the show anyway. I've read some of the comments previous reviewers have had to say about this show, and I'm struggling to completely erase all the criticism in my head (except one: that the show was stale, this program was EVERYTHING but stale). A lot of things that people have to do with this show is about money: pretentious; forced; overwrought; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; annoying narration always present. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, really, really TRIED; and this compensated for all the negative aspects. The show was brilliant, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and I can't wait to enjoy it. I will mourn his passage. But I believe that nobody will bring him back to life.
