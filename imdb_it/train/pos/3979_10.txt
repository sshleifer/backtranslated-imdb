I just wish all the fans of this documentary knew that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm so damn proud of him. This mini-series shown on VH1 is a great look at drug culture over the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it. The amount of time and effort I saw in this documentary and the book that started it all (Can not Find My Way Home) makes it much better to watch it on TV. I know he loves what he does and does it well. His eloquence is shown in interviews, which he himself did, and the extraordinary additions he himself adds to the comment. From music to videos and everything else, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived it. I appreciate any comments on this from those who liked (or not) and would love to hear the fans! Three applauses for Uncle Martin !!!
