The Sopranos is probably the biggest show in the history of Dramatic Television. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or top-notch performance. <br /> <br /> epic scope produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant high quality level. Centering around the life of a Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and the nuclear family of two children, the other a large group of the New Jersey Mafia, of which he is the leader of both. Played by James Gandolfini, True Romance and The Mexican Hunger, Tony is a charming, scary but also nice guy. All compliments must have been praised to Gandolfini for making a brute womanizer and horribly aggressive a real guide man. Contemporary American drama has never had such a fascinating and iconic figure as Tony. <br /> <br /> The cast of hundreds of people never boasts a flat performance and characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will remain in your memory forever. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this story, however, is the brave and revolutionary creator and writers who play a conventional drama series. Twenty one-minute sequences of dreams, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagination and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is satisfied by truly touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never gets cold or free. <br /> <br /> With TV now competitive and often poor, The Sopranos stands out as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget the redefined family. This is redesigned television.
