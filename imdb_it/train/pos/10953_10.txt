I think this show is strangely funny! It's not for everyone's taste, and I'm not going to uplift or disparage people who don't understand. I'm sure they are wonderful and brilliant people who work at different wavelengths. But if you like it, you REALLY like it. Sarah plays an infatuated car loser named "Sarah Silverman" who often finds herself in hostile situations in Homer (which is "Homer" as in "Symbolic Homer"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her short concert on Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s. I liked it immediately and did everything I could to check everything he did. <br /> <br /> This show is fun for your food and your wet pants. So I always type before looking at it and wearing adult diapers. Check it out!
