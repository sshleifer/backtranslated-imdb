Without "mental anachronism", this film that I would like to find on DVD offers an extraordinary immersion in the vital and mental context of people's thinking before the "disenchantment of the world". This, there are thirty years, a director and a screenwriter could test such an empathy and such a romantic truth to make a masterpiece leave me staggering. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine the film to better grasp it with respect to the temporal and cultural distance that allows us to lose the ability to be included / understood, analyze and finally accept this or that example of "primitive thought" ". Thought that keeps it almost impossible to feel in the secularized world, however, contains some keys to our behavior, which only future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance.If anyone knows where I can get a digital copy or VHS for me or DVD ?? Thanks in advance .
