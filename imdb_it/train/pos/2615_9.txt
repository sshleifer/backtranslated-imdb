While I was on a plane, leafing through the wide selection of films, I came across Live! almost by accident. Oh boy! what choice. <br /> <br /> I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer more than a year ago and I completely forgot that it was just waiting for another absurd movie on a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that it was a hellish race. I can't remember the last time I was so excited, terrified. I don't know if it was high altitude playing with my senses, but the suspense gradually grows through the film until it reaches a climax in which you can't get away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails Hai . <br /> <br /> First you will go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand regarding the rectitude of the show. You will depart from thinking "why the human being can be so cruel" to "why not, after all?" Ask yourself if you would. So discover the competitors, their reasons and start guessing. You will then see the competitor who pulls the trigger one by one and gets excited even if you know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good direction, with a cinematic experience that reminds you of those old movies in which I knew what would happen in the next scene but I wanted even more. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * a couple of things I would have changed: <br /> <br /> - the casting of competitors. I was really moved by the farmer and we should have looked a little more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it seemed that you didn't care about some of the competitors. While this may have been done on purpose, I think the public should have been able to associate with most of the competitors. - rules of the game, a big problem: <br /> <br /> what happens if the 5th competitor does not die when he pulls the trigger. seriously think that the last guy standing pull the trigger and execute himself !!! they should have given all the competitors a chance to live, that is: even if 5 is empty, then no one dies. <br /> <br /> I was curiously not too bothered by these negative points I enjoyed. I just wish I had popcorn with me!
