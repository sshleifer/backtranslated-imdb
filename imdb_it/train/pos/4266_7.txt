I saw it for the first time a whole life on a black and white TV in a small Samoan village and I thought it was hilarious. Now, after seeing him for the second time, much later, I don't find him hilarious. I find NOTHING hilarious anymore. But this is a witty and carefree comedy that moves quickly without tripping and I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F who is dying to get into one of the armed forces. Rub a lamp in the storage it is handling and a genius seems to give him some wishes. (I have hum, right? But although the introduction is no more than okay, the fantasies are quite vivid.) MacMurray tells the genius he wants to be in the army. Poof, and is marching along with the Washington soldiers in a particularly warm and inviting USE where June Haver and Joan Leslie wear many lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs. Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy: the German-speaking Hessians, red, not English. The Hessians are piled up in a Bierstube and sing a very funny drinking song that enhances the virtues of Vaterland, "where white wine is wetter / and Rhinier of the Rhine water / and bratwurst is sweeter / and yellow hair is more yellows / and The muleules are better / and the goose steps are more snotty. "Something like that. The characterizations are fabulous, as good as the best ones by Sig Rumann. Otto Preminger is the suspect and sinister general of Hesse. "You know, Heidelberg, the Vee are 241 against 1 against you - but the Vee are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can't go on too long with these fantasies but they are all pretty funny, and so are the lyrics. When he wants to be in the Navy, MacMurray ends with Columbus and the fantasy is presented as a great work. "Don't you know that sailing to the west meant / a terribly expensive investment? / And who do you think supplies the vehicles / but Isabella, Queen of the Queens." When they see the New World, someone observes that it looks fantastic. "I don't care how it looks," mutters Columbus, "but that place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> In any case, everything is finally straightened out, even if the genius is pretty drunk right now, and MacMurray ends up in the Marine Corps with the right girl. <br /> <br /> I made it too cute, maybe, but it's nice. Children will enjoy the puffs of smoke and magic and the banal love story. Adults will have fun with the most challenging elements of the story (who are the Hessians?) Unless they are graduates, in which case they may want to stay with the pun and say "Wow! Awesome!"
