Here's another movie from the 80s that most people simply don't know exists. This slow, picturesque (the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costner's recent "Open Range", also played by Robert Duval), and the exciting film is the perfect type of movie to watch late into the night when you can sleep or on a Sunday afternoon without words. Those in the right mood will be treated with a finely detailed and intimate look at the pain of a family and the way they come back together after the younger son accidentally shot and killed the eldest son while he was hunting. The performances are all first-rate and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their portraits, as are all support players and young actors. I particularly appreciated the way in which the director Cain (who unfortunately has not directed anything important since this except the first "Young Guns") gives us small and quiet glimpses of everyone's personal pain. We see not only how death affects the younger brother or parents, but also about the confused middle sister, the rebellious uncle, his crazy wife and the girlfriend of the dead teenager. What we basically get here is the rural Mid-Western response to "Common People". There are also the nuances of "The Straight Story" by David Lynch in some of the moral morals of the local people who portray here and also in the disturbing images of the agricultural land in which they live. This is one of the best and most realistic "tear-jerks" of the time, and a nice find for you quality movie hunters out there.
