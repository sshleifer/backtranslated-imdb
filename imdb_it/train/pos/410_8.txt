I rented this movie in DVD format without knowing anything about it, part of a winter marathon to watch a movie every night. After several horrible American action films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors struck me as an original and brilliant film. The story is meaningless, but I found the film's sincerity, goodness and total lack of irony, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, the special effects are not as technically impeccable as those produced by Hollywood, but the directors are wisely more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on steep rock spiers, a huge moon rising in front of them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess warrior crosses the skies behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. And the colors explode from one shot to another, used to express emotions rather than to represent reality. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same simplicity and immediacy of the comics characters, they do not offer great depth in themselves but refer to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically, many of the actors are surprisingly beautiful. They interpret their roles directly, without irony or cunning, and therefore are credible. <br /> <br /> The strangest of all, despite the clumsiness of the plot and the subtle characterizations, I found myself very close to tears in the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and by the wildly original vision and good heart of the movie director. <br /> <br />
