Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly expressed as a bourgeois couple who wants to build their dream house. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both are torn to pieces by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are many good laughs (even if the story is rather thin) sure to entertain the fans of the stars or the Hollywood comic style of the 1940s. A highlight is the time when a contractor undergoes a reduction in all expenses, which must have seemed rather excessive for a 1948 public. While making his exit, he assures the customer (Grant) that maybe he could get a $ 100.00 from the total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Funny!
