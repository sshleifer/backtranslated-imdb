Overall, this film is not perfect. It doesn't "hang well" together since the plot is basically a bunch of hooks for hanging jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these lines are a bit "too 80s" and tend to date the image. <br /> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that a movie has something special when you and your friends still refer to stupid quotes from it more than 2 decades later. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there are a lot of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., the skipper of Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> Also, there are some great absurd moments, like when Johnny is labeling the puppies with a price gun, or the Pope making an appearance in Johnny's neighborhood. Furthermore, the scene in which the false priest composes many words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is too loud ... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney slaughtering the English language Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne to 'play ball' Peter Boyle thinking he has lost his manhood The fake movie VD <br /> <br /> This film is not managed from home. But like "Porky's", it has enough classic comic bits to make it memorable.
