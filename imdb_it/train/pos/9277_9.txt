"Cinema is dead, long life in the cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, at last year's Romanian Anonimul film festival, now in its third edition and set in the Danube Delta. This year the award for direction went to "Offside" by Jafar Panahi. I got to see him tonight in Bucharest at the festival retrospective. The cinema is dead but still very lively. Panahi's film captivates how Iranian society appears. Digitally filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event that happened to Panahi's daughter: the problem and the risk followed one another when it was decided to participate in a soccer match. This is prohibited in Iran as we are informed. What Panahi is able to do is to make with few means, but with, probably, a lot of work, intelligence and humor the cultural models in a society that places women at a distinct level. The absurdity of the laws becomes comic. The film has a happy ending, after all because the Iranian team goes to the World Cup. What I appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this film. I would be very interested in seeing the other Panahi films that were also prohibited in Iran. I guess it can be thought of as an activist director.
