I love this movie. It is well written and performed and has good cinematography. The plot mixes action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with fantastic sets and beautiful position shots. Watch it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and Murphy in particular does a great job of portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero. I liked all the characters and found them interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I liked what happened to these people and, while the result was quite predictable (good guys win, the hero gets the extraordinarily attractive girl and the holy child saves lives - those who don't see what's coming?), it still made me happy when it all worked out in the end. Thank God the dignity of this film has never been ruined by a lousy sequel. Grab some popcorn, curl up on the couch and watch this funny, cheerful and fun movie.
