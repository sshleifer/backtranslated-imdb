this film is not pornographic, it didn't have to be pornographic, and unless my uncle is a candidate for president of the world it should never be considered a porn. <br /> <br /> Now that that problem has been solved, I can say I strongly recommend this film, as the problems are still widely available. it's fun, acting is great and raises serious (curious) questions. <br /> <br /> I can't fully understand why this movie was so abused, which is probably why I'm going to never visit us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern anti-riot movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are its main characteristics, sometimes she is angry, but we are not all?
