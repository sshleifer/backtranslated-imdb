TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the daughter of a fisherman crouched on the land of a rich man. Spirited & bold captures the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror and sudden death are what will haunt his immediate future before he can claim the sweet peace of happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming in this splendid and heartbreaking movie. She considered that Tess was her favorite role and filled him with all the spunky joy and enthusiasm that made her the world's most popular movie star for years. History has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale, with Maria the adorable and afflicted heroine besieged by all sorts of dangerous and stressful situations. The rooms are top notch, with sets of outdoor fishing villages particularly well designed. <br /> <br /> In the supporting cast, Jean Hersholt stands out as the cowardly villain who tries to force Pickford to marry him. Hersholt, a very kind soul off screen, brilliantly represents the complete moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> This was actually the second time Pickford turned TESS. A 1914 version had been one of his first major films, but his production values ​​were a bit outdated compared to the standards of the 1920s (no close-ups, for example) and Mary, producing her films and quite powerful in the 1922 to do whatever movie he wanted, he decided for the only time in his career to remake a movie. The end result is certainly up to its expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> A fascinating study for a future film researcher would be the influence of Christianity in the life of Mary Pickford; It certainly works like a golden thread through the silent films it has produced. Although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema can make these spiritual feelings seem somewhat embarrassing today, we are forced to accept them as sincere reflections, with their own repetition, of Mary's sincere beliefs. In TESS, a beautiful scene in particular stands out in this sense: Pickford is taught to read using a Bible. He tells Lloyd Hughes (who plays his sweetheart) a word close to the back of the Book that she doesn't understand. She mimics him for her (the word is obviously "crucified") and, with eyes turned towards the sky when the full meaning of the Sacrifice rises on her, Mary's face becomes positively blessed. <br /> <br /> A stunning new orchestral column for TESS was provided by Jeffrey Mark Silverman who perfectly highlights the beauty and pathos of this wonderful film.
