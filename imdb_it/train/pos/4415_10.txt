Although some may call it a "Cuban Cinema Paradise", the film is closer to How Green Was My Valley, a memory movie in mourning for lost innocence. The film cleverly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides (pro-Castro? Anti-Castro?, Focusing instead on the human fragility of the characters and the importance of the family. Full of good acting, in particular from the Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays Keitel's wife, a masterpiece full of references to classic films, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, Gael Garcia Bernal plays a marginal role, fundamental to the dramatic payoff of history: the television director Georg Stanford Brown, in a rare return in acting (remember THE ROOKIES?), he plays a homeless bum who acts like a Greek choir, superbly.It is a pity that this film, originally entitled DREAMING OF JULIA, was released in the United States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the film.
