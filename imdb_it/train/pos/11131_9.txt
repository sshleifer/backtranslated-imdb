I was looking at a list of Oscar winners and I was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as best film in 1969. After seeing it, however, I am no longer surprised. He was ahead of his time with regards to style, cinematography and the use of flashbacks to help develop the character of Joe Buck. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's short film character. I think Voight has captured the ingenuity and the wickedness-when-provoked. The two scenes that really captured me were after he gave the blowjob in the theater and when the older man urged him. I think when he looks in the mirror he is trying to figure out if he really did or is about to do something terrible. I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise it may have been typecast after the graduate. However, this is considered an all-time great for a reason.
