I've read most of the comments here. I have come to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of history. There are some who think the added narrative is weak and <br /> <br /> agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers who find themselves after the disaster and the coat stand overlooking Tony. But I don't think narration is not necessary. Like many theorists, I think our lives are narratives. We are living and realizing our autobiography. So, if we talk about our lives, this is always in the form of narration. We do not summarize facts such as: Birth, Childhood, High School etc. Let's create a story about our lives. <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with stories, we also want to put the story into a story. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand the things that happened in history when it is told in the form of a story. This is the purpose of adding a story to a documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what is happening. If I were out there, I'd be worried about me and my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point, make a successful film on it. True, it was recent to invent a great 9/11 film. However, there have been some on the subject, but none of them like this documentary. But what if there is a film in about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money since 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell the story. How many World War II movies have we seen? If I hadn't seen these films, my view of the WW would make me totally different. I remember seeing Schindlers List, and I cried for an hour during the lesson. The films give you a good image of the things that have happened in history and although it is fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and victims. <br /> <br /> So my point: telling stories is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story, and it never makes us forget what happened.
