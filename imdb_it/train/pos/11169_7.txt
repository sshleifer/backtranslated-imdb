at first I thought it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when the church dies and is brought back to life and even the caliber and its mother die and there idiot dad has to bring back life even though he announces warnings and ignores Jud.this is not Steven's best work. I thought his best job was splendor. I don't think the people who see this movie and comment on how terrible they are are wrong because they only think about what they think. as if that person could do a better job in making a horror movie. I mean making the caliber evil and how it kills Jud is brilliant. making the character more innocent and unexpected than one of the killers is beautiful. people who didn't like the movie are stupid because everything is a scary movie and none of it. don't expect something from a movie that isn't. still in a general area it was not so good. I still recommend people to watch the movie
