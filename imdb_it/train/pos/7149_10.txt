Holes is a wonderful film to see. He has good incoming messages, like: being a good friend, never giving up, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone. I still say that the book is better than the film, but the film gives the book a run for its money. Furthermore, Khleo Thomas plays Zero. This really adds to it !!!! Lol !!!
