Things to Come is a historical film. Together with Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first major science fiction shows. It is also one of the first films of doomsday. It is remarkable how filmmakers predict the start of World War II within a year, and even, subtly, the year in which it would end up in the real world. But then the film moves away from reality, painting a world devastated by war (only a substitute for poison for nuclear weapons that obviously didn't exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, making pioneering use of opaque models and paintings - later it will become the basis of the sci-fi genre. It is sad that, after the things to come, science fiction will be identified with cheap b-movies, a stereotype that does not break until 2001: A space odyssey over 30 years later. If they had remained faithful to the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play more roles in this film, with good results. Massey plays the role of "Doctor Who" as a pilot of an advanced civilization (for 1970) that seeks to conquer the population of a devastated country ruled by a simple warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). Ultimately, the plot covers 100 years. But that's a big deal with this movie - there's really not a cohesive plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such an episodic film - which somehow resembles Intolerance, actually - it is difficult to have a conventional plot, but I felt that more could have been done with the material, and even if the images in the last third of the image are really incredible and worth the admission price ... the plot is non-existent and the film itself suddenly ends just as it is becoming interesting. Perhaps the producers were thinking of another sci-fi future innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> Things to How is a movie that any serious science fiction fan should see at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, it may not withstand repeated views.
