I am a member of a canoe club and can tell you the truth that Deliverance is in tune with the tranquility and tranquility of the experience. As we put our boats in the water, the banjos echo in the back of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it philosophically affects the role of man in nature and the effect of technology on man's relationship with nature. We see it in the bow fishing. We see it in the home-made tent. There is also disdain and a feeling of superiority of the citizen towards the rural "cracker" peasant. The fact that the Atlanta banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" aims to put him on the same level as woodcutters who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle between life and death replaces the suppositories "of civilized man" on "The law". This canoe trip ends too early for the spectator, but unfortunately it is not enough for the characters.
