If you find yourself looking for an escape route, something that catches your attention for two hours and allows you to get lost in another world, Domino will satisfy this need. This is entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like the usual suspects) in which you want to see it a second time to understand it. I wondered about Domino Harvey herself, about how her life has become of interest to Hollywood. As for acting, many celebrity appearances not shown in trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who I am has done his job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume. And granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being able to care for other people.
