Well, I finally reached the "Rock 'N' Roll High School", almost 30 years after it became a midnight movie in 1979. (Later, I'll probably see this summer's new documentary for the first time "Patti Smith: Dream of Life "around 2040!" And no, the film is not dated a bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a high energy comedy that offers a lot of great music and some amazing moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, admirably played by P.J. Soles, and of the battle that she and her fellow students of Vince Lombardi High have undertaken against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies", describes Mary Woronov's performance as a "wicked Eve Arden." , that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel room monitors) and some really stimulating songs. Riff is, of course, the number 1 fan of that original punk band, the Ramones, and that band cooks a dozen of his biggest songs over the course of the film, including five in a concert that's a complete explosion. In fact, the sight of Riff dancing furiously with "adolescent Lobotomy" at this outbreak could be the funniest moment of the photo. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and then sliding down the street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do", is quite hilarious. The film ends with an explosive clash which is, I imagine, the wet dream of every high school kid. Really fun things. Incidentally, the Ramones were one of the noisiest bands I've ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD of this film has optional English subtitles for the deaf. How many old punks have found these necessary subtitles, I wonder ...
