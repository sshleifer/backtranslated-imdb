Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have heard the least about - it basically has the same principles as the second and fourth and has nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still beautiful - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a stupid fat Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series something to be reckoned with. There are even more hilarious jokes to deliver in this series, and it brings out humor in a lesser-known age - in historically accurate and fun episodes. Blackadder's third release is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but the role of Rowan Atkinson as a stupid prince's butler is fun and well done, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very good! 9/10
