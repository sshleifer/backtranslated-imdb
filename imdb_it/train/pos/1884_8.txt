This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not wanting to forgive his hero's uninspiring lifestyle, but taken for what it's worth and not to trivialize alcoholism, the film is simply very funny. It tells the unlikely tale of an inveterate, irresponsible and perennial bachelor named Arthur who will inherit a great fortune, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks he can do something about him. Arthur proposes, but then falls in love involuntarily with Linda, a maid and a petty thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most captivating drunk in the world, whose antics are a laugh at the minute. Sure, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can't imagine any other actor in the role. Even the women of the piece are well represented. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and her on-screen chemistry with Moore is fantastic. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the richest and most appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film was literally made by Sir John Gielgud, who portrays the sarcastic but moralistic butler of Arthur, Hobson. It is obvious that these two had great mutual affection during Hobson's long-standing work. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and supplier of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's love story at all, but his unusual relationship with this witty servant and, of course, perpetually disapproving. It is the butler that you will remember best after the launch of the credits.
