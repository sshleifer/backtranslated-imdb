A young London lawyer, Arthur Kidd is sent to a small coastal town of Crythin Gifford to monitor the estate of a recently disappeared widow, Mrs Drablow. While attending his funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black attracts her attention. Presumably Drablow lived a solitary life, and the locals were quite silent about her. Then he heads for Mrs. Drablow's mansion which can only be reached on a causeway across the swamp during low tide. There he meets the black woman in the cemetery at the back of the house again, and things start to get scary when terrifying swamp sounds start coming. Now Mrs. Drablow's properties and listening to her dairy houses help Kidd understand this dark mystery that the locals are afraid to talk about. <br /> <br /> Often considered among the horror fans as one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and I can see their point. But only in doses does it get the tag. Yes, from what you can pick up I was a bit upside down, although I really liked it. I was expecting goosebumps for the whole function, but probably it is ?? waiting for. Mostly I had a similar reaction with the 1980 ghost house thriller "The Changeling". When you listen to so many good things, sometimes it's hard not to get involved. <br /> <br /> However, what the British television presentation of "The Woman in Black" does effectively is to bring out a real old fashion, to slowly burn down the thorny premises driven by its moody positions, with a disturbing atmosphere and of first-class performance. Subtly wraps the psychologically engaging plot (adapted from Susan Hill's novel of the same name), since the simple mystery opens authentically with a sadly depressing tone and successfully characterizes its protagonist. Little seems to happen, and may feel pulled out, but the fragile randomness takes you by surprise. Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black. Who appears mostly as a background figure, is ultimately disturbing. It might not seem so much, but when does it ?? Talk about unnerving! This also applies to the unexpected conclusion. Pauline Moran, who plays the woman in black, makes us nervous only by her gaunt appearance and by her sudden positioning. A pale appearance and those minor mannerisms seem to haunt you. It is a spirit that you don't want to meet with, but just let it see you. A performance performed by a wonderful lunatic Adrian Rawlins while attorney Arthur Kidd holds everything together. In support there are the solid turns of Bernard Hepton, David Daker, Clare Holman and David Ryall. <br /> <br /> Drawing heavily on its lush rural city and the misty coastal shores adds more to realistically disturbing sadness and the central piece was everything takes place in the desolate and Victorian Victorian house that chokes the air with constant fear. Director Herbert Wise carefully builds alarming images that slowly cover a secret piece at a time in a smooth rhythm of a harmonious arrangement. Instead of going out to shock us, some scenes contain a painful intensity that will not let go. The sound effects are masterfully used, surrounding and disorienting the air. Rachel Portman's heartbreaking musical score knows how to get under the skin during those disturbing moments and then stay with you. <br /> <br /> This feat created for television is a stimulating and upsetting supernatural phantom. He may not share much with the subgenus again, but he competently abides by the strengths to offer what counts in this curse.
