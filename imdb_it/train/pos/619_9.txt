I anticipated this film to be decent and possibly clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him until now) played a very talented man; he was so serious and romantic, me and my friend who saw the movie with me totally in love with him. Claire Danes, who liked me first (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me like her even more Her acting was fantastic, I couldn't even say she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was pretty perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well founded; DeNiro like that gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so hard in that scene where Septimus arrives on the ship ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked it like the cheeky mother in Hairspray. But he had the right amount of melodrama and malicious comments in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was fun (but not at all crappy!), romantic, the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were, they were fantastic; even the cameos of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were well placed. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy films like the Princess Bride or even the Lord of the Rings. He kept my interest all the time and I will buy the DVD when it comes out!
