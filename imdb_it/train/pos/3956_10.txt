HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The new culinary scene of the film at the beginning of the film is great. Minions are always fun when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of cooking, we cut the original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that they fit into the new story. They do an introduction if the old plot doesn't match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I won't give it to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars.
