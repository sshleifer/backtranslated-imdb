I admit to having created great expectations before looking at why some friends mentioned it (and they are not perverts!) As a must see. And it's a must see! Don't expect to see something shocking. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there is only too much perversion and in the end it does not stick. <br /> <br /> Some of the positive things are Kieslowski's Blue analysis, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock's and maybe another pair I lost (I just remembered ... Dogville), and usually I don't miss things unless they are too obvious or free in the air. <br /> <br /> Besides being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is fun in the sense of noticing some perversions fueled by our unconscious, from which the commercial success of most of the thrillers has studied and used as a basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narrative and Mr. Zizek's effort to revive Freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, especially in North America. Once again, it's a way over the top and I don't think it's a waste of time because I believe that many humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
