I like my charming and casual Ronald Colman, the type you see in films like If I Were King and Kismet. I like the epitome of civilization like in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A grim Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in A Double Life just because his role as actor Anthony John is so unusual for him, Colman was awarded an Oscar for best actor in 1947. he became his best known part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who takes the Method very seriously. He has just finished a successful run in a comedy of good manners and is a very jovial type. For a change of pace now that that comedy ended its run on Broadway, Colman is bringing a renaissance of Othello to New York. About the opposite part you can get. <br /> <br /> His protagonist in both is his ex-wife Signe Hasso who loves him very much, but cannot stand his change of mood when he is at work. Colman loves her too and wants her back. But he is facing a mental breakdown when he starts to get confused with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with his role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Shelley Winters is a poor waitress that a depressed Colman makes fun of her madness and she ends up like poor Desdemona in the drama. Killed the same way and now it's a matter for the murder cop Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Is Colman's performance so good that one is surprised if this is a professional risk with the actors? I would have shuddered to think so, there were unsolved murders in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, then they tested Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never buy the story for this reason, but I certainly applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part. I'm sure there was a bit of regret for winning the Oscar, also because one of the other candidates was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others in that season were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman gets support from the rest of the cast including Edmond O 'Brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. You still won't find an Iago equivalent in A Double Life, no one will attract jealousy, it's all in his mind. <br /> <br /> And that of one of the most cultured and civilized minds of the last century.
