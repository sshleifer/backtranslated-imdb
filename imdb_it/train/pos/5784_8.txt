I noticed a lot of people posting on "Kerching!" advice seems to hate this show, which in reality I find very surprising. I think it's one of the best shows for English kids there is. It is a pity that it ends because it is very funny (even if it is a bit of cheese sometimes) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, though much smarter. With his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mother by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who has a simple mentality and the character of comic relief). During the show, some characters left and new ones came out, but it was always fun and improving.
