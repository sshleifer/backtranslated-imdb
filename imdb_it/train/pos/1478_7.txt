I liked this movie, even though halfway, I was able to tell who was the secret admirer. I'm also wondering if it was based on a true story as it told people "real" at the end of the film. I guess I'll have to look for it and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember what happened? I think they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course states could have been changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You would think that this man could have understood it as easily as I did. Was it stupid or what?
