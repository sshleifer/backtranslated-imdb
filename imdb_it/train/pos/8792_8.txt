An amusing kung fu film, with recitation, plot and fight scenes, a cut above the average chop. All the casts are cute characters and skilled martial artists. The antics of Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy are fun to watch, and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the only glaring flaw in the film is the size of the cast: sometimes things get confused when the movie breaks and changes between the various subplots, and some of the characters aren't as complete as you might want. <br /> <br /> But a kung fu movie should be judged first of all on the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple certainly delivers that result. The film culminates in a high-bodied battle that allows each character to show his skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, Shaolin Temple is a fun low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but it's definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous Notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video version I saw was (predictably) little known, and lacked all the credits of the cast and crew.
