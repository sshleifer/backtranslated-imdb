I have to warn you, there are some spoilers. But to start, I got "Spanish judges" in February, I think. It was said that it was the last copy, but as I have seen, it was not rearranged. But in both cases, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see it mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one in the reviews mentions the scar) even though it's a bit of a low budget, getting enough money to make this movie worth it. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a scammer known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have merchandise called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what the Spanish judges are or if you haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you've read, I won't even say what I am. I guess it would be a big break in which nobody knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who is also a scammer, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) and a scammer named Piece (Mark Boone Junior). She has a girl who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, as you said. So they (mainly Jack) call it "Mars Girl". Everything starts well, but then turns into a big game. A game that involves a bit of lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of acting (Matt and Valeria, like Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes that could have done better and the score could have been a little better. Some of the scores were actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the end credits) was a good musical choice, this is my opinion. The fighting scene could have been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? Another comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a cool scammer. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction to NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been acting since 1983. For me, and I hope, for others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both "Hot Shots!" movie. But a good review. <br /> <br /> Even though I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (that's why I gave 10 stars above), I'll vote for what I thought when I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
