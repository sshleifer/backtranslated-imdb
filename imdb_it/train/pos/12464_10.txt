Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - what more could you ask for? Monkey Grip, based on the award-winning novel of the same name, explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother who falls in love with a heroin addict Jobe (Friels). A simple story is made truly extraordinary through the magnificent all-round acting (in particular Noni Hazlehurst ) and good use of the small budget. The only flaw is (if you can take it) is that the story is set in Melbourne, although for budgetary reasons, the film was shot mainly in Sydney, and consequently, in some scenes see the trams (scenes from Melbourne) and then a post office in Carlton (scenes from Sydney). Apart from that, "Monkey Grip" is a must see (sorry for the clique, but it is) at least for an award-winning interpretation of the former "Play" School Presenter "and" Better Homes & Gardens "Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
