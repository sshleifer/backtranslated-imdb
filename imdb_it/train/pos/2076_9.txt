The Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone must see ... It is a tearful tear and a lot of heat. It addresses the valorisation of values: training on perseverance, humility and love for the family ... History can be related to our life today, especially because poverty is on the threshold. The way in which we respond to this problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to deal with it, he could remain defenseless and useless. I am very happy with how the characters have justified their roles even the young actors ... Their emotions have fascinated the public. The film may have been done in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you don't want to end it. This makes it really great! There should be a re-make for this very beautiful film.
