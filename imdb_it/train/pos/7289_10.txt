This was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about 5 years old at the time. It scared me OK! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother got very angry. He had to clean my eyes with alcohol and the next day my eye had the smell of DOUBLE MINT! NOW THAT IS A FILM! Hey, it's a great movie for now. That Head sitting on the lab shelf was as real as it was then. AND IF YOUR 5 IS VERY SCARY! Children now one day are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave NOTHING for the imagination of your mind. Your mind can imagine scarier things than special effects! (IMO)
