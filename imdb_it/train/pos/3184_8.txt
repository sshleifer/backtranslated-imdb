This Hong Kong filmed potrobiator contains more melodrama than the week of "The Young & The Restless". This is more of a return to the original trilogy "Emmanuelle" (in particular "Goodbye Emmanuelle") than to a sleazefest D'Amato. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) undergoes a stunning transformation from a nurse to a hot-to-trot trampoline. The future Italian porn / political star, Illona Staller, who will later be called Ciccolina (and will have sex with an HIV positive John Holmes) will play the Emy competition. Exotic venues and some decent soft-core scenes complete this. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
