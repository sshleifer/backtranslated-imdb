Actually, I never bought metal that was satanic and stuff like that, but this kind of movie played on that idea. While it certainly isn't a film to be taken seriously or to be valued really high, it serves its purpose as it entertains while it plays. The story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream in this sense and said that the band starts bingeing over the grave. So yes, a bit of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" plot going on here. Grant Freddy has never harassed a girl in a car before. There was another movie with a heavy metal band, but it was very different in the way it was played because it had a band that took over a city of children and drove them crazy. This simply has the only fan of the band that initially helps the killer spirit and then tries to stop it. Nothing creepy as I don't remember everything that kills many crimes. Frankly, the scene that I remember most is the scene of the girl wearing headphones and being harassed by some incarnation of the band. Nothing exceptional, but a good time filling.
