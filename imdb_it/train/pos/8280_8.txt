George and Kim travel with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and deviates into a ditch. But what appears to be a simple event of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey, where myth becomes reality and a carnivorous spirit, half animal and half Wendigo man, persecutes a small town ... a horror film that scares thought, which often turns into a sad family drama. The acting is great, the characters are well developed and there are some creepy moments. The subtle views of Wendigo are effectively managed and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story takes place entirely in the mind of Miles. "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and it certainly won't be the last. Give this film a chance, if you don't mind looking at something unconventional.8 out of 10.
