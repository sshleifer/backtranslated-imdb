It is a pity that Deliverance is mainly known as the rape film on the red neck and for Dueling Banjos. Even the people who saw the movie can't get their minds off that rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's not as bad as any female rape scene in almost any movie. People tend to lose the power of the movie that contains the infamous rocking scene. <br /> <br /> The acting, the plot, the cinematography and the soundtrack of Deliverance lend a hand to his charisma. The backcountry in which it was shot is beautiful and is in stark contrast to the obscure subject. Both major and minor actors make you feel like you're rafting along that river. <br /> <br /> The thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of terror it inspires. Not many films can make you feel uncomfortable. Bottom Line: this film is a classic. I can't really say much more.
