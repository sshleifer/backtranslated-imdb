Believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this film (for 1912) is a feature film. Very few films were longer then, but this is NOT what distinguishes this strange little film from the rest! No, what is different is that all the actors (except for a frog) are insects ... yes, bugs! This simple domestic comedy could very much resemble productions with actors like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that look like bugs). Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy still had to be discovered and I assume that Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used the bugs! Using stop-motion, the insects moved, danced and fought incredibly well - and a devil much more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Mr. Beetle having fun enjoying himself. He goes to a shady club while his wife waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he is captured by a fan of local cinema. Also, he doesn't know, but Ms. Beetle is also carrying out a bohemian painter. Of course, there is much more to this domestic comedy, but the plot is ancient and very fun for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Strangely but also very surprising and watchable.
