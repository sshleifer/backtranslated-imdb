Much has been written about the plot of the film, the wonderful acting, the script, the melancholy, the bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can I add? Just look at one of the most touching, beautifully played and touching scenes that have ever been shot. It's Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (the shop owner - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his failed marriage and a suicide attempt. While each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them politely refuses it. They all have a plan for their Christmas Eve. At this stage there is a deep sadness for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the interpretation of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. Fortunately we have a happy ending in this very special scene. The new clerk, the bellboy, is the last to leave the shop in a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately Mr. Matuschek approaches this guy and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him, he will treat him of all the wonderful Christmas food that this deliveryman probably never saw! The guy is overwhelmed, he is obviously as lonely as Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas lunch. Every time I see this scene it moves me. If you can get the delightful DVD by watching the great trailer with Frank Morgan showing up as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance by the film's director - the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This film is a joy from beginning to end.
