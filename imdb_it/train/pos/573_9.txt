I have always appreciated films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring areas, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this film (and the novel by Norman Maclean). Life flows and flows like a river, and has its ruins, but it's a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His narration has a friendly feeling that fits the image perfectly. As a director, he is sober and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I don't know how to describe the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, except that they really feel real. "A River Runs Through It" is a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
