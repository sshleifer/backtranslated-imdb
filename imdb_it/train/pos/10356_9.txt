In August 1980, the disappearance of little Azaria Chamberlain and the trial of her parents, Lindy and Michael, for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar in what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already tried and convicted the couple of defendants and were looking for blood. What followed was a very big judicial error. Michael and Lindy Chamberlain argued that while camping near Ayers Rock in central Australia, a dingo had taken their ten-week-old daughter from their tent while they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area. No one believed them. Lindy was accused of murdering her baby and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The whole country was abuzz with the whispers of a ritual murder. Chamberlain's trial was over before it started. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was influenced by media and media pressure. How could we, as a nation, sit in judgment? Where are we from, how could we presume to know? Unless there was absolute proof, and without any reasonable doubt, the Chamberlain should have been acquitted. <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi's film unequivocally and completely supports the thesis of John Bryson's novel, according to which the Chamberlain were completely innocent accusations against them. In fact, a dingo brought little Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a bloodthirsty nation, the hell bent on the "truth" that is brought to light. Show Australia in a somewhat unbecoming light as a people totally obsessed with seeing Chamberlain pay! His screenplay, co-written with Robert Caswell, vigorously evokes emotions and will surely find the audience saddened and irritated by the disguise of justice that has occurred. <br /> <br /> The exceptional Meryl Streep offers an incredible performance as a woman accused of the most terrible of acts. Brings the small and tender Australian to life in a more convincing way that was ready to resist accusations and set the world. Even his accent is almost, but not quite, perfect. An excellent effort on the part of the owner of that trade. Sam Neill is just as good as Streep as the first faithful, but then disillusioned Michael who fails to understand why their world is falling apart, and begins to question his Christianity. His, like Streep's, is a demonstration of great emotional strength that will move you deeply. The entire supporting cast is also excellent, with some of the best Australian actors and actresses playing a part. <br /> <br /> The film is also brilliant, with cinematographer Ian Baker capturing this beautiful land with splendor (especially Rock). The publisher Jill Bilcock keeps the whole film tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton gives a significant score. <br /> <br /> For all Australians this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you want it, what we as a nation did to a family that only wanted to be justice and that the truth was known . As Michael Chamberlain said: "I don't think anyone really understands what innocence means ... for innocent people." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even in the return views, Fred Schepisi's story about the parody of justice that hit the Chamberlain, who lost little Azaria in rock of Ayres in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honest. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred the John Bryson novel to the screen, simply telling the horrible story of a terribly bad holiday for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new daughter Azaria was taken from the family tent by a dingo a few moments after being put down. > <br /> Between media speculation and vicious public voices, Lindy was accused of murdering her child, and Michael was accused as an accessory after the fact. What followed was little more than a trial by the media, and with the Australian population determined to postpone it, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with forced labor, although the prosecution could present no reason and little more circumstantial evidence. br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is in very good shape as the accused woman who fights against Australia to prove her innocence. She's really fantastic, and the only thing she misses is a real Australian blue accent, even if she does her best to look like a girl. You might ask yourself why a great Australian actress was not chosen to play the role, but the star power is probably the answer. Besides Meryl, Sam Neill is just as impressive, as exceptional as the husband who sees his world crumble before his eyes, while feeling powerless to do something about it. A strong cast of Aussie provides irresistible support. <br /> <br /> Editing by Jill Bilcock is very current, the cinematography of Rock and other rugged places by Ian Baker is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Really a must for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
