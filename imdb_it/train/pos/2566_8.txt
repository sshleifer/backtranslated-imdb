Any film that has to do with bigotry in a positive way is a film that has yet to be seen by the current public because the message and the moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story ... boy meets girl ... boys lose girl ... boy returns girl .... <br / > <br /> The weakest role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lieutenant General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is a close second) ... my question would be why he became a 3-star general ... the character it is such a lousy in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it is a wonder that they show him a minimum of respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit exaggerated, and some scenes have some holes, but overall, I like the movie every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red Buttons is great ... I love to see comedians in dramatic roles ... as in the case of Button, often a comedian can better represent the tragedy of a person than a more traditional actor.
