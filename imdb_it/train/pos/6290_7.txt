Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him the chance to showcase those talents in a short history of time travel. He falls in love with a boy who lives in modern times, and it becomes obvious that we are better left to our times. Keaton is able to do his gags very well. I heard his voice before. I think he made some of those Beach Party movies, playing vague characters just to earn some money. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. It's not a bad story. Show how it reacts when we want something we don't have and get that desire.
