A bit typical of the cinema of this era. Obviously, it was conceived for the first time in this world for the stage, but still a great film from beginning to end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York perform theatrical performances for the big screen and both do it effectively. There is very little in terms of history and anyone not familiar with this kind of off-beat study might be a little discouraged by it. All in all, however, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York come to reckon.
