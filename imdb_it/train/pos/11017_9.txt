This film was intended to be better than the average action film and, in this respect, it succeeded. This film had a spectacular cinematography with spectacular snowy peaks and heights, a very fit Stallone who also performed a good performance, an exciting storyline and a great performance by his main villain because he will really surprise you with his bad ways. The film is not great for the big screen. The plot and the story cry for this film to make Stallone a special human being, very similar to the characters in the Rambo or Rocky or Bond films. They chose to highlight the character of Stallone in this, but considering the style of the plot, it weakens the excitement factor. Moreover, the dialogue has been vulgar and careless at times. The script should have been more realistic and less "talking". Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes. Film producers should have been more careful about how they did the shots and the missions. The quality of the shooting sequence scenes during the aerial hijacking at the beginning of the film should be continued. Instead, they decided to shoot down a lot of shooting sequences ("A-Team" TV series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain. This film has had a lot of potential for all times. Salvator's action sequences, Stallone's best dialogue and Rambo / Rocky emotion / determination would take this film to a higher level. I know this was not Stallone's fault. the director of the film wanted to deny the character of Stallone and try to steal the film by taking credit for his direction which was not so exceptional had it not been for his director of photography. A good movie though ........
