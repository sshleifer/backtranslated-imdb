I'm obsessed! The story is incredible and the show is very compelling, but I love it. I'm in season two, record 5, and I tell you I'm too attached to the characters now. For something bad to happen to them it would have seriously affected my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. I'm kidding ... I'm so happy to see that there is a season 3, because I was too scared to go to Disc 6 thinking it would end. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / and actors of Lost ... I like watching TV again. Before Lost I sailed on every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment on television, but I must say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
