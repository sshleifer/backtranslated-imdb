Gentleman Jim is another legendary case in the press, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a hilarious entertainment that barely stops. It is useless to look for historical accuracy here as in Flynn's Light Charge Brigade - it's a real hokum with all the stops taken out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a sense of real energy by the vivid direction of Raoul Walsh. Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you would never imagine he had a mild heart attack during production), with Alexis Smith, a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual companion Alan Hale together, this time as Flynn's father ( This time Jack Carson has secondary tasks). In fact, even the pirate galleon of the previous Flynn movies creates a cameo a bit out of place in a port encounter! The 103 minutes just touch.
