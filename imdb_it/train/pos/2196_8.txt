... so what is there in those 10 minutes missing so horrible that you have to cut them out of the original film? We had three years in the production code of the film ... Barbara Stanwyck had acted in the original comedy, but here Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably the best known for "Double Indemnity", with Stanwyck, as well as his famous television program "My Three Sons". Keep an eye on a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope's film) and the too fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who has enriched almost every recorded video. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever jokes at the beginning. She from Maggie is played by Jean Dixon, who was "Holiday's" best friend and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", Maggie the tourist meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie loses her boat when she leaves the harbor and tangles with the soldier. Quinn, a great film, has a small scene in the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) played the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid play together and try to figure out how to get back to the United States. Some good Lamour singing. Good (but short) acting interpretation of Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", the wise and helpful owner of the local Panama salon. While others have complained about how bad it is, it wasn't so horrible, and it's even a bit exotic, with the false setting of Central America for the first half of the movie.
