If you read Mother Night and had so much fun (as I did) that you just have to watch the film, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whit and humor cannot simply be transcribed from a screenplay or even the best acting. I believe this film overcomes the key questions that Vonnegut puts in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not on the screen. Does this mean that the film misses the mark? Obviously not. In my opinion, the film is successful because it does not attempt to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a means for those who are too lazy to turn a page). It happens because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in an unpretentious framework. I have seen other film versions of Vonnegut's books in which the director obviously tries to channel the genius of Vonnegut and loses his grip on his own art. I would not put this film as one of the best I've ever seen, but it stands on its legs as if it was worth it. Taking the "voice" of Vonnegut from the narration of the film or trying to insert it anyway, Mother Night tells her story in a brilliant way and preserves the fundamental lessons of history without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
