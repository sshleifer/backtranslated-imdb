Now I've seen this about 10 times, so there must be something I like! <br /> <br /> The science fiction films of the fifties were practically a mixed group: they were made intelligently and / or stimulating or cheap and laughable cheese. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for genre, color. <br /> <br /> He also had an advantage with the script - even though Shakespeare might not have recognized it, it was based on his timeless play and therefore guaranteed a certain longevity if done well. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a man who was artificially artificially enlarged by machines, a dead race that remained active 200,000 years before. Along the way the plot is bristling with 50s stereotypes and corn so pure that you ask yourself sometimes why you're looking at it, but you always do it. That love triangle thing ... eh! The Disney cartoon still holds up well, and the cartoon backgrounds straight from the covers of the Galaxy magazine etc. They look beautiful even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car in the desert in the distance is a blast! <br /> <br /> All in all, with all the flaws, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives.
