Fido is a very strange film. And in many ways, a very good one. <br /> <br /> My first thought after seeing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story blends with the nostalgic comedy of the fifties with zombies. It doesn't literally explode the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has some of Shaun's carnage, gore and laughter. It's a completely different beast (forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido starts with a black and white film that explains the story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subjugates meat eaters in stupid servants. At first I thought we were in a paranoid parody of the Cold War of the Fifties at the Matinee, but we are soon thrown into a world of bright primary colors and mid-fifties -class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely boy who doesn't fit in school. His mother is an aspiring social climber, and his father is nervous and detached. <br /> <br /> Trying to keep up with the Joneses, the mother (Carry-Anne Moss) acquired a zombie. At first Jimmy is uninterested, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) soon turns out to be a great friend for Jimmy. Until his collar stops ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the film is to understand exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor is of the light variety of the family, and sometimes the plot is too dependent on the boy and his dog / family moments. <br /> <br /> However the film is crossed by wonderfully dark moments, really funny, that while welcome, will guarantee an R rating for what is, for long periods, a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The film looks wonderful, and it is wonderfully played by everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Despite its difficult tone problems, I hope this film finds a niche, as it is a real gem in this year's movie flood.
