It is sad to see this film now that we know how the ANC has been dominated by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing. Woods has achieved little. Yes, the complete apartheid was abolished, but all the apparatuses of power were reserved by the minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less powerless. As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine, in the black and white leadership talks "the deKlerk government had a two-pronged strategy: first, relying on Washington's Ascendant Consensus that there was no single way to manage a economy, represented key sectors of economic decision-making - such as trade policy and the central bank - as "technical" or "administrative". Then it used a wide range of new political tools --- international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to pass control of those centers of power to apparently impartial experts, economists and officials from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party --- anyone except the liberation fighters of the ANC. "The statistical results are horrible, with few changes made and Aids flourishing. Seeing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic. The ANC has turned from being the solution to being the main problem.
