I really liked the performances of the main cast. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed shows in which the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with the change between the ages. The background story of unions that lose power and the effect of a large employer closing in a small town is also appreciated. I disagree with the comment that the older man should be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being handsome. The depth of character can be attractive for the not so superficial. The film looks good and the photography is also good.
