The film is a bit split from the beginning, Eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness on stage and makes the simplest thing fun of having a child's ice cream in the long family tradition. The film is very rare in this country but it is not sure of the availability in other countries, I have searched through many websites and still without luck, I have phoned companies looking for rare videos and there are annual waiting lists for this. THEREFORE SUGGESTIONS ARE VERY WELCOME. If someone likes Eddie Murphy in the role of a comedian and you see the video, take it, it's worth it and you can't go wrong.
