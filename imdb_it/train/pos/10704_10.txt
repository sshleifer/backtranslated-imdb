Are you a giraffe? ... ask John about Nadia, and she, sure to respond well, answers him: yes. In this way, communication begins between a man and a woman who do not know each other and, at the same time, questions and doubts in "Birthday Girl". A film that I have heard many times, but I dare not see ... up to two hours of writing this. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is a passionate film that makes me fall into the count, at the same time, Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (besides being nice and smart) I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and routine man looking for a wife on the Internet. The woman she finds comes from Russia. It seems to be that delicate, normal woman, no more. One day, on his birthday, his cousin and his friend suddenly arrive. Man, start to discover certain things. From that moment, he will not be the lonely and routine man he has always been. <br /> <br /> Many of us will think that this film is just a normal with an exploited plot. Many of us will think that the action and the thrill are safe and not novel. But "Birthday Girl" is just the opposite. This film is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative plot that I had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with a certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with many proposals for films of this genre. "Birthday Girl" has a certain beauty and crudeness in her scenes, but at the same time, a certain moving nature, and makes it so deeper. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end, it's totally satisfying. And I don't mind saying that this is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if there are any.
