The first collaboration between Schoedsack and Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe to Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to reach the pasture. You will feel like a weak pamper after seeing these people gather their animals through icy water and walk barefoot in the snow to cross the mountains as they try to make their animals walk along steep and narrow paths.
