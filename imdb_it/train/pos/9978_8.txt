I must say that I loved Vanishing Point. I've seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. Although he didn't follow the original storyline (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline. <br /> <br /> As for the car, well, DJ's comment at the end about the Challenger that goes at 185 mph in the bulldozers is rather unlikely (And if you look, the tachometer needle ranged to 145-150), but even if I didn't see one on the engine in one of the early scenes showing the engine, the original plot had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics would not allow it, today's normally aspirated Chrysler 300C can reach 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it is like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Furthermore, in a wind tunnel test, if you put an air dam on the Challenger, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
