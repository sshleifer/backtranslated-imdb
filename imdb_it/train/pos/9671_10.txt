Paulie is a fantasy of a smaller girl or perhaps his memory of how his youth was. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs an impeccable performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who cannot find a decent job in America. He befriends an isolated parrot while carrying out the petty duties of a janitor in a behavioral science lab. <br /> <br /> The chief doctor is a bitter man, like Paulie, who can speak and fully understand the language and learn, embarrasses the doctor, who later banishes him to the lower floors of the building, where he finds Mikail ( Tony S.). <br /> <br /> Paulie finds his life with Marie and how they got lost. The research begins to bring Paulie together with Marie, only more than 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The film ends, some will predictably say, with Mikail rejoining Paulie with Marie. The story ends with the three entering Marie's home, where you can make the final of your choice. <br /> <br /> Great family film!
