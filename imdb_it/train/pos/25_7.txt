I never saw this when I was a child, so this was seen with new eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter. Also, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious. The special fx are poor and the singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was enchanted. I loved watching Walken in this role thinking about what the future would hold for him. Very fun to watch him dance! And if the songs weren't great, at least they weren't Disney's overwhelming sweetness. The orc scene at first was a little scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw it again at the end, but it was mostly benevolent. It is interesting to note that we recently read "Puss in Boots" and asked myself the implausibility of the story. But while remaining faithful to almost every aspect, Walken's acting made him credible. Great fun. I would watch it again with my daughter.
