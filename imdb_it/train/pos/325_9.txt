This is a great film - esp when compared with the sometimes tiring seriousness of today's politically oriented filmmakers. A film that can so easily combine sex, gender, politics and art is a rarity these days. While the bouyant optimism of the 1960s cannot be regained, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the energy and sparkling appeal of the film. I don't know what those who label the film "boring" were looking at - there is so much space in it that the same film never remains for more than 15 minutes at a time.
