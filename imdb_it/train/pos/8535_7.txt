This work is a bold look at the mentality of men in a wheelchair. This film never tries to dampen the anguish, confusion and pain of what these kids live with. This is his strength, I think. <br /> <br /> But above all, the performances are fantastic, with a well conceived and delivered dialogue, which involves you and makes you feel part of the experience. The characters never try to stop the public from knowing what they think - what's in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it tiring, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The score is 6.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
