Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. He has no problem watching naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, it's when he loses them. He believes that when women have sex it is when they lose the sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks around the Hollywood Hills watching the loving couples from a distance, killing the men with a high-powered rifle with a telescope. <br /> <br /> The apparent main reason for the existence of this film is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again. The "story" comes out more as an afterthought. This is meant to make many happy and heterosexual men happy while we deal with fairly prolonged nudity scenes (women here seem to be awfully good sans) and sex as an important titillation dose. Obviously, seeing a good result through a goal greatly increases the chills factor and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism. (First, Mike looks at the couples through the viewfinder for minutes at a time before pulling the trigger.) All of this is underlined by a strangely intrusive music if somewhat suggestive on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those who have the inclination for filthy garbage are bound to enjoy it in one way or another. It even includes a lesbian tryst that confuses Mike and makes him uncertain * how * to react. It takes place at a very slow pace, but wraps with a very funny ironic touch. It is an extravagant and twisted rarity that if nothing else will surely keep some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
