A fabulous film. With everything you could want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and many other actions. Suspense and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> A bit like an old hood film. Completely fun from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Assembly was quick and you're never bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal family. The actors are beautiful and the scenery beautiful. The costumes are spectacular and the work of the stunts is imaginative. Even the special effects are fantastic. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really awesome as an actor and a great look. Seems like a safe bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as usual. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the protagonist, even making a British accent with considerable success. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the film has won numerous awards, and I can understand why. <br /> <br /> All in all it is an independent film. See for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give a TEN + !!!
