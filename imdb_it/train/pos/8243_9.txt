In a succession of the fifties, in which an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious "space dust") was contained through the use of special electronic collars, a solitary young man, Timmy, finds a friend of Fido (Billy Connelly ), his domestic zombie recently acquired by the family. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real father is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or his hot-to-trot wife, played by the beautiful Carrie- Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when she was forced to shoot her father, who tried to eat it!). Timmy runs into a spot of annoyance, however, when his putrid friend's collar continues to flash, and attacks and kills an elderly neighbor. With authorities on Fido's trail, problems with a couple of local bullies and his mother bonding with their undead domestic help, will Timmy be able to keep his new friend? <br /> <br /> A refreshing version of all the zombie schtick, Fido is a completely funny and delightfully dark comedy that should interest anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into the small city of the fifties in America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to deal with the whole theme of the "reanimated dead" I saw. <br /> <br /> Connelly's Fido is a movie zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead's Bub and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; I don't often feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin's performance is so beautiful that I found myself rooting for the big blue pus bag! Does the rest of the cast also offer laudable performances, with the young K'Sun Ray (like Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentions ?? Ray, because, for such a young man, he makes a particularly safe turn, and Moss because she is so damn tasty! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I saw this week (the others are the slightly disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead) and, to my surprise, it's also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given genre fans something truly original to be valued and is a talent to watch in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
