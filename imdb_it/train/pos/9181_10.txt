I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before seeing this miniseries. I had read and watched many classics before, and believed that most of the classics were boring, extravagant and overvalued stories with moderately interesting plots at best. This Jane Eyre miniseries has completely changed my ideas. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress and offers a wonderful interpretation of Jane Eyre. Her accent is delightful and her quiet but firm nature corresponds exactly to the character of the young governess. Timothy Dalton is a magnificent Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me think he was born to play the meditative role of Thornfield Hall. I couldn't sleep at all at night after seeing this miniseries. The plot is both disturbing and stimulating. The characters are masterfully executed and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre to appear in the film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was surprised by how this mini-series followed the writing of Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, check out the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.
