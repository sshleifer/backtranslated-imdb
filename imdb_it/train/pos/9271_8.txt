This is what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is football a metaphor for a game of qualification between girls (or more generally, a free-thinking group) and authority? Does "in Germany" mean for a future that is hopeful? <br /> <br /> It is one of the most unforgettable cinematic experiences I have ever had - despite the cinematography and the raw plot, and the slight over-acting (although I like the cast - they are lovely and well above the 'expectation for amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the deep frustration denied to a game (being a woman and a football fan) and I can't stop thinking about how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there isn't a women's section where protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided - defeating the vicious reasons to deny. <br /> <br /> The film is very skilfully made - the fantastic title, the in-game filming, the spontaneity and various methods to put the spectators in the characters' shoes - the game that is so important but inaccessible (not shown ), the captivating light and the cheering from the stadium, the confinement of the van, and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the crowd that celebrates outside. I can feel the comfort that comes from the radio, from drinks and food and, of course, from the kindness and consideration of each character to others. During the credits, I am amused by the fact that no character has a name: he is just a "soldier" and is any "girl" or "sister".
