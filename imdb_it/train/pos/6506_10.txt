Absolutely brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most compelling documentary series ever made about war. The tone offers a stark contrast to the often enthusiastic attitude towards the Second World War that the media exhibit. Instead of opting for the screams of the horror of war, it allows the quiet voice of Sir Laurence Olivier to take a back seat to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, errors that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocent. Above all it really brings home that humanity is capable of removing all the normal rules of "civilization". There is something clearly Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still upset him and fascinate him for 60 years. Perhaps there could be a later series called "The Century in War" because the twentieth century was indeed the century of horrors. I think it is an irony of immense importance that an event was necessary that caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series like this.
