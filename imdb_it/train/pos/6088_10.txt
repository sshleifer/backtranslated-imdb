Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they keep it working! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board seem to really hate this movie. Personally I can't see how it could be, but Envy is just one of those movies that you love or hate. Just like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen film ever made. Or you think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the most fun. Don't avoid this movie because of reviews. Watch it and see if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee you it's worth your money. If you don't like it ... well, you know now.
