The election is a Chinese mafia film, or triads in this case. Every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at the beginning it seems like a toss between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know it, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who he was a judge in Full Contact!). Although once Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and does everything possible to secure recognition as a new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie that I watch with gangsters, this is not an action movie. He has his bloody moments when needed, like in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There are a lot of characters, which is really hard to follow, but I think it plays a bit in the madness of it all. A 100-year-old wand, which is the symbol of the power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things calm down. And although it may seem that the film ends in a vote of 65 or 70 minutes, there are still a couple of big surprises waiting. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and a sort of still photo. <br /> <br /> The election was rather the winner of last year at the Hong Kong Film Awards, winning as best actor (Tony Leung), best film, best director (Johnny To, who did Heroic Trio! !) and the best script. He also had nominations for cinematography, editing, soundtrack (which I loved) and three other performances (including Yam).
