This film has finally been released on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this film so many times and I find it really current in these days (2003) when Italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship (or from the United States for that matter). I'm glad there are some outcasts like the one played by Mastroianni in this film that can sing out of tune; perhaps they can teach the Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie: as most people have already mentioned, the acting is wonderful but the audio background is amazing. I have to assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the show of machismo, the distortion of reality in that ubiquitous radio chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can really make you shudder! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
