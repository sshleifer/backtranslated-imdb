This snappy and fun short of 1916 - the era in which Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - stages the young Oliver Hardy as a neer-go-well who must quickly impress his rich uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are more wives and children than I can bear; in addition to the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of the slapstick of the first films. <br /> <br /> Well restored it can be seen as part of "The Early Films of Oliver Hardy" and is now available on DVD, a nice addition to the available corpus of the big-screen favorite comedy duo.
