Usually the musicals of the 40s were of a fixed formula - and if you studied the films you know what I'm talking about - a certain length of performance, very "showy" performances that were great on the surface but never entered into real personalities of the characters etc. <br /> <br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and better light years and it's worth it for the best photo of the year - 1945 (although he didn't have the chance to beat the eventual winner - Lost Weekend). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - yes, I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This is different. He really enters his character of a "sea dog" thinking (at first) that "picking up a girl while on vacation" is nothing but a lark. And if I had to invent a "story" to have it - so be it - until when. A bit like the music man when he gets "the foot caught in the door". The eventual hilarity of the film derives mainly from the attempt on his part and his new friend (Sinatra) to make the "story" good to "take the girl" of which REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love. You'll have to see the movie to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Besides this there are many other elements of the great film in this, it is a classic story of friends, the nostalgia of a time when the Second World War was almost over (the war ended about a month after the release of the films), the awareness that a boy who always laughed at life can discover that he is really a great human being, great songs and probably some other element of classic cinema that I can't think of right now. <br /> <br /> Why not a 10? Towards the end - at about 2 and a half hours he starts feeling a little long. There is a small number of ballets that Gene Kelly did in 1945, but it looks dated and seems to add only a few minutes. But overall, this is a winner defined at every level.
