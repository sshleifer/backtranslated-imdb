I think this film is well done and realistic. I am used to watching Hollywood "action" movies, and I use it as a standard to evaluate this film, you are bound to be disappointed. This film is much closer to the real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and this is what elevates it above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish army and therefore cannot report errors in the way they act. But since I saw the extra "making of" I am convinced that a lot has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a film that I will recommend others to watch. High quality realistic history and movies.
