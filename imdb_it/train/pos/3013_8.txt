The talented investigator Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to investigate a seemingly reduced suicide case and has good reason to suspect that it is indeed something much more, a rather deliciously complex murder! <br /> <br /> As for the films of the mysteries of the crime, there is nothing better than this. Populated by suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all with good reasons to kill the apparent suicide victim Archer Coe, it's really hard to imagine or cover his head, but boy, is it fascinating to see it unfold? Before us. Even the policemen, the coroner and the district attorney prove to be colorful, have enriched the characters by adding a level of gritty unexpected realism to this person's proceedings and amplifying his overall "fun" factor. I particularly liked the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), which always seems to be interrupted abruptly and untimely by the discovery of corpses or wounded during the execution time of this one. Even Detective Sgt. Of Eugene Palette Heath offers welcome, often later delightfully funny at his expense, critical comment during Vance's investigation. I can't think of any valid criticism to actually give this film, except perhaps that it hasn't dated particularly well. However, it does not prevent the film from being simply fun. Look and see if you can close your head around the mystery of this. Highly recommended try it!
