If you want a brainless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic vision of Seattle, then this is the show for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of Dark Angel is nothing new (in fact, there is controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book), but I spend the whole hour watching it every Tuesday from start at the end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba is smoking and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a hit. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max must be a little better (the jargon seems forced and it seems that someone living in the suburbs wrote it). /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great pleasure filled with everything an action fan might ask, but if you're looking for a dramatic and award-winning movie, go see "The West Wing" or something.
