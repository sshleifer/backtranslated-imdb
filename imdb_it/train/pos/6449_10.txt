I was brought to this film by a friend and I was skeptical about a Swedish movie with subtitles. However, I enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of has been safely portrayed without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility against brutality and hope against tragedy has been illustrated by a satisfying angle using a spectrum of characters with flaws and very natural features. I particularly liked how the film managed to deal with multiple aspects of hypocritical human behavior concerning prejudice, discrimination and hypocritical fiction. An absolute jewel of a film that I will promote to all those who will listen.
