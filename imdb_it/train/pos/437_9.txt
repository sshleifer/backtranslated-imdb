The enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It was one of my 10 favorite movies since it came out. I continue to wait, even if with less patience, for the film to be released in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If Amazon's parent company listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and the direction are impeccable. The film is a real goalkeeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
