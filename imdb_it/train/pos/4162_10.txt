Yes it is. In fact, it's somewhere in my 20 favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. However, they are usually not one for plots, but I think that plots work better in anime video games and role-playing games (eg Final Fantasy 7 and not movies). But this has it all. Vibrant drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written script. Although this is not really for children, they can still watch it, it does not contain graphic blood, guts and silicone. But I don't think they will understand it.
