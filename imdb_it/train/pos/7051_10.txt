I would like to start by saying that "War, Inc" is not everyone's cup of tea. It is, however, very pleasant (and makes you think - "Oh, shit"). The comedy involved the film is not at all obvious - it's pretty thin (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning service etc.) And it changes with plot twists. <br /> <br /> I could be the only one, but I won't compare it to "Grosse Point Blank", because it's different. John Cusack - I wouldn't say it was "surprising" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in his way of interpreting comic lines and timing, even though he was barely in the film (I would say the same as Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to do it. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role in the Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. The development of Duff as an actress is very evident in the film, and does a great job (even if her accent is a bit unreal). <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is what I would call "funny". It doesn't have a particular plot, and it's rather silly at times, but it has a subtle message. I would say that it is worth looking at.
