Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool. Unfortunately he finds out that his wife is doing outside with the pool attendant - he understands that behind everything clean, there is decay. He begins to torture his patients ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as a deranged dentist - he is completely credible. There is surprisingly little blood but the dental torture scenes are rather unpleasant and grotesque. Highly recommended. "Even The Dentist 2" is worth a try!
