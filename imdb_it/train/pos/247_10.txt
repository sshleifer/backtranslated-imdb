I love this movie, because it showed that they weren't killing for fun but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job playing Ned and Joe. It has some fast and inappropriate scenes, but that's okay too. The language is very mild and sometimes you don't even know it's there. This film shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean they are vicious killers! I hope people watch this movie and learn important moments in history like this. One thing that fascinates me about this film is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book that Ned looked at! And that's how people remember them, from their armor. I hope people watch this movie and take an interest like me.
