I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite by chance actually. If I had not had only 6 hours of sleep in the last two days, I would not have come home from work early. If I hadn't come home early from work, I wouldn't have seen this movie. I wouldn't have known what I was missing, but I would have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> This is the way this film is. He's almost playing on the effect of Kevin Bacon. That is causality (hence my verbiage above). Never is a character intertwined in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, not interaction. This film is simply wonderful. I'll have to find a copy to buy.
