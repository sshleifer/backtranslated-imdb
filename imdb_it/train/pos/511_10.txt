I see this film for the first time almost 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before the time of cable and satellite) Matinee. I was out of school with mumps and I was completely wrapped up in the film. I had it on a video bought for about 10 years and I want to get a copy on DVD. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time and I think it's a parody that has been seen so many times when the Oscars arrived. I also think the queen should have done it as a knight as she easily did for the film industry if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film moves from black and white to color and vice versa is well done and the film has prominent actors like Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and a first appearance by Richard Attenborough.
