Damn this was a completely captivating film. I couldn't believe I woke up so late to watch it but it came late, I started to watch that I couldn't stop having a full range of truly exceptional cast members, including Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many other well-known actors and actresses, this was more than a look at history, it was the opening of an eye in another part of society that people don't know and could even be embarrassed to talk. I have never heard of a book or a film about this before and this is something that the black story never turns to just looking down on it because they were private and mixed, I highly recommend this film
