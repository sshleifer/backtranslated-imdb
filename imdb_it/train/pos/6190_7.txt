Fay Grim is the continuation of a story that began ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I haven't seen the previous movie, and I don't know if it's a good thing or not. I can only consider the current film for its merits. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's film style is something you like or dislike. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry and ironic humor is really in tune with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of intelligent parody well written that made me and many of the Melbourne International Film Festival's people laugh. For the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with unmoved rectitude. It's a style of humor that sadly lacks in theaters and a welcome relief for brainy teen comedies that Hollywood sports like pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the film, humor begins to thin out as the film turns into an international espionage / conspiracy thriller. Whether this was Hartley's intention or if he was short of ideas is not clear, but I think a bit of editing or rewriting to cut fifteen minutes from the film would have kept the original momentum of the film. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most time on screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all played in good supporting roles. The images of the film were beautiful (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I enjoyed it immensely. If you like Hartley's previous work, you'll probably like it.
