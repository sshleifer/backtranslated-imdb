For me this was more like an alarm clock, and the awareness that most of everything we see, hear, read and think of everything depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level spin doctors who try to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people who have a constitution in which they have freely bought will not be influenced by this media control or by any attempt at incorrect information. Once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the many will effectively overcome the needs of the few. It is also illuminating to see that, in a country where there is no religious civil war, democracy is not a really difficult thing to do.
