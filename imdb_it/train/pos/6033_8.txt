I would just like to point out that this could be partial, since I am a producer of the film. However, I will maintain a certain sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The film's star, Oscar Ovies, gives a stellar performance like Jeff Grinderlin, a hazy hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. It brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the public to connect with him, affirming his mind often and with a sense of hard comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant ray of support that would have crumbled without him. Even his friends lend a hand in Jeff's life, often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will ... which he often overlooks is still there. <br /> <br /> The writing is superb, and the conversations flow like the scenes in a film by Kevin Smith, with half of Ben Affleck making boo-hoo jokes. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is a bit poor at some points, and the sound could also use a boost, however the out-performance shines the minor details. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a surprise. A rare gem among many jewels.
