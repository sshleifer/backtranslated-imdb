Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus it is magic, you will love it. If you didn't, what the hell did you do wrong? Congratulations to the Comedy Channel for pushing me in the face. My life finally has a meaning, and "Your car smells like farts" is my kind of humor. I'm a happy boy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I can't wait for it to come next week. This is how Grease meets South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could see by reading the column. Its delivery is precise and really fun. Never skip a beat. Come to think of it, it's not so much your choice of material. which is really a good thing, as is the way it chooses to deliver it. Thanks, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
