In her first non-analyst role, Esther Williams plays a school teacher victim of sexual violence. It gives a nice performance, proving that it could be very effective outside the pool. While the detective comes out to solve the case, George Nader offers perhaps his best interpretation. And it's so beautiful that it hurts! John Saxon is a student with suspicion and, although he gets an impressive billing in the credits, he is Edward Andrews as the overly protective father who is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Washed by the glorious Technicolor, The Unguarded Moment is irresistible hokum and sometimes compelling drama.
