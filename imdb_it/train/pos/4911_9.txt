This film has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences in the last ten years. The three threads of the plot that Kazan gave us have their unique and separate pleasures. The domestic chatter between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the rooms, the small gestures like the book that Barbara puts on the chair under her son to reach the table, those little intimate exchanges between husband and wife, are all well done and natural . More than anything else, I love their porch, that second living room where it is clear that they spend most of their summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between the characters of Widmark and Douglas. It may not be entirely original and becomes a bit stormy, but all in all, it is real, respectful and efficient. The third thread, the ramshackle tale of Blackie and his little tattered gang, make us the closest to a dark and scary noir world. Palance's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-taught man clearly has a complexity that we merely briefly mention. For me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience.
