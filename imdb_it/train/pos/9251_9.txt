what can I say ?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl of all time, and as an Italian American, a fan of female beauty, I can't forget this movie. <br /> <br /> you know that I really don't do it I remember a lot about the plot, or the situations or the other actors. I can only remember Erika beautiful and dead and that in this film she looks more beautiful than ever, I don't care if it's a bad movie or a good movie, I just care about the good times when I was a teenager in Brooklyn just contemplating the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well, just to conclude if you are a fan of Erika Eleniak's beauty like me, surely this movie is for you.
