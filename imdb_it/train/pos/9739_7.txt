I enjoyed watching this movie, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid box office project for comedy films. <br /> <br /> He is hired by his blind alley in London, publishing a big movie in New York. Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrity rags. <br /> <br /> After paying his debts, he makes him the highest level of celebrity who writes hackdom (the "seventh room"), where he comes to be a minor celebrity himself. The plot is a lot of fun, and Gillian Anderson has an impressive supporting role as a ruthless advertising agent. <br /> <br /> On the road to success, find the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <Apart from the terrific plot, the film was a lot of fun, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was as good as the love interest. The rest of the supporting cast did its job well. <br /> <br /> This was a good play and it's worth a look at the theaters.
