Dan Katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller coaster journey through a true love story set in the problems surrounding modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For those who have ever been in love, the film shows the uncertainties, insecurities and anxieties that make love so sweet-bitter. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time only serves to intensify the feeling. Immediately, you are attracted to Dan's difficult situation, and you cannot fail to be deeply moved. <br /> <br /> You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the desperate reality of Dan, kidnapped the relationship with Iris, and the realities of a tumultuous state make this absolutely observable. If you have an ounce of passion and have never been in love, watch this movie.
