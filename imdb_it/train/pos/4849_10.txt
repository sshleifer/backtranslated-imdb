The Ghost Train is a pleasure for those who appreciate the typical humor of the 1940s. It incorporates the plot of the Second World War into the plot, but not as much as I initially thought, and the characters are a unique blend that plays their roles quite well. Askey, playing the role of Tommy Gander, is what illuminates the story for the parts that could be portrayed as boring or "enthralling". <br /> <br /> The history of the haunted station is truly spooky even for the present day standard. It's unique and the way the characters communicate with each other is great for reviving the mystery of The Ghost Train. Gander is basically a nuisance to all other members while the rest gets along pretty well. He is always the center of attention and can be called "annoying", but it is from those who do not appreciate the humor of 1940. His humor is innocent and childish which makes him sweet to look at. <br /> <br /> Were it not for Askey / Gander, this film would have been shorter in action, fun and the result would not have been as effective in my opinion.
