Nice film. It tells a story of childish fantasy, telling us how we are trapped in social situations and what kind of extreme measures must be taken to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: that you have to break every rule if you want to break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you didn't know, how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation? It also concerns fascism in deciding on the cultural life of others, on what kind of culture is confused in our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or the kamikaze the right to decide what our choice is. It is not allowed to drink morning coffee alone. Do we have to listen to the screams of the NRJ, see the stupid scandals and the commercials before we even had morning coffee?
