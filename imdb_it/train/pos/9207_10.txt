Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest film of 1971. Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, the film describes not only the theme of a destroyed family, but also a relationship between a brother and a sister, as well as the drug and the hippie movement, which made many people think it involved ISKON - the Krishna consciousness movement. <br /> <br /> The film begins with drug scenes and is informed that the woman who dances in front is that of the sister narrator. Back in the past, brother and sister enjoy playing at home just to hear their parents arguing. This soon leads to a division in the family. The brother goes with his mother and sister with his father. <br /> <br /> Over the years, the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that he no longer lives with his father and that he has moved to Nepal. Here, Prashant, the brother not only finds love, but also finds his sister, Janice. But he finds that he is not alone in the wrong company of friends, but is also drugged because he wants to block all the memory of his past. With the help of Shanti, his love, the brother tries to distance his sister from all this, but he has to overcome many obstacles, including people who lower themselves at all levels to stop him. This is a multi-cast film and is led by the director and the producer himself, Dev Anand, who also stars Zeenat Aman (his first film), Mumtaz, Rajendranath, Prem Chopra, Jnr Mehmood, AK Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly provided by the late Burman Burman, whose last achievement is "1942 - A Love Story". During filming, Dev Anand asked Panchamda (RD Burman) to compose something special for this film. Days later Panchamda returned with the composition of "Dum Maro Dum". The song was an immediate success.
