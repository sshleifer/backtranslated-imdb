In an age of such horrible cartoons, I'm rather shocked to see a movie with so much good morals do it in the bottom list of IMDB for animated films. <br /> <br /> This film contradicts the first. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age range for this film, I didn't even notice, nor would it matter if I did. The people who did could have used "New Generation" to note that this is another way the Care Bear family could have started. Maybe we should decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite film at the age of 3-6, and it didn't frighten me or confuse me at all. > <br />
