I've seen Dirty Work several times and it's probably my favorite Stan and Ollie shortly. <br /> <br /> In this, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at Professor Noodle's house (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is doing crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos trying to clean the fireplace and mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a special formula tank that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part is where Ollie falls off the chimney and a lot of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much from this. <br /> <br /> The dirty work is Stan and Ollie in their most fun time. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
