This is a fan-made short film pretending to be a preview of a new movie that matches Batman and Superman! It's the kind of movie that fans love and watch in places like ComicCon and was created by the same person who created BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As for this film, I could easily choose separately. Of course, the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are anything but perfect. BUT, this was done with a small budget and for a fan it's incredible. I was particularly impressed by the super funny Superman - he was not an asshole kid! If only this was a preview of a real movie - they would have fans lined up from here to Omaha to see it. Good job.
