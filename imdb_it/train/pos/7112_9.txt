An excellent wartime film that shows the effects of war on a boy from a city who loses sight of Guadalcanal and has to go home and readjust with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast of actors helps make this movie a lot of fun. The role of Eleanor Parker as a girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. You have such innocence for her in this movie. The role of Ann Doran was equally satisfying, as were all of her small secondary roles. I especially like the aura of Phildelphia prebellica's home town. The hunting scene is very good. Obviously the war scene of Guadalcanal showed the horror of our soldiers during this epic battle. A worthy film and one not to be forgotten
