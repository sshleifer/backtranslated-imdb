This deserves a 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and true stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode and this is the real quality. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a couple of New Yorkers, plays with the concept of six degrees of separation and intelligently intertwines their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are fantastic, as is the lovely Caseman. The scenery is incredible and the closets are exquisite. We need more shows like this that make viewers feel like smart individuals, not mindless drones. <br /> <br /> If it never comes back, six grades will really be missed.
