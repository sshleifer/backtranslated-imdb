This animation has a very good plot directed against evil and concerns action. What distinguishes it from other animations is how human movements are animated. It was really nice to see the runaway woman running from the left to the right of the screen and look around, her movements were done so well. Why don't they use this rotoscope technique more these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in its prehistoric environment and in poorly dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. Some may hate it and consider it as another fantastic male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) will love its aesthetic quality. I certainly didn't mind! Bakshi loves to animate lustful and voluptuous girls, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he should apologize because it's an animation for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and never forgot it. <br /> <br /> This was just special, so different from the normal Disney or Anime fare, and for that reason alone it's worth watching is probably the best of Bakshi. For those who love animations with lustful women: try also Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give fire and ice 8 out of 10.
