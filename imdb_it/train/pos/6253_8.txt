This movie is fantastic. As often heard, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike other people, I am not of the opinion that it is depressing, negativistic or dismantling Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: While there are indeed some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters have to be called very bad people, at the same time look at love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls' film. And that's exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to show the life of "ordinary people" in an intense and realistic way; their bustle, their desires, their dark sides: Seidl clearly never tries to prove that workers' lives are rubbish! In my opinion, viewers arriving at this conclusion seem to be very afraid to admit that almost no one lives is as clean and normal as we would like others to believe. And that every life has its dark and often depressing side. The most beautiful scene: the old Viennese man, looking at his old girl who dances "the eastern street", as he calls it. I think all those who find this scene ugly lack a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, this is proto-fascist: the characters of HUNDSTAGE or spectators, who are turned off by the body of a 70-year-old woman who dances with all his charm for his lover.
