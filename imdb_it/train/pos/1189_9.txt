The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to tackle buffalo hunting, both as a sport and as a business and as a way to win the Indian wars on the plains. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains had American bison herds the size of some of our largest cities. At the time of The Last Hunt's setting, the buffalo was almost wiped out. The 20th century, thanks to the efforts of environmentalists, has seen an awakening of the population of the species, but it has not been as it used to be. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger are co-stars in a second film together and this is far superior to All brothers were brave. Here Stewart Granger is the good boy, a tired buffalo hunter of the world, who must return to a job he hates due to financial considerations. <br /> <br /> The partner with whom he chose to enter is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor for the moment, I doubt that there was ever a meaner, meaner soul than Charlie Gilsen portraying Taylor. In Devil's Doorway he was an American Indian who fought against the prejudice caused by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, it's the racist here. It kills both buffaloes and Indians for pleasure. He kills an Indian family when they steal his mules and take a prisoner's widow. As a barbarian conqueror, he expects the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. He's really angry when Paget doesn't see it that way. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed, I was never really convinced that I was somewhere in India. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, Taylor and Granger's old black buffalo hole is fantastic. Nolan steals every scene he's in with the cast. <br /> <br /> For those who love their westerns, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on screen, and who do not like economic heroism, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
