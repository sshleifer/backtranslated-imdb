One of the things that most interested me about this film is the way the characters and the associated stories are developed on the fly. I suppose the writers wanted us to be interested in the characters by not forcing them to feed their characters. The premise of using art and the craft of design and construction of furniture was a theme and / or an analogy unique to what families / brothers cross in life. The complexity of having a twin serves as a surrogate father and even the husband has added great tension in making this film emotionally interesting. Furthermore, although the story was not what the masses could directly relate to (ie Jews / twins / family), the themes are quite universal as each family has a black sheep in it. This made it very engaging.
