Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action, chaos, murders and gruesome bloodletting. The essential elements are the search and destruction of a bodyguard's mission while his appointee, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent. The positions of Mexico City are chaotic while the plot moves towards its predictable and violent conclusion, with twists and turns along the way. Washington, a former CIA agent with alcohol problems, receives a good reference from a former colleague who sets the plot in motion. Washington and Fanning have a great harmony between them and after a problematic start, the bodyguard and his office become the best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke are the good cast in support of the two stars.
