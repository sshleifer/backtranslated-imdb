New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, with each segment lasting about 10 minutes. The shorts don't exactly refer but they all have something in common, love. Every brief is to find love, whether it's a couple or just two strangers chatting. The film stars a cast of actors, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise, I expected an incredible film; the problem is New York, I Love You is not added. The sum of its parts remains. Some segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are so meaningless (segments of Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q) which is terrifying. The film is decidedly irregular and has a very experimental tone. From the point of view of history, it seems something that some film students could put together. That said, the film also has great moments, one of the best is the segment of an old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who strolls through Brooklyn for their 67th wedding anniversary. And these are moments like this that made me become a spectator, I would like the film to be more coherent, because there is a lot of potential here. But, however unsatisfactory the overall story is, for me, cinematography and the soundtrack saved it all. The editing was perfect, the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldn't be more suitable. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental film, and like most experiences there are ups and downs. It's how you look at the film as a whole that will determine if you like it or not. It could be useful for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
