I was 15 when this film was shown on television. Having grown up in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This film has touched my emotional teenage heart and I remembered it fondly for the past 12 years. I recently saw it for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the film reaches and touches my confused inner teenager.
