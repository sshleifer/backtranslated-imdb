The Best of Times is one of the great sleepers of all time. The setup does not tolerate your patience, development is constant, the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established, the gags and spikes all work and all are fun. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell who plays Reno Hightower does one of his best performances, and Robin Williams who plays Jack Dundee is always sure. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jack's wife is played by the daughter of Jack Palance, who is adorable, as is Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie, how many times I've had fun and how many times I wish more people could see it.
