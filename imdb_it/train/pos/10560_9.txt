Jimmy Cagney constantly competes with his eyes in this story of a theater producer who is struggling vigorously against the next "talking" films. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dances is presented in such a way that as a spectator you are never treated in a boring moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done. History has never really been lost in this frenetic pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated, but it does not matter, because when you look at this in the time of 1933 it is fabulous to see this next to many other series of films that have been released in that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a show for irritated eyes in this film, without ever losing its composure as always executive producer of previews made for cinemas as introductions. In this way he tries to save his ass from his failure, he was a broadway producer before he started. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest, Nan, offers such a lively performance that is so unusual for the films of that time, so nice to see a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the film was the huge productions at the end. These were magnificent in themselves, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced, but they didn't seem to fit the story. The only link they have with the main story is that Cagney had to do 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had felt during the whole movie and that these sets could fit in the cinema. In this way the "Sitting On A Backyard Fence" was much more appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end seemed to drag this frantic story to a halt and this was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then I realized that there were two more coming. These sequences have aroused much enthusiasm even among the public. <br /> <br /> All in all a fantastic film with a harsh finish. <br /> <br /> 9/10
