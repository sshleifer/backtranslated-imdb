As a boy, I always hated "Cinderella", since I was put in the minority by my two sisters when my parents were considering the Disney movie to buy. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won, and we have "Cinderella". They enjoyed the movie while I sat in the back of the room playing my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> Much has changed since then. My love for Disney theme parks made me do an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young grandchildren. I like to show them Disney as much as possible, and we recently saw "Cinderella" together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I looked at "Cinderella" with a new perspective and was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, however, I didn't understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible situation. Why was she so slave of her stepmother, and why couldn't she escape? I was not very nice with Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself immersed in history. Perhaps the eye-catching animation or fun-loving characters attracted me, or maybe they were timeless songs. Listening to songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A dream is a wish that your heart makes" brought me back to the theme parks again. I can imagine myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere as I look at the imposing Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this movie evokes only the magic of Disney. This could make many people laugh, but go to the magical kingdom and see all the girls dressed as Cinderella who are excited to be in this fantastic world, and you will know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most loved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> While "Cinderella" may not be the strongest story, it is a kind of icon of Disney and the history of cinema. It represents the amusing, idealistic and fantastic wonder we had when we were children. I imagine this film has a lot of meaning for many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire about the Company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (exceptional)
