British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: quiet, introspective, usually romantic, and farce and social satire. Settings, characters and concepts vary but some features place most shows in one of two categories. Butterflies is perhaps the epitome of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very verbal, including long inner monologues of the main character Ria, a fundamentally happy but unstable housewife, intrigued by what might have been lost when she started a completely conventional life. When he meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his interest in her clear), he plays with the idea of ​​finding out what the other path could offer. <br /> <br /> Acting and scripts are always in the money, which makes their reaction to the show almost entirely personal: I was neither wiped out nor turned off. On the other hand, my mother loved this show. I think the degree to which one identifies with Ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies.
