This film is simply brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who considered himself a liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing, so much so that when Donald Woods appeared on TV a few years later, I recognized him from his performance. Denzel Washington is also transformed into a masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I urge you to watch this. It's long, but it's worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, people, it really happened.
