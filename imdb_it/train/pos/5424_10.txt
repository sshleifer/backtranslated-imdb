"Gunga Din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever told! A story about the British foreign legion in 19th century India and a humble "water carrier" named Gunga Din, a local resident who aspires to be just like his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose mutual loyalty and camaraderie extend far beyond the limits of simple patriotism. Theirs is a true and lasting friendship for each other and everyone would be willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of the other. Gunga Din also wishes to be a soldier, a Bugler in particular, but he will never be able to achieve this degree because of his subordinate social position. However, heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they are made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. Gunga Din tries every turn to prove his courage, but will he ever reach the level he is so passionately looking for? ... "You're a better man than me, Gunga Din"! One of the Hollywood classics and a perfect 10 !!!!
