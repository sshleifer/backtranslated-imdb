This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone. In my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on a par are movies like The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a strange background that has many more friends than boys than girls. It really sucks you in your life. Certainly I cannot criticize anyone of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was also interesting for someone like me who has no idea of ​​the rules. The film is never boring. The love story is really pretty and it didn't make me blush too much! But one thing that really made it was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians and there are many colorful conferences throughout the film that provide a very interesting cultural vision and everything else. Even the Indians are hilarious! Essentially this is a training film about the possibility of choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Good comedies are becoming my favorite kind of movie thanks to this movie. They are fun, they are refreshing and they make you feel good! ^ _ ~
