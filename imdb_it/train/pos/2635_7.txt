My Take: A fun version of THE LION KING, posing as a sequel. Surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another straight-to-video fun, which is worth a theatrical treatment. I don't see why Disney released this film directly at the cinema, and theatrically distribute crappy films like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland". Those films are best seen in video stores (in the "new releases" area), rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside theaters. <br /> <br /> This is just a parody of the first film (although the events of "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place), on the point of view of Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella). We can see them teasing events in the first movie. The original voices of the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their parting roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give an exhilarating comedy remedy to Timon's mother and to her uncle. /> <br /> So it doesn't look funny. Maybe not now, but go see it alone. The fact that he is not so serious in the plot makes him the most pleasant. It's a bit like the MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the video of the video: *** 1/2 of 5.
