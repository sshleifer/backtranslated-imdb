this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun, throwback action movie, it won't win any prizes and it's not very original, but it offers the goods you'd like to see from a Dolph Lundgren movie. our dolph man is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a tough internal school and when he is caught by terrorists it is up to him to save the day. of course the script won't win any Oscar and has its right dose of explosive action. dolph lundgren offers a good performance, but it livens up even more in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they keep it well. all in all the detention is a nice action movie, but you've seen it a million times before.
