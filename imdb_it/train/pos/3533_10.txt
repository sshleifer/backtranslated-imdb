Unfortunately not yet available on DVD, but it's worth continuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an attempt to establish the truth. A film with many twists and turns, none of which I will mention! The jazz band's sequence in which our heroine searches for information on the murderer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite having a very low budget and being realized during the Second World War in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks a bit mountainous - this is a film of original style and exceptional vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew a lot about these things, founding the most feverish women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was one of many German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - that the emigrants moved to Hollywood and brought with them a very original original vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines has never been assigned such a large part, and in the end it ended up in little westerns.
