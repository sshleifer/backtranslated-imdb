AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller so rare for American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many spectators the shivers. We rooted for Caleb as he struggled to resist the openings of Sheriff Lucas. We have become absorbed and fearful in learning the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that weekly gave reason to fear what Lucas would do later were really surprising. This show was up to the "gothic" moniker as American entertainment was rarely attempted, much less mastered. The seeds certainly made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts the shame on the current excess of "reality" shows, which are far less than a satisfying vision. The request for a DVD box set is well founded. This show is quality visualization for a demanding market hungry for quality vision. An audience tired of the excess of saturation with the reality of reality, this true storytelling gem will happen. Bring on the DVD box !!
