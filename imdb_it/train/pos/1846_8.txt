When I first read the plot of this drama, I thought it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama is nothing like that. The stories of the characters seem more real and you identify yourself more in situations. The concept of drama is similar, four women something that guides us through friendships and relationships with problems and conflicts along the way. Katie, the GP, is a dark and gloomy character who finds it difficult to relate and is Trudi widow's best friend. The character of Trudi has a warm heart because you can relate to the difficulties she is having along with the fact that she is the only mother of the four. Jessica is a very determined party girl and knows what she wants and how to get it. He is a nice character and is the closest person to Siobhan, the newly married woman, who, while completely loving her husband, cannot help her eyes wander around her work colleague. Over all the drama is surprisingly compelling and if the BBC continues to produce the series it could do well. Unlike other female cast dramas like Sex and the city, or Desperate Housewives. This if played well could be the next cold foot. Furthermore, the male cast is not bad for the eyes.
