I couldn't take my eyes off this movie when it appeared on the cable. Dialogue and customs are of a quality more easily associated with soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for series with nunchuks. (Maybe even for sex, but not for Indian TV, anyway.) <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of the genre, I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and I had no chance of searching. Only once did Brigitte Nielsen trade with her futuristic nurse's cap (so mayor!) For the fade of the high top we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II I made her positive ID. <br /> <br /> This film will no doubt entertain any couture admirer of the early 1990s or sniffing and sniffing Paul Verhoeven schlock. Can we add a gender tag for "so-bad-is-good"?
