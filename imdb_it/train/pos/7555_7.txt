Gender Bender reveals things for x files a bit. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an ending that is missing. Gender Bender is also the debut of the x-files for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of "The Kindred". You have to see this episode just to see the less spectacular start of Nic Lea. An interesting thing about the "seductive power" of the Brother. When Marty does it to his victims, they turn into him / her. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she only because she is disoriented and groggy, and does not become attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be depressing to film in British Columbia. During the episode it's so wet, soaked and muddy, it wouldn't have been so fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to see.
