Domestic Import was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was fun on so many levels, from crazy clothes to hilarious situations. The acting was great. At Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did a fantastic job. Because it's an independent film written by a writer for the first time, it doesn't have the clich√©s expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. It was a unique and interesting event and you fell in love with the characters and the story that warms your heart. Did I hear that it was based on a true story? If so, then it's fun (and surprising!). I highly recommend this movie.
