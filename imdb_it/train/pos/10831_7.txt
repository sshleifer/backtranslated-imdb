An excellent cast makes this film work; all the characters are very well developed and it is clear that the actors enjoyed shooting this film. <br /> <br /> It is not really the comedy that I expected, much more a carefree look at the attempt to reclaim the youthful glory than the obscene humor. For music lovers there are some subtle references that are cleverly amusing in themselves. <br /> <br /> I hate drawing direct comparisons with other films, but so much of this film reminded me of Alan Parker's films that I can't help him: imagine if the Commitments actually made it great - and then you tried to to regain glory 25 years later.
