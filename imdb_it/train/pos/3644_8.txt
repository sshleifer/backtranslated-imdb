The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40-year-old teacher in Big Lake, Texas, who reaches the majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a science teacher and middle school baseball coach. His team is losing terribly until the team finds out that their coach has played in minor leagues and can launch a 98 mph shot. <br /> <br /> After launching the batting practice and making a bet, Jim agrees that if his team wins regional, he will try for the Major Leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy as a guy to play in his first major game. It's a great loser story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worthy of note, giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> History takes some time to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but everything works fine in the end. The baseball scenes are fun, well filmed and beautifully portrayed. The film is not about baseball but about finding a man to achieve his dream. It's inspiring, exciting and it's fun. I liked it, I hope you do it. <br /> <br /> The Rookie. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
