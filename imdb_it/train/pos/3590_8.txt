I just saw this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it would just be another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane went into boxing because she wanted to do it. I thought this movie was good. I gave it an 8/10. It's so beautiful. Furthermore, a film with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. She was also in just six years.
