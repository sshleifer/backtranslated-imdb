This is a real character and a plot-based drama at a level that shames most of what we see on TV at the moment. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the beginning. Don't be discouraged if you are not a wax (like me ...). It could happen on earth, the fact that it is in another galaxy makes the show more interesting. there are no spaceships or laser guns (none yet, anyway) So far I've seen up to s01 and 04 and I'm taken and I'm wondering what will happen next how many are the possibilities. <br /> <br /> The cast plays the roles with the pasions. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show really stands out on its own, it doesn't matter if you have watched BSG or not, actually they are very different. I've read some negative reviews of sci-fi geeks who expected fewer dramas and more aliens and ray guns, etc., but I'd say ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start to a show. We hope that you don't have to go after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days.
