The only time I saw this film was when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years because I couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it. I was absolutely shocked. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Vale, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to see as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out which movie it was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was present and finally managed to get the name and reviews on it. I liked it a lot, but it gave me enough fear! Jaqui
