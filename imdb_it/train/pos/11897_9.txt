This is a nice horror film that independent film fans will really enjoy. He has good acting, lots of blood and a decent plot. One will be reminded of films like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget has not been so great, but the film compensates for it with atmosphere and solid performance of the actors, which seems to be missing in many of today's rich special effects films. The film moves really long and there is an excellent direction and a good job of shooting. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the film is a bit short. Also, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this.
