I continually take family and friends around for my tears about the movies, and they didn't disappoint me when I saw this. I cried many times, but believe me, the flavor was not over. It hurt for my family and it hurt for this man when he tried to redeem himself from the only way he knew. Denzel was as fabulous as ever, as was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I didn't even recognize him; the years have not been kind to him. My husband is not one that makes movies see again unless they are historically accurate war movies (Russians !!!!). He saw this movie 5 times and I'm going to get the DVD to watch it again because he wore the ribbon jumped for as long as I was watching.
