On the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. Under the veneer, he is the protagonist of the MGM to be stunt-casting in the most fun way. <br /> <br /> Leads are simple, but all secondary ones are very much expressed against the type. Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (obsessive-compulsive professional fussbudget), Sig Ruman (the nemesis of the Marx Brothers in _Night In Casablanca_ and the ever-wonderful _Night At The Opera_), who plays well-intentioned band that tries to put together the two protagonists, instead of having them split up as they will do their "usual" characters. <br /> <br /> It also takes into account many conventions of romantic comedies, which is another indication that this might not be a romantic heterosexual comedy, as it is an ironic grimace of the many post-war romantic comedies and of their two-dimensional and original characters. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, with interruptions, so I can't be positive, but this film could be one of those that worked best in the context of the moment it was made, but it has less success now that viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different goal. I assume this is the case when I give them 9 stars. I thought he was hysterical.
