For me this film was powerful. I don't want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; we were like brothers. This film brought me vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I could not express my vote for this film which would have been a 10. I kept getting a message like "No vote has been entered. ..." Yet I saw in the statistics that were there. I'll try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Less defects I have neglected. It was the relationships between the characters that captured me. Wonderfully recited and real situations. I've been in a couple of them. <br /> <br /> A little jewel of a movie. Just like "Spring Forward" is another neglected gem. I am very happy that films like these are still made; on relationships between people, well written, sensibly explained with first-class acting and directing. After all, isn't that why?
