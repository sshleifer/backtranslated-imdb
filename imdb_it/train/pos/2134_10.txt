Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an exceptional group of films that will live on forever, as in the case of "The Shop Around the Corner". This film has been reproposed in other less distinguished films and in a musical comedy, without the charm or elegance of the original version of Mr. Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart have worked together on several films. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in a film without almost appearing acting. Both stars are as delicious as pen pals they don't know, but destiny made them work together in the same Budapest store. The reason why these classic films worked so well is the extraordinary support throws the studies put together into one image after another. Here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, who plays the shop owner. Furthermore, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing an impressive job in making us believe that yes, I am in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these films will live forever!
