Don't waste time reading my review. Get out and see this surprisingly good episode, which could very well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon was chosen to play the mysterious and charming mystery writer who kills her son-in-law to avenge her murder of her daughter. Columbo is his usual, rumpled, confused and much smarter than it looks, and this particular episode features a fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by the creators announced Levinson or Link is perhaps the densest, most original and tortuous Columbo plot ever. Absolutely satisfying in almost every department and overflowing with funny and witty dialogues and thoughts. The truly unexpected and inventive climax surpasses all. 10/10 ... look for this on Netflix!
