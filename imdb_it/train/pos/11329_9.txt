The combination of superb black and white photography and the "Eugene Onegin with a twist" plot made this a real hit for me. The atmosphere created by the mostly dark shots, in contrast to the occasional very bright overexposed white, was compelling. There was a magnificent moment in which the transparencies - apparently conventional shots of the holidays but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantaneously - were shown accompanied by Lensky's harrowing air from Tschaikowsky's work Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities offered by that medium, which means that history is often less important than images and atmosphere - Last year at Marienbad it's a good example of a film like that. Krisana is in the same mold.
