Those of you familiar with the dEUS group, know the singer Tom Barman. He directed this film a bit like creating music, it's a mix of everything. This is a comedy, although mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters has a happy life to say the least, and in reality it has no goal. <br /> <br /> The film begins on a Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several people, some of them have nothing in common but will come into contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that nobody reads, a young researcher with the morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young people constantly in touch with the law, a man working in a cinema and two young women A man who has something to do with the wind walks around the film. All the characters have their problems, with family or friends or just with life itself. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port. The events of the day are not easily explained, I simply recommend watching the film, there is simply too much to say. But I can say that Barman has a great use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mainly dance music, not rock) to create an atmosphere, especially the party is full of excellent music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experience on itself, it will not leave you speechless about life, maybe just that you have to live it and not waste it, or have false moral truths. <br /> <br /> In short, seeing it, it's definitely worth it!
