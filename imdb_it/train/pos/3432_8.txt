This is one of those reference films that must be placed in the context of time. The charm of Tallinn was made in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and disorder not only for the ordinary inhabitants of Estonia, but also for countless citizens of other former nations who were part of the powerful Soviet empire. He was in a climate so tense that a young country named Estonia was born. As it is known that newly established governments encounter initial problems, Estonia has also faced numerous problems while some corrupt officials manipulated the machinery state to fill their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means. This is one of the central themes of this film. DARKness in Tallinn looks like an Estonian film but was made by a Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He did his best to infuse as many doses of Estonian humor as possible. This is why you can call a comedy film of political undertone. As ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film means good against evil. it is not a new concept as it is readily available in most religious books of different faiths. The darkness at Talinn shows us how ordinary governments can be overthrown by corrupt people. A nice movie to watch on a sunny day.
