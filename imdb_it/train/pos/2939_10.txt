Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the most fun. Delirious is the best cabaret comedy I've ever seen and it's a must for anyone who loves a good laugh !! I've seen this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have a bully fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you that you will have to watch it several times to hear all the jokes because you will laugh so much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is fun! <br /> <br /> Although there are many fun comedians out there - after seeing this comedy standing, many of them will look like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it, take it, look at it and you'll love it !! It will drive you crazy !!! :-)
