I intend to go out on a limb, and actually defend "Shades of Gray" as a good clip-show episode, which deepened the struggle of life and death of commander William Thomas Riker who was fighting a deadly terminal illness. > <br /> The scenes of the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood in which Riker was when he relived his romantic episodes such as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Tragic moments were highlighted as the death of Tasha in "Skin of Evil", as well as elements of danger pulsations in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the aforementioned "Skin of Evil". Riker also showed courage under fire by recounting some humorous jokes like "One of my ancestors was bitten by a rattlesnake once ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake is dead". This episode highlighted the psychological proof of Will Riker under extreme hardness. And, YES, I am partial in my opinion in proclaiming "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode, because at the time of its original airing, my face was covered with sweat, wondering if Riker would make it come alive and alive other great galactic adventures, outerspace beyond the last frontier ... <br /> <br /> Of course, in the following years, I seem to have formed a unique opinion of this particular episode ... but, if a prize should go for "the best clip-show episode in television history", so I think this episode should be highly regarded in this regard.
