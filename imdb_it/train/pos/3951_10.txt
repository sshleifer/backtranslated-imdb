I've only seen this movie once, on TV, and it hasn't been repeated. This is strange when considering the garbage that is repeated over and over again. Usually horror movies are a source of fun for me, but this really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE NEXT BIT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM STILL <br /> <br /> The scariest thing is when the citizens pursue the preacher where his wife lies almost dead (they had poisoned her ). He asks who the hell are people anyway. One by one they give their true identity. The girl who pretended to be deaf to bribe him and seduce him says "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve".
