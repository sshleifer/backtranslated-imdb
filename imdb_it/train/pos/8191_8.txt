The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together constitute the two best episodes of the "new" second season of Doctor Who. Having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of Quatermass and the Pit (1967) into a scenario of outer space, with the story of the universe intertwined with that of the Beast 666. These episodes cement emotional ties between Rose and the Doctor, highlighting also Rose's growing self-confidence, establishing her as not exactly the same partner but with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is the elegant script by Matt Jones, which decreases the occasional excessive addiction to one-liners for the Doctor, and the performances of the entire cast, in particular the excellent Shaun Parkes as acting by Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
