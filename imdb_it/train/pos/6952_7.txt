In New York, when the shy and lonely project manager of a design studio Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) in the subway, he invites her to go out and have dinner with him. Jenny immediately falls in love with him, they have sex and she reveals his true identity to him, saying that she is the powerful G-Girl superhero. After meeting her colleague and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the needy Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows the advice of his best friend Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson) and discharges her, breaking her heart. Jenny turns Matt's life into hell, while he has a love story with Hannah. However, the archenemy of G-Girl and Jenny's ex-girlfriend, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), suggests that Matt encourage Jenny to strip her superpowers. <br /> <br /> "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is deliciously silly and fun. This romantic comedy adventure has many hilarious moments and is a lot of fun. Luke Wilson is fantastic in the role of an idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a neurotic and neurotic superhero reminiscent of Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draper in "Play Misty For Me "". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
