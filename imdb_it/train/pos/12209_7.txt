I was very impressed by this small independent image. History, on a couple of social outcasts that meet, become friends and provide each other with a support system that seems to be missing as children, sometimes it's hilarious, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly with underground bands, has been used to great effect, as has experimentation with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. The shows (the protagonists are played by writers and directors of the film) are among the best I've seen in the last two years. If you ever feel forced to insert a square peg into a round slot, I really think you'll appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
