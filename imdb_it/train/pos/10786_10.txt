my sister and I use to rent this whenever we have movies and our parents get so angry (but they left us anyway) and I love it ... I can't find anyone who lives near me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm happy to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find it on DVD somewhere !! I would love to see this now, only I liked it as much as a child ... and I'm 15 now !!! I remember so much ... it's where I got the little bunny fufu song and all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think the little girl came sliding down the slide of her little play thing
