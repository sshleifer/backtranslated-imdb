This was an exceptional episode, one of the best of both seasons. Just horror for a change, with a story that is far above the average episodes of MOH, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car accident, in which he was driving. His airbag worked, hers didn't. It burned beyond recognition (excellent make-up) and didn't have many chances to live without a complete skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, he continues to die but is brought back by modern technology, and when he dies for a few minutes, his ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. The result is the massacre, and also some extremely bloody murders, and even some extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask for, could you ask? Well, not much, because this child has everything, and a very satirical ending, which should leave a smile on most faces. I also loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn), he has a great horror skill. Excellent episode, this is one I'm buying for sure.
