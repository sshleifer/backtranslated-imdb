the only word that sums up this film is bizarre. it is a carefree game through an existential concept. bouncy (more than one) and a little nutty. I wouldn't call it exactly like a grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem as memorable as the director's first "cube", but it's a good pit of hair to watch on Sunday mornings. acting turns from respectable to boring sometimes, but I think that's how it had to be written. done as a serious film may have been great or could have entered a state of claim. a bit like "the matrix" meets the "head" meets "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of 10
