You may not be interested in social commentary, or the point of view of filmmakers (I am confused myself by the insignificant angle that Kasdan seemed to promote, when clearly the actions taken in the film promote CERTAIN meaning. Ending confusing me) However, there is no denying the way history is presented; the magnificent symbolism in everything; the arcs of threaded character; graphics; dialogue ?? it is an absolute masterpiece. I've seen the movie dozens of times and I still marvel at its perfection. There is no moment, action, cut or line that has everything to do with the theme. Realistic human shows by all the actors. Scene by scene is intertwined in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> I have a pretty good standard meter. The buzzer was never shot during this film. If you are a thinker (rather than a random viewer) ?? this film offers. Exponentially. Absolutely fascinating. (Do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display? Who cares if it made you hot and blurry or not, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, did the film impress me? significantly. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: the reviewer on the front page clearly speaks of an imperfect African American perception. What maybe he failed to recognize is that there was a hand ?? tremble. Not a hand out. The spiritually dead white man, he simply saw a man respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that it was black had little, if anything, to do with it (the color is simply used to draw the parallel and the chasm. It is no coincidence that the opening sequence moves from black and white to color). If you see blacks in this movie as a "token" ?? you may want to re-evaluate your distress. Maybe you're just seeing yourself in black and white, eh. Just a thought.
