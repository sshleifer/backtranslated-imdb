This is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but had a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel. In other words, a lot of land to be treated. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was soap operish but it also had visually dramatic moments, crowned by an attack of locusts at the end of the film. It was incredible to see. Considering that this film is around 70 years old, the special effects troupe of this film has done a spectacular job. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors of their day and did not disappoint, both offering powerful performances. The only problem is credibility since all Asians are interpreted by Caucasians and some of them, like Walter Connolly, simply don't seem real. I'd like to see a re-make of this film with Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but simply to make the story more credible and seem.
