I saw it for the first time in 1975 on a German television channel and I was immediately captured, after watching this film about 12 times in theaters and today I have a videotape that I watch at least once a year - this film is excellent under every aspect (direction, acting, cut, musical score ...). The sets are exceptional and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating world war that begins in the late thirties seems like a prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "Everytown" is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is simply charming, believable and ideally chosen as "the hero". The positive tone towards technology and progress is rather refreshing according to today's usually pessimistic standards - especially the final scene that always brings a tear or two to my eyes, even after having seen the film so many times. <br /> <br /> goes well on TV but was created for the big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in some cinema. please, it's overwhelming.
