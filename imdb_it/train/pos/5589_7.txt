Dripping with symbolism and full of wonderful cinematography, Extase is much more than the erotic drama we all expect. This is almost a silent film, with which dialect there is in German and in very simplified German. Perhaps the directors wanted the film to reach the wider European public, since anyone with a minimum of high school, Deutsch, can safely give up the subtitles. The story has little importance, however, with the film that is successful in terms of cinema, not narrative. The symbols of fertility and the power of nature overwhelm human characters - there are also scenes in which flowers obscure the face of the alleged star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has some message to convey, I think it's political: the bourgeois man is shy and powerless; the working class man is a happy and productive creature; and the woman is the creator, destined to be dissatisfied until she has given birth to a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma does not overwhelm the film in any way - it is a beauty to look at from beginning to end - but it places it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedy took away his equipment.
