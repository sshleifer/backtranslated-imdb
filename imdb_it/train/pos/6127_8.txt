Jack Frost speaks of a serial killer sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence, the prison truck he rides collides with an oil tanker full of a chemical that turns his molecules with snow on the ground turning him into a snowman. Being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who captured him. Jack is now starting to unleash his fury by killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I don't think Jack Frost has the chance to become a horror classic but it's a fun movie. Put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but don't take it too seriously.
