I had heard positive things about this film and, you guessed it, a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is promised surprisingly well, surprisingly safe, at a young age; in reality all the (small) casts are quite solid, in their simple American setting of the 50s. The reason I didn't vote for this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the pain shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and that pulled me out of the movie a bit. Maybe we should compile the plot, or maybe the movie had to be a little longer. The character of Maureen is quite underdeveloped, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the youngest) is traumatized and angry, but why does her sister look more angry? Why do you have a few more years? Did the end not undermine the rest of the film? The rhythm of the film makes it appear that Maureen and Court have just met, when it is sketched (attention: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems that it may have tried to shock a little.. It depends on what you want - if you want the happy story of the girls of the young love that you seem to be getting, you're surprised. Man in the Moon is both bizarre and dreamy and a tough aging film is a rather embarrassing combination? Anyway, I liked it the character of Court, I can see what the girls watching are looking at, and I appreciated the fact that they had the courage to let him hurt his younger sister (most men, most of the movies wouldn't) and to be killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my rather hard rating scale For some reason I found Jason London funny on a tractor.
