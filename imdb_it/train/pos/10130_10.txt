The pilot is extremely well done. Describes how the characters connect in future episodes. I don't think anyone could have created a better driver for this show. Show remarkable creativity on the part of the writers. Although not everything was fixed because it was the first episode, many events that happened in the future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot. An example would be the future relationship of Ross and Rachels. Although the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overtaken by a surprising plot and an exceptional choice. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start for an unbeatable comedy!
