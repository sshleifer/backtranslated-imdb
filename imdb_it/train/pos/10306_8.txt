As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this film scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are also some parts with the TV news anchors of Buffalo's real life .. and, for once, don't knock on the area. Alleluia! <br /> <br /> Theology-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still made to look and think like humans ... and, of course, to be a little bit on the liberal side. Being the light comedy is, there is nothing that should win any prize, but it's still fun and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some ridiculous slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, the public - from Christians to atheists - has made something out of it besides some laughter, such as which prayer should really be. Congratulations to the writers for having at least corrected that theology and given a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good-hearted film that should offend very few.
