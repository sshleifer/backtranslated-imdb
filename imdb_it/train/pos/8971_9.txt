In general, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion films and RUKA didn't catch my attention at the beginning. However, knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the era of Soviet domination, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how subversive this little innocent-looking film was. This subtext really brought the film to life and gives it a real capacity for resistance both as a work of art and as a political statement. <br /> <br /> The sad film is made without any dialogue, but it is quite clear what is happening. A cute little wooden man is making an earthenware pot and having fun when suddenly an animated and destructive hand appears to destroy the vase, turning it into a sculpture of a hand instead. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to get rid of his hand and do his thing. However, over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and in the end it traps the man. And, in the end, the man died thanks to the ingested hand and the hand, as a sign of true hypocrisy, gives man the funeral of a hero! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his overbearing government. Not surprisingly, even though the Czechs adored the film and gave him critical praise, the state (ie the hand) banned this little parable. Sadly, Trnka did not live to see his nation freed a little more than twenty years later during the so-called "Velvet Revolution".
