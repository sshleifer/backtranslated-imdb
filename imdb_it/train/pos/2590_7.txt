The people who put a bad mouth to this film are the ones who don't understand the movie to begin with. These are the people who love blockbuster films and those who are averse to any film that does not have Leonardo DiCaprio as its protagonist. Wilder Napalm is a cute little film that may seem strange and maybe even stupid at first, but what is missing in the plot is more than compensated for in essence. <br /> <br /> Something in particular of the film that struck me in its use of music, which plays an important role. Those film music students will notice how important music is in the film, both in the life of Vida and Wilder, and in the background. Wilder's theme, Vida's theme and Wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and the way some of the lyrics are presented is fun. For example, in the scene where men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Wilder when men sing something like "She is my girl", and then approaches Wallace to give him something when men sing lyric "It will be my girlfriend "who skillfully shows the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of small complications like this in the film, and while it may seem like a flop outside, the real student of the film will notice how good this film is really.
