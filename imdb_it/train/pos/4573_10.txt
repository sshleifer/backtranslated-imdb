Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much you throw into each of the characters he plays making them real. <br /> <br /> I remember, many years ago, we had a party in our house - friends approached us, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having fun. The TV was on - there was a movie that we didn't pay much attention to. Then all of a sudden we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not tinkle, the forks did not move, the food became cold on the plates. We could not look away from the screen where the paralyzed young man whose whole body was against him and who had only one control on his left foot, picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed eternity he tried to write only one word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word, we all knew we hadn't witnessed only one three triumphs: the triumph of a will and a human spirit, the triumph of cinema that managed to capture the moment like this in the film, the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character. <br /> <br /> The "My Left Foot" by Jim Sheridan is a compelling, non-sentimental biogiramma about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a slum in Dublin; who became an artist and a writer and who found love for his life. <br /> <br /> I like all the interpretations of Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY) but I think his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My left foot"
