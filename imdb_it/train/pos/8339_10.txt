I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy in finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was better suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. However, all those involved in this film have done an absolutely exceptional job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy of finding the right person for you from any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who hasn't seen it. You are in for a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
