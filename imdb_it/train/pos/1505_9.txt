"The House That Dripped Blood" is one of the best anthology films of the period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Tracking down a missing movie star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) discovers that the last reported sighting was in a large country house. During the course of looking through the house, he is told four different stories about past residents. <br /> <br /> The good stories: Method for murder - Move to the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while Charles penetrates his latest masterpiece, the horror novelist Charles Hillyer, (Denholm Elliott ) and his wife Alice, (Joanna Dunham) are enthusiastic about the story, centered on a serial stranger named Dominic. After a series of strange accidents and experiences at home, Charles begins to believe that my creation has come to life and is persecuting him and his wife. Probably one of the best voices in the film, it is easily the most disturbing. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are really gruesome, the mystery that surrounds it is really effective and there is always a classic creep-out moment. The classic moment is the killing in the psychiatrist's office, which is a historic peak for creepiness. Accumulation, with creaking sounds, fast flashes of a mysterious being, and thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for the benefit of this. <br /> <br /> Sweet for sweets a new home, widower John Reid, (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton, (Nyree Dawn Porter) for her young daughter Jane, (Chloe Franks ) while away on business. Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past that John vehemently denies. When she learns the true nature of what happened, it is much more shocking than what she could have thought possible. With the most gruesome plot and the biggest turning point in the stories, this is a pretty pleasant voice. The mystery of the family is wonderfully played, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is downright unnerving. That part is the main reason this works, and Lee doesn't hurt either. <br /> <br /> The Bad Story (s): Waxwork - Tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a wax museum, while the statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts them both. There is a clever premise here, and it provides an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which is always disturbing. This is no exception, and it seems disturbing, which is helped by the fluorescent lighting on the sculpture show. A dream sequence offers a great moment of suspense, but what eventually kills this is the slow rhythm. It takes a long time before events occur and most of the time is spent on exposure. It also builds a final shock that can be seen from a mile away. Those really lower this a bit. If the turn was changed, it would have scored higher, the rest is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Cloak-Veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson, (Jon Pertwee) shocked by the lack of realism on the set of his new movie, turns off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store. The cloak soon turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with co-star Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampire acts at home. Not convinced that the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to show that it is only in his imagination. This has a pretty decent premise, and there are many opportunities for some decent scares, but what sinks is several factors. First, he is too stupid for his own good. The coup de theater at the end is a perfect example, which is so exaggerated that it is not a shock at all, and it simply looks like nonsense. There are so few scenes of fear or fear attempts that it's just a bore to sit. It is the weakest in the film. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: a fairly decent omnibus movie, there are a few small problems scattered throughout each of the stories that make it a film that is not perfect but still highly watchable. Highly recommended for those in similar films of the time or who love British horror movies. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG-13: Violence
