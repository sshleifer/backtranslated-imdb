Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensational this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director. <br /> <br /> The only truly flat note in this wonderful work is "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza, That's Amore," a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once too many ) and that continued to have a long life in the afterlife in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to marry and should not be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by offering them, offering her his pinky ring as a replacement for an engagement ring, then rushes to Sicily to be with his dying mother. Loretta embarks on seeing that her separated brother, Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta faces Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on his mother (Olympia Dukakis), whom Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything is resolved in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. Meanwhile, all the actors earn admirably and the public has fun. In its way, "Moonstruck" is the way Hollywood was at its best: having fun with fun without any social significance. If they had lost only "That's Amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.
