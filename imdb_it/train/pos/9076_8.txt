This should be one of the funniest TV sitcoms out of the States after the death of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always hilarious, and this completes the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his rather unique delivery of his lines. After thrilling the British series, "Coupling", I see where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" got their original idea, but this is not intended as a "brickbat" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way that is conveyed completely separates this particular series. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been part of a team of professional TV writers for the better part of 7 years in Australia, I can particularly appreciate the role of the director and the perceptive and creative talent of the TV crew. One of the few complaints I have had with the series is obviously the "canned" laugh. Surely a live audience could have been used in the series.
