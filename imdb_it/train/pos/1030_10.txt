I name this and BABYLON 5 as the best TV science fiction series ever made. Both come to mind because unlike the first STAR TREK series, there is a coherent evolution of graphics and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, they were good shows, but there was no theme or general story to link all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually watch the shows out of sequence without any difficulty understanding what is happening. This was less the case for DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up the entire final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more than one broader story that connected them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has seen it to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many respects this series was like seeing a family or a long novel take shape slowly. Of course, there were some "disposable" episodes that were not related to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were usually quite funny. <br /> <br /> And speaking of fun, I liked that SG -1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so terribly serious. In this way, I liked it a lot more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's really a pity he slowly faded from the series in the following seasons. <br /> <br /> To really appreciate the SG-1, you should look at it from the beginning and see how they complicate the plots. This consistency gives the show an exceptional capacity for resistance. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving a good chance, then science fiction is probably not the kind for you.
