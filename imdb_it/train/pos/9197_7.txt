This is actually a small, groovy-tidy film, made on a budget that cannot be distinguished with a crinkling video hit. It takes a while to warm up. The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen charm. After a few scenes, stop noticing the embarrassing lines or the proven sound of some deliveries. All the characters develop a bizarre charm, in particular "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I would hire to play a delirious psychopath. He seems to enjoy it so much! Mixed with the madness-gore and zombie infestation scenes are some really visually effective shots of the title character, "The Midnight Skater" that hurtles across the campus in a black sweatshirt, looking around the world like a cross between the Grim Reaper and, for example, Silver Surfer. These shots make the sometimes ridiculous things that the characters say about the Skater seem almost threatening. The soundtrack features some very funny Garage-Punk songs and the rough and raucous melody of it fits the mood of the movie perfectly. Thumb up, I say.
