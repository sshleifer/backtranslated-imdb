I'm not sure how I missed this when it came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of Japan's samurai code. <br /> <br /> It is solely Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he could direct this film, his adaptation to the script is obvious. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is renowned and sheds light on how these systems interact with each other. Characters can run around each other, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world to which it belongs. The samurai warrior who goes adrift in the world of the good and loving prostitute returns to his life, as he embarks on another road with a man who is part of his caste system .. the lowest of the low. Many reward the world of the samurai above all others, but nevertheless, they are the inhabitants of the lower castes who can support each other and who they can love without restraint. The samurai in this film turns out to be the weakest, while classmates turn out to be honorable. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. It is a story of survival of women in feudal Japan. During this period, it was thought that men were survivors ... strong ones while women were considered as properties lacking in intelligence and weakness. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to survive, and how their strength allowed Japanese culture to continue as it is. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The Sea is Watching" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not fans. It is a beautiful film, quiet and that supports the soul and one to keep in mind for any film collection.
