The year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not love people. There is only one friend who has and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an understanding old man. They are driving a cattle with them. their key to wealth. In Skagway they run into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff just has to go back and guide him across the Canadian US border to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with them, like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). The two men enter the world of gold business. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954) is a really good western. The acting job is superb. Walter Brennan is a fantastic companion of Stewart. Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is delightful. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in minor roles. It's great to see how Jimmy Stewart has overcome the problems he encounters. There is only the man and his gun. But he too is vulnerable.
