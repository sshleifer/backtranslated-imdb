It seems that this film is polarizing us. Either you love it or you hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s) he said, you just have to "hear" this. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting made by Monet - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small cups so closely the painting looks like a disaster, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise states that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I believe this is a suggestion for the viewer. This film is like that impressionist painting. It's an impressionist film! And it is no coincidence that the film's title refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It takes more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you will not always be sure of what is happening. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You'll have to focus on this movie, but I think people are making the mistake of focusing too much on it. After the end is when you should think about it. If you try to understand it while it is taking place, you will overwhelm yourself. Let that happen ... "go" with him ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the performances of the first order and I thought it was tremendously unique, incredibly creative and fascinating. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those of you who did not enjoy themselves. It appeals to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, stimulating and stimulating spiritual films, then see it. If you prefer something a little lighter, then jump. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I have described, then you will surely like it.
