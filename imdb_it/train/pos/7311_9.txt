Halloween is a movie that I have to go out and watch whenever it's that day of the year. Sometimes I watch it even when it's not the holiday !!! This movie is so beautiful. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress that I can never stop loving This movie could be old, but the plot always takes me there every time, and the acting was absolutely fantastic !!! Although I haven't seen the remake, I already feel that it was TOTALLY unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie should have NEVER redid a classic like that. What kills me though is knowing that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing about the original. I'm getting angry just thinking about it !!!!!! This film was great, and will always be remembered in history as a classic.
