I love this movie, at first the smooth graphics seemed strange with the grainy film, but I immediately understood. There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in reducing it. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be the movie for you, but here are some fantastic characters (and some real shooters). Technically I also liked it a lot, they must have used a new deinterlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the movie was so dark anyway, but I wasn't bothered by the usual artifacts seen in video and film transfers. (Open Water drove me crazy, especially because now progressive and inexpensive cameras are available and I don't see any excuse for not bombarding for one if you intend to project in the cinema). Sorry, this is my little joke. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious, I could be accused of laughing at other wretches but it's a classic piece.
