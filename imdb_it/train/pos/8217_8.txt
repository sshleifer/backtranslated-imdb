With this film, it's the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only performs, but produces and directs, you know it must be good. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best in the series, I don't agree at all. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with a couple of good action sequences, it doesn't have the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films make. This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good, and has quotes that make a Dirty Harry movie good. In Diry Harry is "... well, punk?"; in Magnum Force "A man must know his limits"; and in this it is "Go ahead, prepare my day". Also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery, while you get tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco in the other films of the series. With the great acting of Clint Eastwood and the co-star Sandra Locke, and the good direction of Clint, this is in my opinion the best sequel to Harry Potter ever.
