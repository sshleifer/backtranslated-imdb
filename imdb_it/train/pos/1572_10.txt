When I read a review by another user, saying it's a terrible game, I couldn't stay idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is fantastic, from the news (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), for the story, I find it very good! I complain only for the enemies that start flashing when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations in LEILA VR missions, when riding the bike, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Except, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, excellent characters, great soundtrack ... I recommend it! Of course! It can be a little old, but still enjoyable! At least, on Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
