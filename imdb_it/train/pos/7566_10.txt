The girl's name is Bonnie (Polay). He is attractive, apparently living a fairly decent life, but suddenly he is inexplicably torn from his home and life by Evil Dude and the various evil villains. Now he has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a group of heavily armed people apparently want her dead ... and he will die without even knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I always hear the whining. Now that the content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be no one to guarantee that there is a quality standard! We're going to drown in shit! The only people who actually think they are people who haven't seen any movies or who have read books recently - because we're already doing a dead man's punch. They are people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who lied to these ignorant e-sos throwing $ 8K on the table and doing ... well, what I would say is a better action movie than anything you've seen in theaters year. but you have not seen any action movies at the cinema this year. I saw the box office. Stay away in droves. You'd better grab a copy of this, spend twenty minutes enjoying yourself and get on with your lives. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. Come in, like Bonnie, with a lot of questions and where it all ends is hazy. The whole concept has been done before in many ways, but not in such a compressed amount of time and without a tasty, concentrated shooting. You're there for the atmosphere, the mystery and the weapons. That's it - it's all the filmmakers promise, and they deliver. <br /> <br /> Heat the black holes in my heart to think it was done with a similar budget. We've had a good number of independent films here, but we rarely see anything as polished as this short, and we've never seen one done in the action genre that was so beautiful. Hell, you could give these two guys MI: 3 and it could lure me to look at it. The Bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, better, better: I'd like to see these guys do a feature on their own and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever is out there killing the movie industry is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> The best indie we've seen in a while and the most effective independent business card we've ever seen. The DVD has $ 20 and has bonus features out of the ass. Go get your movie ticket budget and put it on this instead.
