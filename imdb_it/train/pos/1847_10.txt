Whatever you may become in your life, you must never forget to have roots. This is the story of true facts that have been transformed into a beautiful and moving film! I dare say that this film is undervalued. This shows us a reality of life ... the more evil surrounds you, the better person you become. Trust your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy ... without rancor, without living "under a rock". The concept of the film is more interesting ... connecting storytelling with real life events ... keeping us aware of everything ... from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! Look at it, I recommend it to all young people. This is not about racism, but about how to live your life!
