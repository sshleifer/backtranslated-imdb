This must be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine breathtaking cinematography with extraordinary acting and a compelling storyline, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog bitten by a dog made me squeeze the edge of my seat during some scenes, back away horrified during the others, and let me drown in my own tears after the tragic final. <br /> <br /> The film left a deep impression on me. They are incredibly violent scenes that contrast sharply with the poignant and hold scenes of "love". The film does not deserve the Cat III classification (nudity); there are no nude scenes, and the "love" scenes do not even include kissing or "getting out". <br /> <br /> The message that this film gave me? All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side. Edison Chen does a great job playing the part of the deadly Pang. <br /> <br /> Rate this movie 10/10. It is a must-watch.
