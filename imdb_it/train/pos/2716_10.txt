All I remember was excellent ... great cast with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before it became more familiar to the American public) .... excellent scripts as only the English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type mysteries, but with a touch of Jules Verne. A kind of MacGyver would have been if he had been in England 80 years earlier ... right at the beginning of the scientific / technological revolution of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> I often wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver first aired about 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a very deteriorated tape.
