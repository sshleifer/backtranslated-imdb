Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with Oscar-winning "Gandhi", back in '83. I didn't know any of his other work until I came across "Cry Freedom", released in 1987. Although he may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, he is just as compelling, if not more, and released when South Africa had not yet gotten rid of the apartheid chains. While most films on social themes come out after the event happened, I believe this was released over time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on characters and events from real life. The book on which the film is based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the end of the seventies. Trace the origins of Woods' friendship with charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is wonderfully played by Denzel Washington. I can't imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and a presence on the screen, which required the character of Biko. While initially, Woods was against what he felt to be the black racism spread by Biko, after meeting the man, he could not help but be drawn into his struggles and ideas. The bond between them is strengthened and Woods and his family realize and become more sensitive to the difficult situation of the people that Biko represents. <br /> <br /> However, finally, the tragedy strikes and Woods must now concentrate on his escape from South Africa, with his book, so that he can publish it and let the outside world know what is happening. The second part of the film is a compelling story of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and will keep you foiled. <br /> <br /> There are also deliciously funny dialogues. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example. Lawyer: do you defend violence? Biko: I support a comparison. Lawyer: Well, isn't that violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: not necessarily. You and I are having a fight now, but I don't see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before common sense prevailed. The scene in which the army opens fire on a protest from school children is heartbreaking and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is a must-look. I would suggest to those who are not familiar with Attenborough's work, take a break for it. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are films that make life. Every day I would prefer the latter.
