My mother and I were coming home from a trip to the North East (mainly Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour to attend a film festival in Boston. Now, I don't know much about the movie, so I thought it might be a bit educational. The first movie we saw was this, THE DIVISION ROMEO. Now, I don't know about you but I thought it was great! I come from Texas and where I come from we don't see too many moving images, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted he was too violent, but said that I didn't know much about what he was saying, but this was a great image. I was shocked by the great fighting sequences. Also, I'm a big fan when good guys win so I was thrilled when Romeo's ladies killed all the bad guys. This was true splendor. I'm not sure when it will be released on video, but if you can, you should try it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word for the essay, however, is rather violent and there are many words of curse, so you may not want to let your children watch. It's more for adults.
