Even if you're not a big Ramones fan, Rock 'N' Roll High School is * still * the biggest rock 'n roll movie ever made. Why? Because under all the carefree, he treats with respect the contempt and hatred that adolescents often feel (and rightly so) for the boring, stupid, fascist and established world of adults. That final scene is one of the most glorious and exciting final scenes of a film I've ever seen. "My eyes saw the glory of ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
