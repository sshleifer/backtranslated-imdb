I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was well done, from cinematography to acting. It is the story of a father and a son, and how they appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written in a dialogue that never sounds fake, the film shows the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this exceptional cast. The film begins with the aging of his father (Peter Falk) is trying to understand why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. The father appears, without warning, on the threshold of his son and his daughter-in-law. The father and son take off the next day to look at some properties and end up making a classic road trip. They fish, play billiards, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a bar fight, and dance with strange women. But more importantly, each of them faces the unspoken coughs that can affect any family. It is the kind of film that touches the heart and makes those who are closer to them appreciate it.
