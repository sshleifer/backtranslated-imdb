Am I the only one who saw the connection between the discussion about the "myth of sisyphus life" and the life of Mary? in camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant boulder that must roll up a hill. unfortunately, every time it reaches the top, the boulder slips and ends up on the bottom to start. there may have been a buzzard pecking at his eyes, I'm not sure now. in the movie Mary spends her life struggling to get her life together, unfortunately whenever she earns any position she falls and loses everything. case in question would be the party she throws where she gets drunk, offends her falafel lover, and is practically attacked by Liev Schrieber. In the event that this theory is questioned, note how this scene ends with his attempt to climb a star gush while the books fall out of nowhere preventing his progress until she finally faints. the next morning, when he wakes up, he is still on the stairs, never having reached the top.
