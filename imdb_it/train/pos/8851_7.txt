While the title "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" comes from an Irish proverb, the film looks like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a battered robbery and continues to spiral out of control when two brothers try to escape the disaster in which they are hunted. <br /> <br /> The cast is well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. Remarkable support includes Albert Finney as father and Marisa Tomei as wife of a brother and lover of the other. Beyond these principles, acting is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts. That being said, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat attenuated since it soon appears that this story is a tragedy, uninterrupted. All in all, a rather impressive debut for the screenwriter for the first time Kelly Masterson. <br /> <br /> The management of Sidney Lumet is well managed, but I am more impressed by the fact that he has been running for more than eighty years. I was less impressed by Carter Burwell's soundtrack, but it's not a major distraction. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film proves to be compelling and while the story and the presentation may have superficial similarities with other films this remains a unique experience.
