I was speechless and devastated after my first vision of this - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - no documentary, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the Weirdsville lotteries. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically far beyond the eccentric) reveal their very humanity in the most amazing way, and I wonder if their retreat from the world was motivated by anything beyond the rigidity of life in the unreal blue blood of the universe, perhaps a bit of abuse, or perhaps simply a strip of challenge and rebellion that has come out of their control and has taken on a life of its own. This could be one of the greatest films ever to come close to exploitation dangerously, without going beyond the limits - while the Edies do their thing, I kept noticing things like empty gin bottles in the bedroom strewn with rubble, cats urinating on the bed, the raccoons that emerge from the holes in the walls and the final scene looked incredibly sad - like a birthday party for a child that went seriously wrong. Definitely worth seeing and looking for - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
