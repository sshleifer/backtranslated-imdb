Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. I think we can all try for "Gypo" because we have all struggled with what is right and what is not and what is wrong. This was one of the first author's photos to be published by a major American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its best here. However, the splendid portion of August was mostly neglected; did not receive the Oscar nomination he deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all transmitted with the least possible words.
