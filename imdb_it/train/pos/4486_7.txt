SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon, with an impeccable idea, and almost every single short is a jewel. While I have to say that this is definitely a shorter short compared to other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, there's no way you can hate this cartoon. Of course, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say I agree, but the fact is that all the episodes of Tom and Jerry are fantastic, but some are just better than others. Well, this would fit with "the others". <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom is listening to an old scary radio show and becomes easily scared. Jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. Create scary dilemmas for Tom, and Tom becomes frightened by his wits and his lives. Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and checks it, making it look like the void is a ghost. Tom discovers that Jerry did all this and pursues him. Tom then accidentally bites the waitress. However, in the end, Jerry ends up becoming a scared after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry, but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time. I'm glad there are more cartoons like this. The slapstick and the gags that make Tom and Jerry look better than ever in this short, but it seemed like something was missing in this one. He seemed slower than most of Tom and Jerry's shorts. However, this is a good short film that is not up to the standards of other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
