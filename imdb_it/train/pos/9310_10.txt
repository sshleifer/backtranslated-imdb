wow, how can I discuss this movie without tears in my eyes? It was definitely the highlight of my year - indeed - my life. As if the raptor graphics weren't surprising enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the film, even when the background didn't actually match the setting of the scene. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of plot holes (for example, some clips of a t-Rex type animal where it should be a raptor and a key moment in which Pappy finds a torture chamber, he shouts "Colin is a girl!" And it ends) I will never forget the genius of Raptor Planet. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
