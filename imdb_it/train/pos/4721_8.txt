Sad story of a downed B-17 driver. Brady is shot down on the occupied territory. Local breeders extended kindness and protection at the expense of their lives. I had never heard of this movie and it blocked me for two hours. After the movie is finished, I'm glad I took the time. It's all a story told to explain the look on Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
