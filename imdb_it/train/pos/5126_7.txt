For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen. He's a pretty decent kid who leaves his parents' farm and hits the big city of Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him working in the petrochemical industry. The boom was beginning in 1980 and Texas was definitely a growing place in the United States. Travolta does a good job of getting the public to care about his character when he comes down is a sexist pig Meet and marry Debra Winger, who has the same story, but has some idea that women shouldn't be shadows of their men . And when he beats him against Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's all for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, a former prisoner, works at Gilley and this film was his starring role. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets Travolta's goat with a simple look and approaches Winger. Travolta, in turn, makes fun of a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne who is staggering from Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really a huge advertisement for the biggest honky tonk in the world. Gilley's is no longer in the Texas suburban community of Pasadena, but the memories survive. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful soundtrack of country / western songs that were featured in the film. I'm not sure that some of the songs weren't written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but it's the only reason I can think about why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. I particularly liked Johnny Lee's Looking for Love, if it was written specifically for this film, it is a disgrace that he was not nominated for the best song. I liked the character of Debra Winger the best in this movie. He does not lose a trace of femininity, but gets up from Travolta and does so in style. And this review is dedicated to that still unknown woman who will one day be the first female bull-rider in professional Bull Bulls.
