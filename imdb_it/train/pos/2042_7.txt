STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Okay ** You could go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Stupid bitch of career Kate (Franka Potente) he heads for the London Underground to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a hectic day of work, he falls asleep and wakes up to find himself alone on a deserted platform. While running on a situation that leads her from a daunting encounter to the next, however, she learns something much more wicked and evil than she's waiting for out there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British The film industry is really becoming a reality apart, especially in the horror thriller department, with films like Creep and the lucky 28 Days Later (which has strong echoes of set off). In terms of success in what it set out to do, Creep deftly creates (especially at the beginning) a fearful sense of isolation and tense fear. In his time of intelligent execution, even (though inadvertently, I suspect) he is able to pay tribute to some of those pioneering high-profile horror films of the 70s that are based on shock and fear without focusing too much on character development and on these . <br /> <br /> Of its weaknesses, some scenes are a bit predictable, but these really fail to make it less scary or effective in any way. I'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it look like a kind of morality and it's not exactly perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves its basic function very well. ***
