I'm watching the series again now that it's on DVD (yay!) It strikes me as cool, relevant and intriguing as when it first aired. <br /> <br /> The central performances are compelling, the scripts are layered. <br /> <br /> I will pull myself out of my neck and put it there with The Prisoner as a show that will win new fans and be watched again in 2035. <br /> <br /> I was asked to write some extra line (it seems that IMDb is stubborn user and codent retentively as always! Pithy and to the point it is clearly not the IMDb mode.) <br /> <br /> Well, unlike the authors of the publications of IMDb, American Gothic understand that simplicity is everything. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the show covers a greater development of the character than many shows in seven seasons. On top of which the personal ethics and the strength of the character are questioned in a way that challenges the viewer at every turn to ask what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the show first, I was still saddened by Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap twist. Personally I am starting to evaluate it more thoroughly and I suspect that I will get better over the years. He thinks it's no more controversial than that!
