Very nice dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head out of the water after finishing the ideas. I can't say much about this film without giving the story away. I can say that that little was how it looks like you are looking at the image. Everyone has their own agenda. Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performance from everyone.
