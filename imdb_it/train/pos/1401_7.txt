Ok, we have the extreme violence of Verhoeven (though not as extreme as the other Verhoeven films), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, Paul Verhoeven's intelligence is missing for in science fiction film. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and their sense of humor, but unlike most of Verhoeven's films, the film itself doesn't have enough humor to make it fall into the comedy genre. The overall acting was above average compared to most slasher movies. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good film is not the story, not the cast or the characters, but the fantastic special effects that would otherwise make a film so impossible The crew has indeed created an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects on the set). The most incredible effects scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, they are when Kevin Bacon is becoming invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this story of an invisible man deserves to be more imaginative. Here, it takes place in a laboratory for the most part. I would have liked to have seen the invisible Kevin Bacon rob a bank and get away with it, or say we steal something from people's bags, or something. But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man a funny movie. Degree: B
