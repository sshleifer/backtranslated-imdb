Girlfight is like your grandmother's kitchen: the same old recipe you've tried a million times before, but somehow turned into something fresh and new. Try to explain the story to people who have never seen it before: a young woman on the wrong side of the tracks tries to improve her situation by picking up boxing while confronting a bitter and obstructive father and her growing attraction for a male rival. Look at them as they roll their eyes towards the row of clichés, and they're right: it's * cliché. Yet I was mesmerized by the way this film works, due to the often superb acting and dialogue and the sensitive direction that makes it "new". I avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap, but I didn't make the same mistake I made. Definitely worth a look.
