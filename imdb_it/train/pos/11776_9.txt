"Hare Conditioned" by Chuck Jones is a fast and often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange director of the yellow-skinned apartment shop who wants to have it stuffed, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose environment. The chase brings Bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing any outfit associated with that part of the store. This big gag is still truncated by a really inspired sequence that involves the elevators in which Bugs, disguised as a lift boy, makes sure that the store manager enters and goes down non-stop at the wrong time. It is a brilliant scenographic set which unfortunately gives way to a final gag that is not very funny. At that time, however, "Hare Conditioned" left its mark as one of the great hunting films, full of wild energy. While Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons of that period, "Hare Conditioned" showed that he could still be attractive as a more anarchic character.
