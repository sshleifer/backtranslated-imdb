There have been several films on Zorro, some even made in Europe, eg. Alain Delon. This role was also played by exceptional actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all time has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at his end. The serial also has a good performance by various actors in films like Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a great performance by Hadley as Zorro. He was fast, clever, he used his whip and his sword well, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
