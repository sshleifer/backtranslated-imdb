I didn't expect Gackt and Hyde's shows to be as comfortable as they were, nor did I expect them to be screened in such a well-developed and artistic film with enough storyline to get you interested and enough diversity to make it original. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I'll be looking for the next movie like this. I especially like the fact that it's a vampire movie, but it wasn't a movie about cheese vampires, nor did it beautify it. The characters all had human traits. The way he shows the growth of the characters has been incredibly tasteful and makes you feel really sorry for them for life. I give this movie two inches so high. Definitely the best film I've seen in the last five years.
