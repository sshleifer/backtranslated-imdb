Do not believe all the negative reviews received from this film. Yes, it's cheap. Yes, blood is ridiculous. And, yes, acting is sub-par. However, this is a textbook example of a slash movie from the first hour, and if this is your "thing" (it's mine!), Then you'll like this one. There are enough good aspects in this film to make up for more of the disadvantages. For one, the soundtrack of a then unknown Christopher Young is very disturbing and perfectly accentuates the violence. The ending is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic endings of most films. And last but not least, the setting is what made the film for me. The creators of this film could have done a much better job "dressing" the set to make it more credible as a university dorm. However, if this defect is overlooked, the setting is excellent. Four colleagues all alone in an immense abandoned building, condemned, waiting to be knocked down ... it's a possibility. When you look, you allow your imagination to do some work and you could enjoy this movie as much as I do.
