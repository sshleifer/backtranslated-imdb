This is a great movie. I love it more every time I look. Most comedies can get quite lame because you know all the gags, but mysterious men have so much integrity in writing and characterization that they look again - while Ben Stiller rips off the limo hood ornament, or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his choreography by fuhrer, or Tom Waits mumbles while watching the news, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. This is a perfect acting together. The plot develops in a direct and coherent way, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups are rewarded in the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't, start it. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the audition scene. Too many good things!)
