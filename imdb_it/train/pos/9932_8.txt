If you go to this movie waiting for something that is not, you will be disappointed, as in any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as "the iceberg effect". On the surface, it's simply a cache of random movies broken together to make a movie. If this were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the film is very fast and, unless you actually try to take it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very much well pass you. Definitely a movie that you will have to see twice to fully appreciate it. Experimental cinematography barely describes this film. The work with the camera and post production adds a lot to the general taste of the film, making it rather artistic in some places and open to interpretation by others (something to be desired in American films in recent times). Even if, in some parts, it could become a bit vulgar, macabre and too heavy for an audience, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film that I would like to write as "needs improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. No film is ever good without a suitable soundtrack, and even if the soundtrack is quite suitable, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronics would have made this movie a real journey). The flooding of images and dynamics ... color palettes adds another "artistic" aspect to it, even in combination with the events that occur during the film, this is not a film of which we can leave out a part and which we can still understand. However, this also makes it much more a desirable movie to watch, and not one that you will soon be bored with. 8.5 / 10
