When a small hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the magician Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. If the ring ends up in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy the Middle Earth. Frodo and his faithful friends have begun a search to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. This is an underrated adaptation of classic novels in that it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is superbly crafted with rotoscope, which is tracking on live footage. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. The film also boasts a soundtrack by Leonard Rosenman that fits every scene. There are some holes in the plot with the script, but this must be justified, considering that the original agreement was to make the book trilogy into two films, much to be filled in the first. My biggest gripe is the character's design, Samwise was a bit stupid, while the other hobbits behave completely normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually a little more useful for the plot. Rotoscopied orcs are more comical than scary, while Ringwraiths are scary and nightmarish. Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would have done a lot of justice, but there is something fascinating about it. Ralph Bakshi has made a bold effort to adapt the screen of these classic stories. The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by live action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
