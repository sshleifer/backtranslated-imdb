This film tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From the careful descriptions of crime scenes to the mental health of the principal investigator, you will be enchanted. It is absolutely not to be missed for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol reports and the way agencies work together are also great. Not even excessively. I recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history, too. How the police work with the political party is what it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are nice. It's been a while since I saw this movie for the first time. Does not diminish the impact. Not overly dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough to the imagination, well, you'll see.
