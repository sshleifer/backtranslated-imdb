I have just returned from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and I am surprised to find a negative comment on the film. Basically the fault lies with Coccio who makes an easy and exaggerated social message ... well, Mr-I'm-a-reviewer, he's an easy critic and overplay movies with a social cost. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a school similar to that of these guys. Reject and ignorance in the menu. The thing is ... I understand how young people can be guided to do this horror. High schools have become conformity battlegrounds. It's a bad view. You have to struggle to become like others. It is difficult to explain, some people do not understand that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents are closing their eyes and smiling that their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real reason for the film is not about what is driving them. This is a quiet suburb similar to death and everyone closes their eyes and try to create this atmosphere of a perfect city. Cal expressed it well. It's an alarm clock. Drama is everywhere and can take any form. In this case, small dramas (like Andre, who is called a fagot for wearing a J.C Penny shirt) are turning into the worst nightmare of an entire city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. The malaise of discord in an age where you need more than ever to be like others to accept. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the last scenes in which some guys are burning Andre & Cal's crosses, as if with the pain they communicated, Cal & Andre communicated their blind rage to their community, the they refuse to think about the causes of certain acts. <br /> <br /> It might seem as aggressive as a movie, but Coccio is meditating rather than complaining or enunciating. What Andre & Cal is experiencing is a reality ... and a scary thing that could reach other children. <br /> <br /> The disturbing film ... The home production and the strong feeling make Ben Coccio a very disturbing film.
