Here is a rare gem for those of you who have not seen or most likely not even heard of this. During the 1980s, Dennis Quaid was a hot product, but in the early 1990s Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all unfortunately bombarded. I really enjoyed two of those films, and let me elaborate on one of these. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who are ... fire starters: yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder decided to stop using his power (for something not useful anyway) after a fatal accident during his youth, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house that killed a man who was inside the unsuspected to them. Today Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the extravagant Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest for, guess what, arson (watch the movie to understand it better). Wilder also did not speak with Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party. Wallace loves his pyrotechnic power and uses it for fun. He also runs a carnival and is the head clown. When the Carnival arrives in the city of Wilder, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and to see also Vida, of which Wallace has been in love! Vida's house arrest sees her end, but Wilder is worried. So, Wallace intervenes and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fight fire with fire! <br /> <br /> Some great fireball that he throws in this movie ... eat your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The film also has some really strange, but amusing elements, like Wilder's fire unit singing acapella songs during gunfights and after protections. Jim Varney (globally known as "Ernest") appears as Wallace's carnival companion. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliantly filmed ... and cleverly put together ... very far from the wall and cutting edge. <br /> <br /> Give this a look ...
