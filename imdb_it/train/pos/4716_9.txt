This film is simply too funny, a totally non-PC gangster game. If Mel Brooks had taken a picture of the Mob in the 1930s, it probably would be. Too many big one-liners to remember, and even if it's not for everyone, those who don't laugh a lot of times don't have a wrist. So wear it and REPLY to Iceholes !!!
