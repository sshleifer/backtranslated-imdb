"Shower" is a story about loyalty, the unstoppable advance of the modern world at the expense of rather traditional and more human ways of life. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his life as a big city, his wife and his late young brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern China against the ancient. The public baths with its meetings, its cricket fights against the malls and the skyscraper. Many old people and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... even if one of them is killing the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, moving, full of funny moments and sweet and very sweet. The most sensitive will cry and laugh the same way. The actors are enormous, especially the one who plays the role of the retarded boy; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy, simple, letting the story flow by itself. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10
