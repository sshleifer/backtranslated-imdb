We have high expectations with this. . . because his Zombi 3 is the official sequel of Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However . . . is co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and his shot in the Phillimines as Night of the Zombies and looks like Night of the Zombies (Hell of the Living Dead) a lot. consequently it is more like a companion of Hell of the Dead dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis who produced Zombi 2 and his publisher Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 its magic. . . Zombi 3 is not magical. . . it's like a peanut butter sandwich and jelly without peanut butter. But over the years, I've learned to accept Zombi 3. I could have sworn I saw a version in which a soldier was bitten by the arm and went to the hotel room. . . there was a senseless Fulci cut and the Mattei / Fulci cut is on DVD.
