This is a CGI animated film based on a French 2D animated series. The series lasted briefly on Cartoon Network, but his run was so short that his inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for best animated film this year left most of the people I know going " Huh? " This is the story of Lian-Chu, the type of heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, who along with Hector, their fart-burning dragon, is more like a dog. Travel the world offering their services as dragon hunters but never get paid. In their life comes Zoe, the fairy tale that loves the niece of a king who is becoming blind. It seems that the world has been devoured by a huge monster and all the knights that the king sent have never returned or if the return is returned as ashes. In desperation, the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe obviously tag along ... <br /> <br /> What else can I say then why this movie is hiding under a rock? This is a really good little movie that is completely off the radar except as an unlikely Oscar contender. It's a beautifully designed and fantastic-looking film (The world that takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly made me go "Wow". The English Voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (I think Steve Bucsemi) is top notch. Equally large is the script that does not speak to the public, using some real expressions that are not normally heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). It's all very well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits go on too long, but at the same time it's damn funny. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it. It is one of the best animated films of 2008 and is going to my beautiful surprise list for 2009.
