"The Man in the White Suit" is another flagship of the experienced Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore!, Sweet Smell of Success). The protagonist of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings his usual lesson in the film, and makes it much more than a typical comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy is not entirely obvious. At the end of the image, it has almost become a complete drama. It's the kind of comedy from Ealing's studio that isn't calculated to produce laughter, but a sense of general amusement, like the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the suit is not very original, but the way it is run is. The film is very original and recommended to all fans of Guiness or Britsh comedy. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
