My observations: post-war hilarity. Tom Drake and grandfather of "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Charming and cute Donna Reed. Margaret Hamilton is as good as ever; smaller part than in "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington's fashion was prettier, even with the itchy little brisk little face devoid of Hamilton. The tent scene at the end with the ex-boyfriend next door was hilarious. Being a two-year veteran of Army tents, he looked quite young and inexperienced when I looked him in the eye. <br /> <br /> I worked in a department store, and it was as elegant as this. Unfortunately, he disappeared and faded into darkness. We were famous for those large windows that were used to attract passersby to the store, to convince them to buy all that wonderful merchandise. <br /> <br /> 10/10
