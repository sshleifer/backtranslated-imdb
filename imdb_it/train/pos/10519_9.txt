I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and besides being a feature film (a real fan wants to see the minimum left out possible and that can only be achieved in a miniseries) it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the rich girl, a little naive but well-intentioned, and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightly with his elegance and nobility. I wasn't thrilled with Ewan McGregor, although I really like him as an actor but I don't think he ruined the film. As I said, as a Jane Austen fan there were things I wanted to see included that weren't, but that would have made it a lot longer than a feature film allowed and since I felt like they really encapsulated the story well. I saw every adaptation of this book and felt it was the best!
