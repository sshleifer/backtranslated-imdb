Many of these other viewers complain that the plot has already been attempted. It might be so, but the addition of the narrator and the Dr.Suess scenario makes this show absolutely worth watching. With adult insinuations throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is both reminiscent and invigorating. The investigative part of the show is not what drives viewers. The twisted plot and the lines of love scattered in this apparent paradise are what make faithful viewers come back more. This is a success that ABC should never abandon. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old, the way to revitalize in the early evening. 9 episodes before the writers hit the public on the left who wants more.
