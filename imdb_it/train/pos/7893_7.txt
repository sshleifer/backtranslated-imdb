I think I'm part of the silent minority that appreciated this film. Is it one of the best in the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I enjoyed it a lot. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil and witty potential. Since parts 4 and 5 slowed the series, I heard that this so-called "last episode" ("New Nightmare" is the real ending) brought the series out of its slump. There are some nightmare sequences, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a saxophone that is swept away, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is an extremely original and fun sequence, especially when we see it outside the dream landscape, hopping like Super Mario. And Freddy belts the funny cover, "Great graphics". And since the film was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started to control the game with Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb. Lisa Zane is perfectly thrown on the head. I didn't see Yaphet Kotto from "The Running Man", and I think the last time I saw that movie was about 5 years ago. He is another great undervalued actor who has a powerful on-screen presence. And who can forget the cameos? The best is from Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") who plays a spokesman for an anti-drug advertisement. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really fantastic! So for those who are trying to control this movie - please rent it or buy it on DVD! We hope that all editions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the 3D edition has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> Personally I have not seen many things wrong in the film. He also elaborated on Freddy's background. The film is a great mix of humor and fear, and the gross effects are fantastic. Could this give more justice to the franchise? Of course he could have. But Rachel Talalay did a great job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And in closing, I loved the editing on the opening credits. Fans of the series will be happy and will consider it a tribute to the beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
