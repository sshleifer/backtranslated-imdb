I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my favorite is John. I already knew a little of the Beatles 'music and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul Wings' band. I was curious to see how this film would handle the relationship between John and Paul many years after the breakup. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references used by the two musicians were very accurate. These included the way Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever he went, the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" was the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios that played from the "Let It Be. " <br /> <br /> The actors did a great job playing John and Paul. The accents might have used a little more work, but they seemed to behave as if I had read the two ex-Beatles. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. <br /> <br /> The ending at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it, especially since this was how it really went in real life. They also show the fantastic "Saturday Night Live" scene in which the Beatles offered $ 3,000 to perform on the show. (Compared to the $ 220 million that others offered them) Overall, I wasn't disappointed with this movie. It really gives you an idea of ​​why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back together.
