Okay - I'll confess it. This is the film that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody of someone who parodies James Cagney with his charm. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is made up of solid workers, and will do his duty and do a great job in this 80s comedy. A parody of the gangster films of the '30s and' 40s, it constantly opens up new paths, with extraordinarily original material. (Well, yes - some of these have been copied since then - but when this film was made, it was original, and many of these were not copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warns people not to do ______, with one of the best slogans of parody. Watch Roman Moronie do things with English words that would make your spinster teacher laugh. Watch the miraculous gags, like the pet shop owner Johnny Kelly who uses the price tag pistol on his puppies and dusts his puppies. Watch the biggest educational "warning against sex" movie ever made. Watch the most unbelievable misunderstanding of the Latin church done, while a boy who has never attended a shop class mounts a Thompson machine gun from parts. Look at the lines you will use in a casual conversation for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis with the hardworking mom, with a surprise gag you'll never see coming. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone, be patient - another will come in 30 seconds or less, and chances are, you'll need to pause until you're done with roll on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? They too. Look at the subtle things - some of the gags seen can go unnoticed the first few times. <br /> <br /> There are some minor flaws - but it's probably the best swear word. Some approach, but none of them is good enough.
