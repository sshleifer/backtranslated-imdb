This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens, Liverpool, and was the UK's response to films like "Blackboard Jungle". The film resists the test of time quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film presents some excellent performances by some well-known British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool policeman assigned to youth connection tasks, with the premise that if you catch children at an early age, they will end up being responsible adults. <br /> <br /> The major cameos in the film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real brothers and sisters) who are involved in a network of arsonists. Tsai Chin still performs and can be seen in Nicole Kidman's latest film 'The Interpretor'. <br /> <br /> Violent Playground has a weapons siege in a school, so it's unlikely to be shown on TV after similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the film was shot (although it wasn't born at the time), and I have good memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens which includes excerpts from "Violent Playground" and a small English film "Coast to Coast" with Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The buildings were demolished in 1987 and the films help keep the memory alive. <br /> <br /> There were some complaints from residents when the film was released, as the film represented the area in a bad light. Time has helped to heal those wounds. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie, I would recommend you look for it
