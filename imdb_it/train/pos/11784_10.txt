As has been well documented by the previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS - and, in fact it is the sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Don't you know who I am? I am the House Band, formidable, tight and rock-house, whose talent and musical talent have made this show something more than a sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the "bows" evening? It was musical precision and perfection, if I had ever seen it. Suzie McNeil's epic interpretation of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody", the memorable cover of Ty Taylor's "You Can Not Always Get ...", JD Fortune singing "Suspicious Minds". The common denominator here is the impressive House Band. <br /> <br /> As the INXS were in their full glory, they are sadly a shadow of their ex-selves, even though JD's live performances have somehow given new life to their music, this show is everything on HB. <br /> <br /> Reminder for the producers: the third season (if we're lucky enough to make it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Give those kids a good singer and they're going to places.
