The starrer of Alec Guinness is a very funny and entertaining political satire of the business sector, and also a study of eccentric lightness. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of them is really revolutionary - on the fun type plane, except perhaps the sound effects for experiments. But he has his funny moments, and he is very skilled in his execution. The large segment of the explosions is probably the most farcical element. <br /> <br /> The merge procedures are quite funny, very similar to I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; in particular the female socialist with a slight romantic crush on the character of Guinness. Political machinations actually bring history. Ernest Thesigner is remarkable as a heavy man. <br /> <br /> I don't think this works as well as the LADYKILLERS, or the TYPICAL HEARTS AND THE CORONETS; but even the light comedy of Ealing is better than nothing.
