This is a military drama that I really like! Tom Berenger plays the military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine has nothing to say, and asks no questions to people who do the work. There you have Billy Zane ("The Ghost" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT D.C. module, works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two are paired, the sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other sniper strikes, it is an ingenuity against ingenuity, a cat against a mouse, a gunman against a hit man. And when the sniper is captured, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when you are a professional like Beckett, has taken orders from no one but himself, plays with the rules and not with the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the policy. The film was a direct success. Watch it. Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
