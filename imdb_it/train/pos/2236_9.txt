The thing I remember most about this film is that it was aired on the local KTLA TV (Ch. 5) during each Christmas season between the mid and late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the real story took place at Christmas Eve or so. It was always a little disturbing to see the hell this girl goes through, being the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this little girl who pulled the leeches from her infected leg made a good impression on this young spectator. Not the kind of Christmas cheer I used to see at the time. It is certainly not a Rankin Bass production.
