In this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film also returns before Simba and (presumably) immediately after Kiara's birth. <br /> <br /> Very faithful to the first film, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)" is a fun, funny, exciting and surprising film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it) . A bundle of surprises and hilarity await you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a movie at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have a discussion about what point in "The Lion King" they will begin to watch, while Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa enter and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning They have a very honest compromise of watching the film of their story, which is what awaits ... Start with Timon's first home ... <br /> <br /> For anyone with a good sense of humor who liked early movies of almost all ages, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
