For the life of me, why did this film receive an R? Score! While it is carnivorous zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good movie for families - at least if your kids are at least 10 years old. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional, if somewhat twisted, values! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the style of the film is decidedly geared towards children (very similar to the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - yet some knuckleheads slapped an R rating! Believe me, most children have seen worse violence than this and it seems foolish to make the public believe that this is an adult-only film. <br /> <br /> The story is set in a parallel world. While fashions, machines and costumes appear around 1953, in this bizarre world there was a fierce zombie epidemic that caused the "zombie war" and enormous changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed combat and there is a cute scene in the film where the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case"! As far as life outside of school is concerned, it is also rather strange, given that now people have learned that zombies ARE NOT such a bad thing! Heck, using shock and training collars, they can be turned into slaves who can do housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick boy, be your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This film is about a particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). The mother is excited and her son slowly becomes the friend of the zombies. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - as he was forced years before to kill his own zombie father and has not yet passed this !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this film must be seen by a much wider audience.
