Every now and then this film is released that no one has ever heard of and shot in a very short time with very little money and resources, but everyone goes crazy and turns out to be surprisingly great. This also happened in the 1950s with some small films, of which not many have ever heard of. There are really some surprising and surprising little jewels from the 1950s that are worth digging. "Panic in the Streets" is another film like the one that comes to mind. Both are films that are not quite like the usual genre films of their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised at how much I ended up enjoying this movie. It was really a movie that was getting better and better as it progressed. Like all "old" movies, it tends to start slowly, but once you get into the story and the characters you're in, this movie is really interesting. <br /> <br /> The film has a really fantastic story this implies espionage, even if the film does not start like that. It starts like this typical thriller thriller with a touch of film noir. But "Pickup on South Street" is not really a movie by number, so start taking your directions very soon. It guarantees that the film remains surprising but above all also refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also really like the characters in this movie. None of them is really good and all their flaws and weaknesses. Really human. In particular, it also presents a great performance by Thelma Ritter, who also received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for. It must really be one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even if it's a pretty obvious budget, this is simply a small, original, special film that deserves to be seen more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
