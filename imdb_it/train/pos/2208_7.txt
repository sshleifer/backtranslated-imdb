The university student Joanne Murray undertakes the unenviable job of preparing the student building to become apartments, which includes the sale of unnecessary furniture. It takes place during a break, so a mysterious psychopath is haunting the almost empty premises on campus. "Dripping Dormitory Blood" is a low-budget slasher movie that is pretty fun. The acting is pretty ugly, the plot is predictable, but the effects of the blood are quite good.
