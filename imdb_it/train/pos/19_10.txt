I have just read the comments from TomReynolds2004 and I feel I need to jump here. I understand that he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this film is that it is not afraid to walk the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and pain. Each of these two people, as a portrait, has many reasons for being embittered and angry, but finds tenderness and comfort in each other. Only a great acting could do this job without becoming an emotional, sentimental and mushy quagmire. I really got interested in these people because of their enormous humanity given them by such strong performances. I have every reason not to love Jane Fonda for her actions in the Vietnam era, but apart from personal feelings, she is fabulous in this role. Robert De Niro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begin to betray him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first time I've seen DeNiro use tenderness rather than strength to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a great surprise when I saw it for the first time and I can't wait to see it again.
