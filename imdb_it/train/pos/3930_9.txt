It is noteworthy that for the supporters of "Young Mr. Lincoln" Ford threw lesser-known, more famous actors. This not only increases the focus of his film on the central character of Lincoln, but also offers the public a refreshing vision of Lincoln as a man of his place and his time, a man involved, as each of us inexorably, in matters and feelings of his time and looking for his way to solve them. It is not so much through the words and actions of Fonda's Lincoln, but in the faces, the reactions of supportive players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln's vision, the sense of place in society and politics, and how the people answered Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds and put their trust in this man who they believed had earned their respect and listening. <br /> <br /> Try it: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, next time you will see "Young" Mr. Lincoln "turn your attention to the supporting characters - you will probably expect to be rewarded with a deeper appreciation of both Lincoln that of Ford I like to suspect that Ford's narrative through the reactions of the secondary characters at Fonda Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in "Doctor Zhivago", in which the reactions of the supporting characters are to Zhivago to actually tell about Zhivago.
