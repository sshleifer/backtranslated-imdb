The plot of this fun musical MGM is elaborate and only occasionally fun, deals with espionage and romance, but the focus of the film is correctly focused on the melodious interludes that show the talented and athletic dancer Eleanor Powell, flanked by Tommy Dorsey his orchestra, with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the maximum of accounts with Powell, and he and his partner Bert Lahr receive most of the comic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when, if he can be believed, he behaves like Powell's love interest with Virginia O'Brien who actually provides most of the film's humor as a dancer's companion. Powell's technical brilliance is highlighted during an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich contributes his percussionist skills, and which must be seen repeatedly to allow the breath to reach its precision. Director Edward Buzzell uses his large cast well to move the action pleasantly despite the rather bumpy script he has to deal with, and allows Powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the deal, as appropriate.
