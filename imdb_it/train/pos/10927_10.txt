This is one of my favorite kung-fu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers of the late 1970s. The plot is interesting and tortuous, the characters are fantastic each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard etc. The action is limited compared to other films by Chang Cheh / Venom but what's there is interesting with different styles of kung-fu on display by the various characters. I recommend this film to those who think that all of Shaw Brothers' films, especially those by Chang Cheh, are the same, most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and the conflicts between Shaolin and Manchu. This film is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
