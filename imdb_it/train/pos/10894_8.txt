I had some reservations about this film, I thought it would be the usual business card --- a Christmas formula film. Being in the middle of a heat wave towards the end of June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would have seen some snow. <br /> <br /> This film turned out to be a laugh after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the real protagonist of this is James Gandofini. He delivered his jokes with a real spirit on him and made a great "dad". <br /> <br /> If you want a nice couple of hours, definitely check this.
