The absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I highly recommend this movie. His interpretation, in my opinion, was an Oscar material! The only real sad fact here is that Universal didn't see that this movie had ever been available on any video format, be it tape or DVD. They are ignoring a VERY good movie. But Universal has little regard for his library on DVD, which is sad. If you have the chance to see it somewhere (I'm not sure why it rarely works over cable), watch it! I won't go into history because I think most people would prefer to have an opinion on the film, and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing about history, which is available everywhere. <br /> <br /> to 10!
