It's not a bad bad movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best we could be either with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or the Saint etc. In other words, you have the opportunity to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from simple to urban, murdering and killing - always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a worn-out lady to avenge and free her stuck and dead father, a police detective planning and carrying out a series of criminal murders with her brotherhood. Which would surely have had the opposite effect! Sanders joins the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting that falls both on him and on the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. <Br /> <br /> History and acting are OK, the only complaint I have is near the end with the hasty and almost laughable discovery of who was the genius of evil (Waldeman) - they have almost forgotten its relevance in the plot? That said, a solid entry in the series.
