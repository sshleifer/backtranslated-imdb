This film is perhaps the most touching and uplifting I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this film can give me an almost religious experience. Suddenly we understand that there is really a meaning for life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I heard about this movie I was skeptical. I thought the plot sounded forced and I feared that the story would be trivial. But being a fan of David Lynch I decided to try it. It took me about 30 minutes to be completely captured by the film, but then I completely lost myself. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left in the cinema the feeling of having really learned something precious about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch film, and in some ways it was really surprising that he should have made a film like that after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I'm not surprised that he is able to convey deep emotions and deep human intuitions because I also thought that he managed to manage it very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is best ever. 9.5 / 10
