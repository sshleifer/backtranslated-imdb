I went to watch this movie twice in a week and can only summarize in one word (which I normally don't use slightly): wonderful! In my opinion, the best film ever made. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards if not this Swedish crew that created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when all that is said (and left unsaid) throughout the story is drawn together? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus evokes so many feelings and long-suppressed feelings in the people around him, the film does the same with its viewers: you go out with your head in turmoil and your heart felt full. Big things! Next time you will ask yourself "what is the meaning of life", perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like As it in Heaven: Happy, content, fulfilled. To say it with Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway: "These moments are enough".
