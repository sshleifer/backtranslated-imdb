I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it got a good score of 7.3 stars, but only some of the reviews at the time of this writing were particularly positive. A strange situation and, hopefully, my positive review will direct people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky story of a smuggler and a thief who gets involved with the three sisters of an ancient dead planet and an evil force that wants to exploit the powers of the planets. This is an old movie and animation shows, but what is lacking in modern sophistication is offset by an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very oriented towards a western audience and very easy to look at. There are few, if any, references to specific and excellent Japanese culture for Anime novices to watch and have fun. Space Cobra itself is witty and funny. I can't say how much of this is due to the English dubbing or the intentions of the producer, but this is one of the few characters in the Japanese comedy that I find really funny. The style is very 1960s Barbarellish with a fantastic Yello soundtrack. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is constant action to advance the story. The strangest aspect of this film is how it starts as a comedy and ends with a very downbeat dramatic note. I can't think of another Anime movie or general that has been able to do it so transparently and convincingly. You barely realize what is happening, but it is done subtly and seems perfectly natural. Moreover, you really feel that the characters have gone on a journey and that lives have been changed by the whole experience. Check if you can.
