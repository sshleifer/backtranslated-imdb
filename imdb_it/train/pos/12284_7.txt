I could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt the need to exhibit a more disconcerting accent, pronounced with clenched teeth and from the bottom of the throat. Indeed, he rather ruined the film for me, and I turned away from what was probably a good performance from him (very irritating). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and, although I have always judged Jeremy Irons to be a good actor, I would not classify this film as one of his best. The film, however, has whetted my appetite, as well as some of the other comments made on this film, which I found very interesting, and I now intend to read the book.
