When I sat in the cinema I was in a good mood and didn't want to change it. But this film is a dramatic power. I was all sweaty and needed a shower later. So what do we have? Theoretically a training story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It occurred to me early on that the plot seemed to have been completely borrowed from "Fold It Like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl playing soccer and ruining her sister's wedding. Here we transferred him to a Turkish girl ruining his brother's marriage by doing Kung Fu. And we also have a love story and a competition. After accepting this, this turned out to be a moving and emotional drama and shows a beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert, though). Lead actress Semra Turan is not only the Danish female champion, but also offers an excellent performance, so it seems certain that we have some autobiographical impressions here taking into account that this is her first film and that she has no education as an actress. The rest of the support cast is fine, camera good, intense Kung Fu. Sidenotes: - The Turkish male audience has shown respect for doing something right. - The audience exploded in joy when our heroine finally reacted and attacked the boys who were severely beating her brother for revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese Kung Fu instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the lead role of the protagonist <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see him at the cinema do it, you will probably have an experience good and intense and I don't know if it works even on small screen
