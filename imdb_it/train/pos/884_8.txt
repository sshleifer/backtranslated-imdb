If you're a fan of film noir and you think you don't make it like before, here's your answer - don't make it in Hollywood anymore. We must turn to the French to remember how satisfactory, subtle and terrifying a well-made film of that kind can be. Read My Lips is a wonderfully unpleasant little gift for the faithful of director Jacques Audiard, with an acute narrative and beautiful interpretations of Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic plot may have been written in the 1940s: stupid but a captivating ex-prisoner and an intelligent but sloppy femme fatale (which turns out to be mercilessly ambitious) are discovered as they live lives of bleak despair desire, they manipulate each other to achieve their goals, develop a complex love / hate relationship, cook a criminal scheme that involves robbery, double crosses, close calls and lots of money. All actions take place in depressing, squalid and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Audiard has modeled some modern twists, of course. The femme fatale is an underdeveloped employee who seems to be almost deaf and uses her ability to read lips to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you might expect steaming love scenes, find that both characters are sexually uncomfortable and immature. Add some modern technology and music and it looks like a contemporary movie, but don't make mistakes - this is the old school noir. It's as good as any other movie of the genre and easily one of the best movies I've seen throughout the year.
