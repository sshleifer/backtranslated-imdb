My favorite horror movie. From the long first tracing to the final coup de theater, this is Carpenter's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 1963, little Michael Meyers kills his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from the Smith's Grove sanatorium. On Halloween night, Michael came home to kill again. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael chases and kills babysitters. No bell or whistle, just the basics. It is the almost terrifying atmosphere of Carpenter's terror that generates tension. Like any great horror film, the events are telegraphed very early, yet they still seem to happen by chance, never allowing the public the chance to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark lighting, the long constant -cam shots, and (above all) that damn disturbing music creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet seen in the film. There is a body count, but compared to the slash series after this it is quite small. That and most of the murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but in not knowing. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and good. PJ Soles supplies much of the limited humor film (and one of the best dead), Nancy Loomis turns into a decent performance and then there's the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. At first his performance seems timid and uncertain, yet he immediately realizes that it is perfect for the character, who is shy and reckless herself and is not at all prepared for what she has to face. And of course there's the perfect cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (maybe a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has a negative defect, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film many years ago almost countless clones, copies, cheats and imitators have arrived and have stolen (usually badly) the best pieces of the film until almost everything that has become familiar has become familiar. Combined with changes to public expectations and appetites, much of the film is diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be considered as it once was, as something unique. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have no reservations to recommend this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. The highest guards. <br /> <br /> 10/10
