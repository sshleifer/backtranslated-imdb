If I've ever been asked to remember a song from a movie from previous years, then it should be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the cinematographic photography when the sailboat turns off on the black background and on the shining stars. The other should be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last film before she died and the amount of time it took can be seen on the screen. In each of the songs that are photographed, he looks young but he doesn't. But an actor who did not change his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and in particular his feet, after accidentally approaching the cabin of the train and having seen them, leaves a note describing how beautiful they are . <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if possible, should be seen on the big screen only for the sake of photography and cinema songs. The film stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. Kamal Amrohi's nephew has now begun to revive his grandfather's studio by making a comedy film.
