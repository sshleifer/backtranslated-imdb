I just watched this movie on HBO, and it was really cool ... a tragic love story! I really appreciated the fact that the boy in the middle of the story lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story that involves someone who is physically disabled. The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life paints very well as I would like to think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... every 27 years old when she made this film ... she was fantastic as the woman so full of life that she is able to revive this boy's heart. Unfortunately, since his family is rich and his family is not, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> He is playing on HBO a few more times this month.
