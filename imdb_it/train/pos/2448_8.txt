Yes, it's over the top, yes it's a bit cliché and yes, Constance Marie is a total girl and worthy of seeing again and again! The jokes and the gags could get old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Since it is a family show, humor is toned down and writers have incorporated family values ​​and ideals into the gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is fun. Don't take it seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he didn't mean his character to be serious or an example of virtue. His explosions and shouts of joy are hilarious ... <br /> <br /> I must say that the only big, dark, bitter spot is Benny. I hate the character ... so much so that every time he is active for more than 30 seconds I mute the TV just to avoid having to hear it. There is nothing funny in his dialogue or in his lines. As a mother she must be the worst and I am just shocked and surprised that George, as a character, would remain at the head of someone so regrettable for so long. <br /> <br /> Even so every time I get to see Benny I think of myself: seeing it is much better than having to watch the Bill Engvall Show. Now there's a bad sitcom ...
