It's nice to see that Vintage Film Buff has correctly classified the excellent DVD as "musical", because this is what this film is, pure and simple. Like his unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super decorative girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also available to lend his strong voice to "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly the most popular song of the film, is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who steals the show, not only with her performance of "Sweet Marijauna", but with her strong interpretation as a girlfriend rejected by the hero. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen altogether. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how much the rest of the play is overly satisfied and overworked, Inspector McLaglen cannot simply get his hands on the killer even though, you would believe, in this case he appears to be the person you most suspect. Director Mitch Leisen actually strives to direct the killer towards the dumbest member of the cinema audience, giving the interested player the first floor after the first floor.
