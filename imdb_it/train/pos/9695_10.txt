Some people might call it a children's movie "Paulie," but I'd like to say it's more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film has made great efforts to show the difficult situation of immigrants in the United States - of great relevance given the recent debates. Portraying a parrot that tells a Russian immigrant janitor (Tony Shalhoub) how he looked for America for its original owners, the film tells several stories. There is the old woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom she makes friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very well done film. I don't usually expect much from these types of movies, but that's a pleasure. I would definitely recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
