The Sea Is Watching was made with an original Akira Kurosawa script, and it's really a lush and warm movie. Watching it will be a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai as a director is certainly not up to the old but timeless master (in particular the mass scenes at the beginning of the film have some terrible acting), but the general mood and the scenery is very funny. Another thing that escaped us here: Kurosawa has always managed to let the characters be much more than what they are showing and doing. <br /> <br /> That was probably his magic on the set during filming; and perhaps this script was still not completely on par. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we lack the master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is an adorable and sweet movie, but it's no Kurosawa. Expect it could be very silly ...
