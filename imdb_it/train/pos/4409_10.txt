This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave a vote of 10. The story is of the famous "Bushwhackers" of Missouri who fought from the South during the War between the United States. The clothes they wore were authentic, the story and the reason they fought was very accurate and well studied. There was actually one of the battles that didn't take place as they painted ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well made and were the brightest of actors or the director really knew how to get the best out of them. I suspect it was a combination of great direction, super casting to find the right people and excellent interpretations of the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie is really jealous! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and the story was shot in a single movie. He also has the future Spiderman and Gioiello. And she's good!
