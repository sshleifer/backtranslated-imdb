so yes, it is quite nostalgic to watch the 1st episode because this is the episode that I definitely remembered. I like watching the first season and yes compared to the action-packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly I like the "less violent" part of the show and the plot is more substance than the new ones now. It seemed interesting to me that Airis and JAG by Belisario have a similar theme: the main actor (Hawke and Harm) are both looking for a relative MIA (brother, father). I ask if the personal life of Robert Belisario imitates the theme of these two shows. <br /> <br /> Question: someone has photos of Hawke's cabin. I love that cabin (a bit like my dream cabin) and this is one of the scenes I remember of Airwolf.
