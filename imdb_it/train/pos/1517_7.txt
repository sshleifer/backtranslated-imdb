From the mind of Robert Bloch, of the fame of "Psycho", comes four stories of tormented terror in this anthology of Amicus, which, although not as much fun, or scary, as I would have liked, still offers decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is connected by the enveloping story of a highly skeptical Scottish detective (John Bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of a leading actor; he is advised that this case is connected to a few others from the house where they all took place and our film is off and running. <br /> <br /> "Method for Murder" has the author Charles Hillyer (always delightful Denholm Elliott) obsessed by his latest imaginary creation, which seems to have come to life. This sequence has beautiful surreal moments and enough suspense, and is crowned with a reasonably funny revelation and epilogue. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks" is the icon of horror Peter Cushing in the role of the retired broker Philip Grayson, who along with old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum. The sequence of dreams is more effective in this episode, even if it is as beautiful as always to look at Cushing. The final images presented to us in this story are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" features another beloved horror star, Christopher Lee, as John Reid, who does not treat adorable puppies Jane (Chloe Franks) too kindly, and it's up to new partner / tutor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) find out why. The mystery of this particular episode is excellently managed; directors wisely don't tip their hand so it's more than a genuine shock when we get the full truth of this unhappy family. The "dying" moments are particularly horrible. <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" has the absolute most comedy of the four; Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who played the role of Dr. Who over the years, is very funny as a venerable and temperamental horror film star (in fact, it's the highlight of this story) that, infuriated with the lack quality in his latest low-budget film, he goes out and buys his cloak. Said cloak has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here. The sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a companion of Pertwees; a wonderful example of humor here is a stroke of knowledge taken by none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The wrap-up story ends therefore in a predictable but effective way as Inspector Holloway learns that he should have taken all the warnings given to him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Underlined by Michael Dress's unusual, surprising and disturbing score, "The House That Dripped Blood" is a mix of funny stories; although I don't like it as much as, for example, "Tales from the Crypt", it's still a lot of fun. Directly directed by Peter Duffell, he moves slowly but surely towards each of his chilling conclusions, and is certainly a good film of this type. <br /> <br /> 7/10
