"Stairway to Heaven" is an exceptional invention of cinema, probably never duplicated. I classify it as "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although it is a totally different type of film than "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psychodrama that uses concepts of performance and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are absolutely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is the combination of B / W and color - as in "Oz", but the meaning of the contrast goes far beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect obtained in "Oz" . In "Scala" the purpose and effect of contrast can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another bright aspect of "Scala" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. Why did someone design a better way to make time stand still? literally? And then there's the Scala itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real gem.
