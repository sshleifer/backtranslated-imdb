This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely incredible. I saw it tonight on the Turner Classic movie channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy on DVD. The film does not seem all blurry and moved as you might think from the silent movie B & W of 1925. Set in Iran in 1925, the nomadic tribes of the documentary leave their home in the desert and cross a rushing river, men, women, children animals ... Then up and over a snowy mountain they all walk barefoot. It's sinking or swimming and climbing or dying. Looking for the grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene a man is carrying a mule that is too sick to climb the mountain. The children in the documentary all look happy and healthy. They have had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. It makes you appreciate modern life in the United States.
