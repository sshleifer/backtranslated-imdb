Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best musical adventure of Disney. I have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, intelligent and fun. Even despite the stupid scenes of the "flying bed", the other scenes and dialogues are magical and amusing. Could they have chosen someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can't think of anyone better suited to the role. Repeating this classic would be as stupid as the Mary Poppins remake. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he has had few quality film roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten today. Unprejudiced, primitive and correct English, no one could really do the slapstick and do it off gracefully like he does. It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been dead for some years and no one could descend into his shoes and do justice to his character. <br /> <br /> Nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other witch movies don't capture. I particularly like the parts where the Germans invade the house of Eglantine and you must defend it in any way possible. <br /> <br /> Stuttering, hopping at the bottom of the beautiful crystal clear sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers. All are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great film that still holds today !!
