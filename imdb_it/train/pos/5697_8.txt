May 2004, Wonderland is quite new in the UK. Brilliant film of a brutal true story. If you have known LA since the early 1980s, you will appreciate how well it was captured. The use of the elements that make up his gritty cinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to being there. The use of a disjointed "Pulp Fiction" timeline allows you to explore the uncertainty about what really happened, while the direction and performance of the cast draw attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I was distributing them.
