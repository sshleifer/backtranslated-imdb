It is easy to forget, once the subsequent series had developed the alien conspiracy arc more, than once, The X-Files' wrote episodes like "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry", where the aliens were not all small gray men or goop, but in reality it might surprise you. <br /> <br /> "Fearful Symmetry" starts with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant somehow displaced in space and time, not a mile away from "The Walk" "- and ends with a pregnant gorilla who is kidnapped. And it really is an episode of wonderful moments. The subplot is annoyingly worthy - yes, we understand it, zoos are bad except when they are not - but the ideas inside are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable, and they cover an abduction angle that is largely overlooked - why * humans are the only things aliens are interested in? <br /> <br /> In the end, it wasn't an instant classic, but it's it was a pleasant sight while it lasted, once again, very memorable, and mainly, it is something you can't imagine doing on other shows.
