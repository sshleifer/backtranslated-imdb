I thought this film was very well done, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was impeccable. Even Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were really good and credible. How true it is for what really happened, I have no idea, but it made people understand why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps those in authority have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first sight? In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain which was another good historical film. Overall I highly recommend this movie and I am a little baffled because it didn't work better in theaters.
