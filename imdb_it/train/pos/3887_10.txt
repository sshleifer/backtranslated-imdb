I managed to record it via satellite, but I would like to receive an original version in a format that we can use here in the United States. Eddie is really glorious in this San Francisco performance. I don't remember laughing so much during a stand up routine. Both my wife and I enjoyed this tape and its work on Glorious, I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more than his available shows.
