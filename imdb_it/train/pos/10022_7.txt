Aro Tolbukhin burned alive seven people on a mission to Guatemala in the 1970s. He also claimed to have murdered 16 others (he used to kill pregnant women, and then set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that portrays the personality of Aro through various interviews with people who got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, it's not pathetic at all. Such a horrible testimony about how a childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My vote: 7/10
