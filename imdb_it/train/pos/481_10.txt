This is one of the unusual cases in which a film and the novel on which it is based are both fantastic. Perhaps because Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a point of view on Luzhin that makes it more dignified than Nabokov's. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the film I don't like is Valentinov's influence on Luzhin's fate. I can't imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so much influence on the subject of the novel.
