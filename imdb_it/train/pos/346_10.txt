What a great movie! It was very scary, with great acting, well written, good twists, interesting characters, excellent direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a horror popcorn movie that may not be attractive to non-horror fans, but it's still (however) one of the best thrillers in circulation today! I highly recommend it to ONLY fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> O <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress featured in it. <br /> stars *** ****! <br /> <br /> PS - I'm sick of people who compare this, and other modern horror films, with SCREAM. You know what, they didn't want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!" Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM has also copied other films! In fact, almost all horror films have copied one of the previous ones. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But, still ... stop comparing it and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> AWAY AND RENT THIS ONE! <br /> <br />
