Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the kind of person that people would almost never know by name. However, he once again plays the coroner - one of the few actors in the films of Philo Vance who has played his role more than once. I've seen it twice before and loved it every time because it was so much fun and a breath of fresh air. This film is also fantastic to watch because, in addition to Girardot, there are many other wonderful protagonists of the trip - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a pretty impressive cast, and it certainly made the job easier for driving man and woman, Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great actors are one of the main reasons why I love these old B-movies. While the mystery itself is rarely so terrifying, thanks to ventilated writing and acting, the films truly satisfy. As for this film, Vance is wonderfully played by Lowe but, as I said, the mystery itself is just an afterthought - with a silly plot that involves hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't hypnotize anyone to do something like that - I trained in clinical hypnosis and if I could do something the wicked could do in the movie, I would have done it! Used car salesmen and some of my old bosses would have been obvious goals !! <br /> <br /> Overall, although not the best Philo Vance film, it was very nice and it's a shame that Lowe only played this role once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hampered by a long line of actors like Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) who played Vance. This is a similar problem that has also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series - just too many different actors playing the main character. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing and exciting, even if it is also impossible.
