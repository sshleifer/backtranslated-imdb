"A really beautiful story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this strange film by David Lynch. This was particularly "strange" because it was not the kind of film that Lynch had published in the last 15-20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know he disappointed many of his fans. Others were delighted. Contact me as one of the latter, and I also own all those "dark" films. <br /> <br /> This was another supposed life story, here describing in detail the journey of an old man in a lawnmower sitting from western Iowa to Wisconsin to see his sick brother he didn't have. spoken for years, but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess the premise - an old man driving a 400-mile lawn mower - still makes it a "weird" movie, so Lynch remains in the character! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the lead role. He is the kind of guy, wise, wise, wise of personality, that everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many stories. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this film are not many, and not always pleasant as it shows the main child and mental problems of the character (Sissy Spacek) and his tragic past, but once that Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey, history resumes. I played this for many friends and they thought that the film had NEVER picked up, but I'm more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. For them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found your journey rather fascinating but you must understand in advance that this will not be a suspenseful crime story. It's slow and if it's good for you, you might like it. Fascination enters the scene in some of the people that Alvin meets along the way, like a rebellious little girl who runs away and some nice citizens who help the old man go out when he gets into trouble. (Henry Cada in the role of "Daniel Riordan, is a champion in that sense.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third billing, but it's a joke: it's only in the last minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> The scenario of 'Iowa is nice, I lived there for several years and I can attest to the rolling hills and fertile soil, it's a beautiful state with nice people ... like this movie.
