Return to page 10 of this review section and return to your work. Go ahead; I'll wait. <br /> <br /> Done? Well, then you probably have noticed the same trend I have. You could tease all day about the limping jokes, dated timing and of course the derivative plot points and shtick in 'Bogus', but this movie seems to be one of those who "hate me now, love me later". <br /> <The main problem with Bill and Ted was that the original appealed to those 80s kids who followed trends and considered themselves to be at the cutting edge of fashion, which worked great for the original, but obviously bombed in 1991, when no idler who did not care for himself would be caught dead wearing anything but the flannel or admitted that he liked something from the 80s. As Ted would have said: "Friend, this is a totally deep hole. Do you want to ask 20 questions ? "<br /> <br /> They say that nostalgia goes in cycles of 20 years, and it really seems to be so, here in 2010, those who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth are starting to look back to appreciate some of those fundamental films that (like it or not) have made us what we are. If you are one of those who look at 'Bogus' as if it were a superfluous ("Fa gs!"), Then you miss the point and probably six years spent growing facial hair, wearing flannel and looking just barely out of bed . <br /> <br /> In reporting its origins (the Star Trek episode) and the time it travels with a phone booth, B & T makes no attempt to hide the love of its creators for the tribute. Quentin Tarantino, someone? I'm not saying "Bogus" is "True Love", but I think it should be appreciated for what it is: an instant fun of our society at a time before child psychology, Ritalin, anti-smoking advertisements, terrorist paranoia and proliferation of media terrorists. <br /> <br /> So, for all of you, B & T hates out ... turn off the Screaming Trees CD, take your hair off your face, go to the beach and lighten up. Narcissistic depression and intellectual boredom are SO corporate.
