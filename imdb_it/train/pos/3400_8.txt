Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of his life taking care of his father. Now that he's dead he's free, but he doesn't know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who fled a monastery to taste more life. They accidentally meet in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But he can't leave his past behind and she can't live without him ... <br /> <br /> WAY is an exaggerated novel full of smelly dialogues and situations. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to perform well but NO ONE could get away with some of their lines! However, in a sense, it is a classic. It is shot in splendid Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where every frame is incredibly beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed for the '9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes hysterical poses to show his clothes and his body. Boyer walks around with the affected air (no shock). I never got bored yet. It was wonderful to watch and the stupid non-stop dialogue kept me at bay. The end almost knocked me out of my chair because I was laughing so hard! Now I love romance novels and give them a lot of space but really --- this is incredible! It also works for a short period of 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a classic of the field, I give him an 8. As a serious film - a 1.
