This film documents the Harlem circuit in the mid-1980s. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, although equally sick, this film is a real gem of squalor. You can't help but sympathize with the characters because of their strangeness. The sole purpose of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of garbage and pageantry. Here the most brilliant of garbage is extremely well documented and duly fascinated. The inclination of the characters to the idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on a part of the spectator, creating an effect "phenomenon of a phenomenon" that makes this film a work of art.
