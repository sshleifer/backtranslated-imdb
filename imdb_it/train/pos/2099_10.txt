This is superb - wonderful acting, sets, clothes, music - but above all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I am amazed that there are no more reviews of this film - certainly one of the best 80s. <br /> <br /> It is also a wonderful film to see in tandem with the great "Random Harvest" which has the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - an unknown English WWI middle-aged official is in a hospital towards the end of the war, suffers from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of ​​his name, origin or wherever he belongs - proves to be a very rich man - when he "recovers", he will not remember the years before of the war - <br /> <br /> But the resemblances of the films end. <br /> <br /> My warmest thanks to all those who participated in the film - in particular the actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a great and surprising casting choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This stays with you forever.
