Every day we can watch a large number of films, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director-realist. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see: is the first Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we need to know humility, love for others, acceptance of other civilizations, other ways of living. We must also fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; we just have to love our earth companion. This wonderful film helps us achieve John's (Lennon) dream: imagine all the people who live living in peace. These two films are hard to see: look at them, but surely you will be hurt, but better. Great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also a better understanding of others. Have fun.
