this is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time when it came out. Recently I saw this movie again and it still keeps it in my memory. Many films we have seen as young people do not seem to hold up when we observe them later in life. The film is actually a great example of the 80s of the kind of films made then. Keaton is at his best, all the actors actually did a great job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the film rather than forcing it. The pace of the film is fast with a few slow points and seeing the cars of the 80s is too much fun. Being from the 80s I loved seeing the ugly pacer again. The film is a great film for all lovers of comedy and lovers of the 80s.
