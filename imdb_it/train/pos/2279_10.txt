Prior to this, the "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this film adaptation of "Mother Night" is very faithful to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery and tragedy intact. Fortunately he was not a Hollywood or idiot at the "Breakfast of Champions" cinema. Another good thing about this film is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). It's probably true even for Breakfast of Champions, but they did a job so bad that you feel good just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film.
