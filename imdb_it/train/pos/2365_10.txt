Jeff Wincott is not just a Hunk, he can kick! This film has some of the best martial arts moves I've seen in a long time. Ok, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would hire to play a ruthless politician, he still did a GREAT job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this film starring Karen Sheperd, a martial arts expert and stuntman. So you're not Cynthia Rothrock, Who CARES?! It is just as good, if not better! (looks at his fight scene at the end of the film, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out on some great martial arts action.
