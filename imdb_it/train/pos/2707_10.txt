Cor blimey. This film really surprised me as it is a masterpiece of comedy. Billy Zane is amazing as a central character, and everyone can play it straight enough for comedy to be natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the sets are a joy to admire. I suggest you watch this movie with a group of friends, some bottles of your favorite liqueur and get ready to be astonished and amused. <br /> <br /> Continues so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space is in the true cinematographic tradition "B". But what makes it more is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find myself giggling at the scene where Zane steps up a series of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a little crazy, and so much the better for this.
