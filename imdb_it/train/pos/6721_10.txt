If it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport - no, the pure lifestyle - of surfing to its perfect form, this documentary did it. This documentary shows that life is not just about the waves, but about the people, the pioneers and the modern avant-garde who are pushing the envelope of the big wave beyond what it has ever been. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend of my early 80s skateboarding teen years at SoCal - has assembled reams of incredible series sequences and interviews to their very core and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and clearly it is here - his genius is bristling with a pure vision that does not fascinate, exalt or sentiment his subject. Revere the surfers and the surf / beach lifestyle, but don't fade it either. There is also a gritty reality for sport. <br /> <br /> There is so much you can say about this documentary, surfers, the ancient history of the sport, and the wild surfers of big waves that loom. Greg Noll, the first big wave personality who probably pioneered sport; Jeff Carter, an incredible guy who practically rode alone for 15 years in the extreme surf of Maverick, extremely dangerous for northern California; and, the highlight of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, the current messiah of the great surf wave. <br /> <br /> There is a tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys - and some girls who come to the camera - and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that goes through every word. I found the story of how Hamilton's adoptive father met him and how Hamilton, a small child of 4 or 5, practically forced him to become his particularly moving father (and, again, deprived of syrupy sentimentality). <br /> <br /> If you like surfing - or even if you don't - this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched, if only because you are a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well made works of art.
