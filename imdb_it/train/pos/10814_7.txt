Given the opposite circumstance of 2009 in which the reality is that we have a black president, this film takes on a rather powerful historical significance. For the value of entertainment I found this film challenging and repulsive. I was naturally taken up by the obvious racism of the time, but I also found the music and the incredible dances. Also, it's nice enough to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a boy who is comforted by his Mammy. He is told 'Because one day you could be president'. It was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be captivating, charming and fun. Most of the film is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it were run by a black man. They describe the headquarters of the government as a revivalist Baptist church. The fact is that when I stumbled upon this film one day it attracted me. It's really well done and a lot of fun. I believe that if we can look beyond racism we can see this film for all that it brings us. In fact, realizing that it's not just ridiculous to have a black president, but that's normal, makes this film much more relevant. It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
