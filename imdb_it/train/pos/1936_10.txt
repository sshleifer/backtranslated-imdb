this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival I've ever seen there, I loved it there are so many things that was great for the film on top of everything the cast and crew I have had the opportunity to meet they were absolutely phenomenal. I thought that Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true to his role as a Disney actor. I was amazed by his talent of being able to move from a teenage comedy to a problem-free adult role, the talent in the film was simply fantastic, photography was simply fantastic you want to see an independent film this is what you should see. I think Mr. Gruver would have been so proud to have such submission in his festival and his parents loved the film so much when he won the favorite audience. and I saw it again. this was really a fantastic movie, it was dark and funny, sad and really exciting it was just fabulous. I am genuinely so enthusiastic about this film and I really don't want to ruin it because no one sees it and it really amazes me that I really think these directors really have what it takes to go to places and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
