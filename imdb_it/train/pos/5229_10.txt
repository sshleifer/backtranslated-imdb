This film has received horrible ratings from almost everyone who voted here, but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If you are interested in films like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id you have to take a different angle. Yet I still love this film and all this even if it is a bit "kiddy" this is one of the few films that my friends and I have been able to continue to watch over the years and quote whenever possible. GREAT FILM. This film should be AFI's number 1 because its class is so fussy. The only problem with this film is that you may have trouble seeing it because it was created for a TV movie on a channel that no longer exists. So I don't know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for DVD but I can't find it anywhere. I've recorded it since it was the first, you can come if you want and watch it before I'm sleeping. this movie sucks and this is basically all you need to know.
