In what is a really different cast, this show hits his stride in FOX. It's the kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you only watch 1 show you may not like it very much, but once you watch two or three, you hook it up. <br /> <br /> This is because some jokes are striking and others are missing depending on how you see them. As is usual today, the themes are very mature. Humor is also usually very mature. Often the funniest parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith), a veteran actor, makes a great unabashed humor in this show. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this ensemble cast. Danny Masterson, the oldest "boy" actor, is also very good. Laura Prepon (Woman) looks better in previous shows like a natural redhead (who got the idea to make her a blonde?). It often shows very good talent and comic timing. It is beautiful even without make-up. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best voices on FOX in the sitcom department and its most successful live action is that of Married With Children
