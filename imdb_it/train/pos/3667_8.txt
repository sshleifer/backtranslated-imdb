Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time of the history of Canadian cinema when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Most often it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to make American films. For example, Porky's came out of it. In any case, Matthew Modine interprets a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel. However, to get the money he needs a star of the American name. He gets a loose cannon and learns that he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book he was originally based on. Sounds good in Canada, but may not be understood outside of the Great White North. Americans will think we are satirizing ourselves, but they will lose the fact that we are actually satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
