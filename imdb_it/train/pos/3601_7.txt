Michelle Rodriguez is the actress who could be the recharging force for other actresses to watch out for. She has the audacity to enter a tough girl role rarely seen very early in her career (and make it), which is a business that should be recognized. Although his later films have recorded it in the same role, this film was created for its robustness. <br /> <br /> His character is a student / fighter / romantic lover, who struggles to overcome his disenchanted existence in projects, which is a bit exaggerated in the film ... but not by a girl. That aspect of this film is not very original, but the story deepens when the heated relationships with which this girl has to confront come to a boil and her primary anger takes over. <br /> <br /> I have haven 'I've seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in creating movies, and I'm glad she's getting that original twist out there in Hollywood. This film gave me a 7 because of the average history of young people in the ghetto, but has such a great actress who plays a role rarely seen in a minimal economic film. Good job.
