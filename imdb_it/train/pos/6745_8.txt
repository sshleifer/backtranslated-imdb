A sequence of Turkish baths in a film noir set in New York in the 1950s, which must be a hint of something! Something that curiously, in all the previous comments, nobody pointed out, but it seems essential to me to understand this film <br /> <br /> the sequence of Turkish baths: a secondary road at night, the entrance to a sauna squalid and Scalise wrapped in a sheet, massaged her thighs. Steve, the massage therapist is the kind of young crude boxer (Beefcake!), And another guy, a bodyguard? finish dressing. Dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets hard right away. We know he has a reputation for mistreating suspects. Good cop but escaped control. Why is it that he hates them so much? <br /> <br /> It could be that he hates himself. Did this part of him inherit from his father? That dark side that could take him right to the end of the sidewalk, into the eaves? And if that dark side was hiding in a "closet"? Remember: every time Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the boy is lying on a bed and has only men around him for company (the irony of the "Girls" poster hanging on the wall near his bed!). /> <br /> Scalise behaves in a fun way: affectionate ways, craning his neck with arrogance, rebel, pushing his inhaler (poppers?) into his nostrils every time he talks to Dixon. Dixon, with some vengeance, is determined to fix Scalise who does not seem to understand: "I have never seen a man so full of hatred as you. I consider it almost fun the way you came after me." Four years jumping on me like I'm someone special! Why? "<br /> <br /> Because Scalise is really a special person: he is the direct heir of Dixon's father:" I liked your father "," Your father put me in business. "He is Dixon's criminal brother , his dark side became incarnate and, above all, he prefers the company of men, Dixon knows it well: "Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? "Comrades! Notice how every time they meet, Dixon handles Scalise: takes his address from his jacket, slaps his face, punches him .. Scalise:" I warn you not to touch me! Dixon's homophobia is obvious, or it is different: his unexpressed homosexuality Dixon, aka Dixon's son, is the son of a thief. In response to this, he decided to become a policeman, a good one, but there is something about the criminal in him, a dark side: he is a violent copper, a murderer, a liar, moreover, he is not married, he carries "a dizzy blonde "to her familiar place to eat once in a while, but nothing else. The deriding maid says she doesn't know how to make love with a woman, Dixon has a deep sense of guilt and hates herself for these reasons. "A hood and a mafioso like his old man. Blood will tell." Finally, to obtain redemption, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him, he will get rid of the guilt and free the girl and also her father. <br /> <br /> The end of the film takes us back to the opening sequence: Scalise is pushed into the sewer and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the pavement and wins the lady's love. It's finally straight. <br /> <br /> The untold theme of the film could very well be that of a man who, to cover up his repressed feelings, wants to feel the love of a woman (Jean Douchet) <br /> <br /> (These notes owe much to the commentary of Jean Douchet's film on the French DVD edited by CarlottaI
