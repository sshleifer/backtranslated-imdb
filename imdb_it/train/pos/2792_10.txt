I love this movie. It's a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist problems, like girls who want to play sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of an Indian person who wants to break his cultural barriers and women who want to break the gender restrictions in sport, especially in England at the time. I feel that cultural struggles are more emphasized than other issues. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the other comment, I don't think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other movie like that. This move is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.
