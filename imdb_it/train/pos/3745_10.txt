Many mysterious stories follow the standard path of the whodunits: the most disgusting murder, the collection of clues, the bunch of possible perp, the sprinkling of false herrings and the inevitable showdown between the cunning clever and a still crime solver smarter. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten" abandons the trot and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible deeds. The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no well-ordered package could frustrate some, but for me it was an indication of a cleverly elaborated story that probes, disturbs and pursues the question: what does a person look like? evil? <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten.
