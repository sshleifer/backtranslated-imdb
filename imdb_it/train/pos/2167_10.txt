I saw this movie in 1984, we started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to watch this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory around you, you would like to see this. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself when you watch this film is: do you think the government would be able to do this? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could do it) <br /> <br /> But I don't want to give too much information as it would be a spoiler and I think you should see the movie alone. <br /> <br /> But just to let you know, we're still talking about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people isn't the easiest thing to do in the world.
