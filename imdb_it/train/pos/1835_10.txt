What an exceptional film this is, I have no words to describe it. I don't know why the evaluation of the film is 7.3 should be 9.3 but in any case no one else can do this film and the acting of Akshay is simply exceptional the second half of the film makes you cry and the film has really good unexpected ending that makes the perfect movie. you should watch this movie once, I think twice that it's up to you. Anyway, I love this movie and it's not only sad and fun, but it also gives you good meaning and what you should do, so I think this is one of the best films in Bollywood history. but I know that people have deferentially chooses so. the only thing I don't like about this movie is the music and the background music is good but the songs are not good enough I think the music would be better if AR Rahman was the music director, but we can't do anything about it anyway purpose
