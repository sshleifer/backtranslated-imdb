TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> by Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years the public has seen and understood war films with each possible point of view, and somehow producers and writers always devise new and innovative methods to portray various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), easily one of the riskiest directors currently working, found a resemblance to "The Thin Red Line" in the way his new drama "Tigerland" enters a single soldier. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan". Although the dramatic impact of the film has diminished somewhat due to the perversity of the present material, it certainly illuminates us with a new perspective on training young men for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to learn about Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really so bold and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees its intransigent world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is a rebel against the ideas of war. His personality instantly contrasts with many other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose flamboyant temper often exacerbates Bozz's tension with the idea of ​​going in war. The war represented in this production is not on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a Louisiana-based training camp between conceptions and fears of soldiers in training. This film is specifically about preparing for war, nothing more, nothing less. It ends when the soldiers eventually go to war, a bit disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb prize. <br /> <br /> Shot on location in about 28 days with a stock of 16 mm and a minimum budget, Joel Schumacher accurately shows a gritty, perverse, cruel and ruthless atmosphere using manual cinematography, lighting techniques unique and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blown images make the film look like a documentary film. This unusual style of cinema contributes only to the hard realism of the film, rather graphic in the use of vulgar language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words hit the audience, some from the shock of what they are hearing. Even the extreme amount of vulgarity does not prevent dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, "Tigerland" gives us a minimum appreciation of how much our soldiers cross for our country in the early stages of the fight. Such courage must take to enlist in the army during times of war, knowing the difficulties and risks that are taken. These stimulating ideas are made possible by the harrowing performances of the aspiring young actors who portray the various students. This film is not for all audiences, but one that young people should take a look at before joining the army ... and the adult public should look to appreciate the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
