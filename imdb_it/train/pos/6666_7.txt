I cannot say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol accumulated on it by some reviewers. Yes, it's bogged down by an overly stuffed run time, altered editing and an excessive reliance on the special effects of cheeseball. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to convince the average audience to sit down without checking its watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some funny laughs, a talented and serious cast, and the classic premise of a loser. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the "core" team, and Garofalo and Studi do an excellent job adding conflict and variety to the team. I can't say that Reubens or Mitchell have added much to the film in general, even though everyone has had some chances to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic "underdog-fa-good" stuff. No surprise there, since you know they are about to triumph. What makes it useful is not the absurd, the glaring heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Underneath all this, these people are children in the heart, who just want to do well. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional basis. Look at Azaria's relationship with her long-suffering mother; Macy's tender innocence in her reluctance to accept Cap. The secret identity of Amazing; Stiller's anger (not unlike that of a strange and swept boy who once knew he would always meet tremendous and impotent angers in the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge his father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the real charm of superhero comics; and under his external parody, "Mystery Men" shows us why these comic-book tropics are important to many. <br /> <br /> He is never really jealous in a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of semi-cooked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot it's so much fun that it makes up for it. The fact that it's supposed to be pretty meaningless fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here, so I'll give a warning: if you're the kind of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplainable and illogical ("I have to believe it's a kind of ... * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone?"), so you're too literal and lacking in sense of humor for this movie. Go instead to rent a Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
