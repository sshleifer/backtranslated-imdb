Hi, I come from Taft California and I like this movie because it shows how we people in the small city love our sport football is the main thing in Taft and this film shows how important it is personally I think they should make another but instead of the actors we use children to play games and show you our determination we have beaten Bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since i'm a senior next year it's my last chance and then the college we had been and i'm the next if you want to know me I'm kyle Taylor and I have an average of seven or eight yards a carry and about five times a bad game is interrupted on a 75 or around that yard you run so check-out on our site and go to our sport page bye
