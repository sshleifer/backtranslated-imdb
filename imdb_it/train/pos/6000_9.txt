Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is in pieces, her lover is missing; he cannot overcome his love for him that is lost in the past. He hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives him a list of his mistakes with the things to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point that impresses in "The Cure" is the elegant cinematography that alternates white and black with color. The concise and clear script is able to develop a tragic and distressing love story with an unexpected plot point just at the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a bit noisy and associated with the fact that English is not my mother tongue, at times I needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator. The unknown lead actress has magnificent performances and is extremely opulent. I hope to have the chance to see it again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
