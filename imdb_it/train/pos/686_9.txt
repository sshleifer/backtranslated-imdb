Ghost Story (the TV movie - 1972) was the NBC series pilot. The film was well written and well acted and, I thought, when the 1972-73 television season began, if the television series was halved compared to the film, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video !!) The series was a colossal disappointment - even with William Castle as an exec. producer. If, however, you have the chance to watch the original TV movie, Ghost Story, take a look. You will not be disappointed.
