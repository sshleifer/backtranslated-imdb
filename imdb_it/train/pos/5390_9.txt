Life Begins is a wonderful pre-coded film with some of the best of the era. It is set in the maternity ward of a hospital, particularly in the room for women who expect to have problems. There is an old woman, an unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a fragile young woman, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young) who spends 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second in pain to know that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is very good at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and fun. It's not terribly shocking in any way, but it's interesting to see such a neglected topic on the big screen. The acting is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is beautiful here in her flower. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is as sincere as can be. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is very good as always, a cornerstone of pre-codes and for good reason.
