It's a fantastic movie if you've ever called your cars or you're really fond of old, fast or exotic cars. It has a plot and a lot of action. The car scenes are fantastic except for the totally fake car jump scene. All the other scenes are fantastic. I liked it a lot and I hope everyone else does too.
