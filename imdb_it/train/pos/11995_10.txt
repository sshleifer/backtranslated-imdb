"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The 90s opened with a brilliant Disney character, "TaleSpin", the cartoon series for TV with characters from "The Jungle Book". Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly over the Sea Duck like you've never seen before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie's, up the mountains, in the jungle, on the water, in volcanoes, in search of adventure, in search of treasures, looking for fun, all in an action-packed cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was my favorite and that of my family. The film ran on The Disney Afternoon throughout the first half of the 1990s, until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before taking the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: DVDs are here today !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
