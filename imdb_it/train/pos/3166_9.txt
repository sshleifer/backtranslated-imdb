This show has come so far. At first ALL in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, new faces, and they only watched what they did. They blocked the show and it was a success. It's one of the best shows ever made and it's probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it finish, but if they finish this show, I hope the series finale goes off with one of the greatest shots that any season finale has ever had. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Get down, give yourself one last shot. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, they leave, let everyone know that it will end, like on Friends, and that the ending is huge. I say marry Donna and Eric, I say that Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say that something interesting happens between Fez and Jackie because Fez tried for so long, but obviously it won't work for him. CLOSE CLOSE THE GREAT SERIES OF THE SERIES! <br /> <br /> That 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
