Smart, ironic and electrifying, "The Invisible Man" stood out in 2000 in the usual Sci-Fi lineup, balancing the fantastic artistic direction of "Farscape" and, at times, the melodramatic script with gritty and cynical plots and modern noir dialogues. The show was between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility meter, but there was no denying the fact that the characters of "I-Man" went beyond caricature. Even the characters that bordered on predictability, such as the Keeper, the Officer and the Eberts, received relief from the formulas. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science has only sometimes turned to the incredible. The low points of the show are still fun, and I've never seen such tough pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised, and fans have the right to request a complete DVD version of the show. Every time I run into a "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" marathon on Sci-Fi, I look up and sigh, crying out the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that "Invisible Man" and his genre represented.
