This series, probably produced at the most propitious moment after the events of the Second World War, is on a scale of values ​​that goes well above the presumption of criticism of each individual. <br /> <br /> The timing of the production of World at War in 1974, which amounted to about three decades after the war, allows an accurate connection of events in a non-colored way from residual propaganda and inclination. The passage of thirty years allows the story to be supported by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the same individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures to the soldiers, civilians and camp death camp survivors as they remained in to witness the unimaginable inhumanity that civilized human beings are capable of. Most of the people interviewed approached or had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most cases they had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor they might have influenced them in the past for leaving, leaving only memories of what they saw and what they did. <br /> <br /> The information that these survivors give, greatly enhanced by the postures and expressions they show as they share their part, gives their stories an even greater impact. Names like Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is too long to be told. <br /> <br /> Today, during the life of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the horrible price of political ambition, there are young people who sing the same type of militarist and nationalist war promotion that led to the Second World War . The series of DVDs we are discussing here should include the core of a compulsory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who have not seen of terrible price person. <br /> <br /> I almost finished watching the 11-disc set, having seen most of the series when a local TV channel broadcast it over 10 years ago. It has lost none of its intensity for me, indeed it has become even more a magnificent chronicle of some of the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest possible score seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. I think the value of this series is beyond counting.
