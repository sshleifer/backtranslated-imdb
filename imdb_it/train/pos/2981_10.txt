Why the shit is such a low film ?! I've seen this movie more than 25 times, I know every line of this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) play the main characters Joe Cooper, Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish". Mostly they refer to Coop and Remer for the whole film. Right at the beginning of the film, it reminds us of the corrupt, money-hungry world of overpaid sports, even going so far as to make one called "Townsell". I have to mention this part of the film because it is true with some sports it starts: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Houston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus a season as a major at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent leans over:" Minnesota ". Let's not forget this important piece of the film. It starts so that Coop and Remer attend a high school meeting and understand that they are still nothing while they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the BASEketball sport after being challenged by what were probably the heroes of high school basketball. After having softened them, the sport becomes a professional in about a year. During this time they succeed in recruiting their third companion Squeak, which is actually a day after inventing the game. While the film follows, we discover that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only remaining virtuous sporting heroes. The plot follows with absurd blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders and the absurd humor that will leave you crying for something else. Look at him friend, it's fun.
