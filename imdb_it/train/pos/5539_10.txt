When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a registered copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still have the tape and I confess I saw it more than once from start to finish! The film has an extremely low budget and dialogue is often unintentionally funny! I got some of my friends to see it and we had some good laughs from the terrible script. The film is about a couple, (remember, it's like in the early 1970s, so I'm just too trendy!) They go to a weekend camp in what I think should be in the north of New York. They have a hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl complains about the death of the fish and they ate it! The boy returns with something stupid about how they ate the fish and now it was part of them, and he leaves; "And this is a handsome man!" Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! However, two veterinarians from Vietnam came, one of whom plays the flute, I think. (However, they are musicians!) The boys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple turns out to be hostile, they end up frightening them during the night. The guy ends up in a cage in a chicken coop and has to see his girlfriend be raped by the two boys. Actually, by the end of the evening, she seems to be quite involved, and when the morning comes, the boys leave and the girl and the boy are free to leave. Presumably the boy learned a lesson on how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh! Never fails to have fun anyway! If I could find it on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I'd buy it again, it's a classic field! You have to love this stuff!
