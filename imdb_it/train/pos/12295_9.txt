"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné film of the period 1936-1946 which has dialogues not written by Jacques Prévert, but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was much more interested in the couple Jouvet / Arletty than in the couple in love, Annabella / Aumont. This is rather bland, and their story is strangely reminiscent of Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour", except the fable of Chanteuse is tragic. What is fascinating today is this small popular world, the Saint-Martin channel settings. <br /> <br /> This film is dear to fans of French cinema for another very special reason. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégé Raymonde that he wants a change of air (atmosphere) Because she doesn't understand the meaning of the atmosphere of the world, the whore Raymonde (the wonderful Arletty) thinks it's an insult and she offers this line, that is, undeniably, the most famous of all French cinema: <br /> <br /> In French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Translation attempt: "Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Do I have a face like this? This is our French "Nobody's perfect".
