Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Don't expect the production values ​​of a film version, but expect the highest quality of direct to video release. <br /> <br /> It is set as Timon & Pumba begin to look at the original Lion King in a darkened theater and suddenly changes tracks and begins to tell his own story. This is done with frequent comic interruptions. For example, during a particular moment of tension, a home shopping spot opens and an uncomfortable Pumba realizes that it has sat on the remote control. These little moments season the movie and whether you find them funny or not will depend a lot on your sense of humor. If you are particularly disturbed by films that deliberately remind you that the viewer is watching a movie, then this may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best they have invested in the Disney DTV line, and is integrated almost perfectly with the original material. The new independent material makes great use of the artistic style of the original. The vocal talents are all well executed, although I couldn't help but think of Marge Simpson whenever I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film will be well recognized by the spectators as being recycled over generations, but they are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable strangenesses of old friends than annoyingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> Music made me realize how much I liked it and I miss a good musical integrated with a Disney movie. Dig A Tunnel's finger-opening function is well choreographed and fun. Even Timon and Pumba interpret the opening sequence of the Lion King and their introduction to paradise are fun. The only problem was the resumption of the "Dig A Tunnel" at the end of the film, changing its lyrics and tuning from defeatists to edifying. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite well done and the integration of new graphic elements is done almost perfectly, even if the last piece during the hyena was a bit chasing the credibility of the plot. The new story does not seem to handle messy or emotionally charged moments well, and it does better when resorting to full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth buying. If you like all the bonus features provided with a typical 2 disc set, then do it. For the penny pincher who is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until he drops four or more dollars and go get it right away. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
