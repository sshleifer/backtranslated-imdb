"A Thief in the Night" is a film that was generally ignored by fans of cinema in general because of its small budget (which was obvious) and its subject - the Rapture of the true Christian church and the fate of those left behind . However, it was a compelling story that kept the viewer and surely made him or her review their relationship with Jesus Christ. He touched everyone - even showing a pastor who preached the Word, but didn't believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This film, and its sequel "Distant Thunder", must see the films. Even with the new "Left Behind" series coming out, telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is always the same - "A Thief in the Night" paved the way for this genre and will always be remembered.
