This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc has no special features, not even a menu, but it's not necessarily what interests me. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge films on a case-by-case basis, depending, among other things, on whether it's a large studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I think it has one of the most imaginative and original sequences of titles I've seen. <br /> <br /> I liked the acting of all the main actors. I particularly appreciated Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character played by Claire Forlani may seem unrealistic to some people, but I personally have met real people with emotional problems who look at life's decisions as easily as her character does. This helped me to pick up the nuances in which his wounds could come out through the lining of his humor. <br /> <br /> This is not a children's film, of course, but it does NOT engage in free sex and nudity. There is a lot of language for adults, but sometimes it can be a lot of fun. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, who cannot even swear correctly.) <br /> <br /> See also the cameos of famous people.
