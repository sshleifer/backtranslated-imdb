Perhaps "Presque Rien" is not the best film ever made ... But it is better than many of you have said. I haven't seen a homosexual movie better than this yet. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative films, with a clear beginning, development and results. But European films are less narrative, but they make you think a lot and feel. <br /> <br /> Many of you have not understood the meaning of the film .. The purpose of this is not to show us a simple "summer" movie of love, "with commercial characters who" fall in love and live happily forever ". The summer holidays and the beach are just a background and this film is aimed at all the kids who might feel identified with those kids. <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you didn't quite understand this movie because of of its 3 parts, shown as flashback. These 3 moments are: - Summertime in Pornichet, when they meet and love each other. - After a year and a half of living together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go alone to psychiatry. "Something, and Cedric takes him to the hospital. Later, he seems to talk to a psychiatrist to find out why he did it." The last part is when Mathieu returns to Pornichet, in winter, alone, to think. how his life has changed, how his life becomes, and trying to find again if he is ssa. <br /> <br /> Some people may not be able to understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed together. But anyway, like I said before ... this is not a funny movie. If what someone wants to see is flesh, then we have Belami films. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what wants to show us, is how cruel life can be, for a guy who is not sure about his feelings and I'm not sure what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to get away from home, and try to live the kind of life he thought would bring him happiness .. But what seemed perfect at the beginning .. later is not as good as he thought, and becomes upset, and I feel he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. In the end he gets depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, fun? Not a funny movie Very hot scenes? just some .. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Everything revolves around feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with Mathieu's life and problems, and this is what the director wanted to do .. a film that shows us the cruel reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best homo-themed film ever.
