Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror film. I would like North American horror producers to take a page from the Japanese horror model and put more spookiness and less economic shocks on their gestures. A lot of good examples in this, scenes in which a bleached face is the scene that stares behind a young actress, the photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling, just for a second, and more. It's worth checking out if you like the genre.
