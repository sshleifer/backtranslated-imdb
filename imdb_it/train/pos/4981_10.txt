I personally think this film is a rare treasure. Not only is it the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You have to understand, certain things that today we would consider sexual, then they would be considered innocent. For example, the parents of the children in the film, as well as the many parents who brought their children to see this film, saw this as simple children imitating adults. Most people didn't think anyone saw sexually attractive children, except for teenagers who wanted teenage girls. For them it was not sexual. Mind you before we had internet, TV, etc. Most sexual crimes have not been openly raised. Occasionally there would be a whisper on the boy with the "funny uncle". But often it was all that came with it. Yes, very sad. But today it is a bit sad, because I too can see this film as something different from what it was meant for, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dance that way and the boys' eye hit her, yes, I felt disturbed. I have to remind myself that now it has happened! Those kids didn't know what sex was. The parents knew it, both those of the children in the film and those who looked at it. Perhaps the thought has not even entered their mind. In the eyes of the average attendant back then, this was no longer sexual if Shirley was playing at home. Even today, children will enter the beauty contest, many extremely mature clothes, for a three-year-old child. However the child is simply pretending. I don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or the old movies that show this. In all honesty, our media have made many things seem to look sick and wrong. This can sometimes be for the best. But I really believe that this movie is not one of those. It gives a rare look to an innocent mentality, which we have long lost.
