In the hands of a more experienced director, this film would have been considered a masterpiece of horror. Despite the direction of Michael "Death Wish" Winner is simply passable, the film is interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The script uncovers more than a horror clich√© on the back (many can't shake) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens while insisting that mysterious things are going down. Burgess Meredith is as delicious as the insatiable mad neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a hell of a job sitting in a chair. And watch out for a short Chris Walken cameo, unknown at the moment! This film is creepy and creative. The twists and turns are adorable, even if a little predictable. The climax, of which I will not give details, is disturbing and rather impressive. Even in this case a better director could have done more with it, but it is quite satisfying - at least for those with the sensitivity of the horror of the 70s. <br /> <br /> If you like the modern fantasy of torture with body overload, you win I like it There is almost no blood. The management is quite spartan. The effects are few, even if there is a delicious trick near the end - most of which in reality is not the trick ... but maybe I have already said too much. <br /> <br /> I evaluated this a little higher than its quality can justify, but I liked it as much as any "8" movie I saw.
