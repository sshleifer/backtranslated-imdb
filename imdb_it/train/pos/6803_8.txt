In one of his first films, Romy Schneider shines as the young Queen Victoria of Great Britain, when she is suddenly put on the throne at the age of 18, learns to govern despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually fools marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitsch and campy (though surprisingly true to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this film about the English royals spoken in German adds to its distinctive charm. On this front, one wonders why an Austrian film was made about an English queen; but then it is recalled that in 1954, Austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including the British ones. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
