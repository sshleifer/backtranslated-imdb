In the history of comics-based movies, "Mystery Men" is one of the most undervalued. This is not a normal superhero comic movie! Follows the businesses of a diverse group of well-intentioned aspirants, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" mocks various aspects of superhero films such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as concise sayings and questions about secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic domestic lives. It therefore seems that the director Kinka Usher is turning the heroes into something to which the average spectator can refer. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very fun. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
