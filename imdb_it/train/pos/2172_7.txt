"Mad Dog" Earle is back, along with his moll Marie with sad bags, and his caprice Velma. So are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the chewy bastard Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason to remake Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or frame, and to do it with a noticeably lower or lower talent than the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we receive Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on through the end credits.) The only change is that, this time, instead of black and white, he is in Warnercolor ; unfortunately, there are those who could count on improvement. <br /> <br /> I Died A Thousand Times might not be necessary ?? and lower ?? but at least it is not a parody; the story still works in its own way. Earle (Palance), just out of the pen near Chicago, driving west to lead a big job devised by the thug king-jack Lon Chaney, Jr. ?? take down a mountain resort post. During the journey, he almost clashes with an Oakies family when he is struck by their granddaughter; the holder also keeps when he discovers he is lame. Arrived at the cabins where the rest of the gang holes, find the amateur hot heads at the throats of the other as well as Winters, who throws himself against him (as does the dog). While waiting until they receive a call from their man inside the hotel, Palance (in spite of Winter) offers to pay an operation to treat the girl's deformity, a gesture that turns back on her. Thus, the surgical attack against the resort turns into a bloodbath. On the lam, Palance moves higher in the cold Sierras .... <br /> <br /> It is a fairly involving story, performed competently, which lacks the distinctiveness that Walsh and his cast brought him in 1941 , the year Bogie, with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, became a star. And one last heretical note: those mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
