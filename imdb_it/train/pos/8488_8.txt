I just have to pull my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, for the most part the characters are widely written and recited. I can't think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new version, it is on video and airs almost every week. Would I see him in a theater? Of course, I did it when it came out. It's fun ... it should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I don't like it at all, I'd always look at it for Michael Keaton. He is an undervalued and undervalued actor. I can't think of another who is so capable in every genre. Nor can I think of who has success. A comedian who is also an action star (short-lived but firm), who is also a romantic protagonist, who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. I can't think of anyone, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly no one who has succeeded in all those genres. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, but for me it's better to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. However, this is not Michael Keaton against Tom Cruise, so I'll move on. Gung Ho is worth hiring, heck it's worth buying since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less in stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth looking on the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun to watch movies. You can pause your brain and relax and giggle. <br /> <br /> To ask more, according to my honest opinion, he is asking too much.
