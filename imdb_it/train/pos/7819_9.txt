What film! I never imagined that Richard Attenborough could have a movie like that in him. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, apart from the performance of Ben Kingsley, and I never considered the Attenborough a particularly good director. But Cry Freedom has kept my interest as few films have in recent times. It is an exciting and mesmerizing political film with great performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, a South African newspaper editor who befriends civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts as a difficult friendship, because Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist who preaches hatred against whites. But Biko, with his kind words, optimistic attitude and complete transparency, wins over Woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that Woods knew nothing about. <br /> <br /> Biko is a respectable and law-abiding citizen who unselfishly opposes all prejudices and the system that keeps his people. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. The authorities try to silence the issue, because Biko has become a great personality in South Africa. But through Woods efforts the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph becomes just a nightmare, as Woods and his family become targets for the secret police. <br /> <br /> This film has an interesting structure. It actually has two stories: first it tells the life and death of Biko. It is an incredible first time, completely dominated by Washington's charisma in what could be its greatest interpretation. <br /> <br /> The second part, no less interesting, tells that Woods tried to escape from South Africa to publish a book by Biko. Woods has become an enemy of the state, a banned person, which means he can't meet people or leave his country. He is also constantly spied on by the police. Kevin Kline gives a great interpretation also in this second part. <br /> <br /> Although the first semester is fairly simple, the second does interesting things with editing, giving Biko flashbacks and events that show repression against black South Africans. Some might argue that it is to make it more interesting, but for me the second part is just as appealing, as Woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape from South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes were so heartbreaking it was in tears. The soundtrack by George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa certainly had something to do with this. Although I've never been a big fan of Fenton (I can't stand his Gandhi score), I think the soundtrack of Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema. The film, thanks to music married with powerful images, sometimes has reached incredible peaks of emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie to watch due to Denzel Washington. This is a film to love in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This film deserves a place alongside films like The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
