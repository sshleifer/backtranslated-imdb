This film is good for what it is, and unpretentious; However, I wouldn't look at him twice: I'm a Peter Cushing completist and that's why I looked at him. The best resource of this film is BREVITY and EFFICACY. Compared to other similar films, it does NOT drag its feet forever since each of the four (plus one) segments lasts less than 30 minutes, with the last one under 10. Good disturbing vibrations. In the first segment, the horror writer who suffers from the "writer's block" moves into the old isolated house in search of inspiration. He finds it too much when he starts to visualize one of his imaginary fools. Component of the plot similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the point of view of the point of view: the writer gets mentally ill ... or (as the ending shows) the wife of his trophy wants his lover to play with the phobias of her husband to drive him crazy and protect his property .. .yet the intriguing child will survive to enjoy the fruit of his brilliant plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two long-lost friends find themselves in the same old, isolated house but fail to make us visit a bizarre horror museum with the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth, which once he had separated them. From the guardian of the Gothic museum they learn that the portrayed woman is a dead ax wielding a murderer ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was the least interesting for me. <br /> <br /> the fourth shows a horror film actor, who thinks he is the best of all, sunk deep in cheap movies. In search of a costume to give more credibility to his imaginary vampire, he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> Acting is fair, with the 2 initial segments contributing to most of it. Nice film, taken with a pinch of salt. Not the best Cushing, nor Lee ... but it's worth watching.
