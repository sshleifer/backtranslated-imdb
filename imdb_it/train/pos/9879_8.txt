Presenting Lily Mars may have given Judy Garland one of the easiest roles she had while working at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with. A girl with enough talent for ten knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater, no matter how discouraged producer Van Heflin of her city is. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy in this one as the girl determined to do it in the theater. Because it is Judy Garland with the talent of Judy Garland that the public knows she has the right things even if to convince Van Heflin almost the whole movie is convinced. <br /> <br /> Both Judy and Heflin come from the same small town, Heflin's father was the city doctor who delivered her and Heflin while he might have moved in and become a big producer on Broadway, their respective moms , Fay Bainter and Spring Byington have maintained contact. That's his starter, but Heflin is constantly fascinated by shrewd kids, but never anyone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> No real success came out with Presenting Lily Mars for Garland, even though he sings all his numbers. The best of the film is a revival of that chestnut from the gaslight era, Every Little Movement has its own meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist who plays the cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where the Heflin show is produced. Gilchrist was a star at the time of FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in style with Connie. It's the best scene in the film, as Gilchrist encourages Judy to follow him. The composer Karl Hoschna had died a long time ago, but the lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I bet he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> European musical star Marta Eggerth will present Lily Mars as the protagonist Who at first is confused, then angry and, finally, understands Garland and Heflin. She made a couple of films with MGM and then returned to Europe for further work on the continent. I bet MGM didn't know what to do with her and her strong Hungarian accent, even though Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano who he didn't like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin does well as a patient producer who supports a lot from Garland and Eggerth. Heflin had just left the Oscar for Johnny Eager the previous year and he and Garland didn't look like an ideal team, but they're not bad together. <br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is a fine showcase for Judy Garland's talents. And she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage movie with Mickey Rooney.
