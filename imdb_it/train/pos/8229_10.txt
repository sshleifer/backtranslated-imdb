This is a rather slow film, which slowly builds the story of a former stripper who starts a new family life with a complete stranger. The spectator slowly feels that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I loved this film even if it leaves a slight bitter taste at the end. He is intelligent, well structured and very well acted. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply in their characters. <br /> <br /> Even the little son "pierrot" is very touching. <br /> <br /> A thriller that doesn't look like one. A very unconventional film, a very special atmosphere throughout the film, although you may feel uncomfortable a few times with a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give you an 8/10 !!
