This film was fantastic. He had an original concept (that of a vampire movie that meets the mass movie Yakuza). It is a humorous film, but extremely dramatic and tragic about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and subtly commenting on society. From Gackt Camui, the role of Sho was excellent, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured but humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and cried for the carefree character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every single of this film, especially the moments like the Cigarette scene, the fighting scenes and, above all, the heartbreaking ending.
