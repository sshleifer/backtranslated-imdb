Manly, but naive, great Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and rushes to the Big Apple looking for women and big dollars. In New York, JB meets with frustration, and with "Ratso" Rizzo, a cheating but friendly artist. Somehow, this mismatched couple manages to survive each other, which in turn helps them both face a gritty, sometimes brutal, urban America en route to a touching ending. <br /> <br /> Both funny and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" rides head-on into the whirlwind of cyclonic cultural change, thus confirming to the 1969 spectators that they themselves have been swept away by the age of innocence 50s, and dropped, like Dorothy and Toto, in the 1960s Aquarius. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is masterful; the casting is perfect; the acting is first rate; the script is clear and convincing; cinematography is engaging; and the music improves all the above. Deservedly, he won the best Oscar of 1969 and I would vote for him as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade.
