Anyone who has a guy at home who doesn't watch black and white movies should put it on the TV. When the child approaches, wondering what all the screams and screen shots are, tell him this is a picture for adults and that he is not old enough to see it yet. This will keep him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will keep it until the end. <br /> <br /> I think my dad did this to me, anyway, and I'm the best man for that. This classic adventurous yarn, set in India during the British occupation, presents a trio of army sergeants who find their close union in the face of dissolution as they prepare to marry his sweetheart. The help comes in the form of a fierce Thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" was one of the great movies released from the most beautiful year in Hollywood, in 1939. Even more than most great movies of that golden year, it's fun in a way very immediate and accessible. The theme music is instantaneous and humble nirvana. While filming in California, the work with the camera (the only thing in "Gunga Din" that won an Oscar nomination) has a magnitude touched by the wind that looks a lot like the Raj of a hundred years ago. The battle scenes are shot in a very realistic way, not too violent but very confused as people fall and shoot and run in every corner of every frame in a way that looks real, not staged like a Cecil B. DeMille. br /> <br /> The script is not limited to creating action scenes, but also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great humor. The main focus is on the sergeant. Cutter, chasing tales of golden treasures. It's a rare action maker for Cary Grant, and his lightness is right for a film that never takes itself seriously even if it develops a tense tension. <br /> <br /> The trio's anchor is the sergeant. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who bites his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his deer-hare patterns. It's just as fun in its own way, leaving the sergeant. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who shows a nice dash from Errol Flynnish) like the one with the love interest and rooted enough to know that he needs to knock down his friends as a boy and grow up. <br /> <br /> If "Gunga Din" was a Lifetime movie, it concerned Joan Fontaine's efforts to save his man from his two losing friends and their skull that crushed hijinks. But since it's a kid's movie, the emphasis here is on how the trio has to stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not just marriage, but like Cutter exclaims indignantly over and over, even the business some tea. > <br /> The politically correct police is tough in this film, not so much because of the gender issue, but because of the idea of ​​the British soldiers who save the poor Indians from ferocious shooting. It smells like colonial apology. Fortunately, this film was reconstructed when, and therefore the producers did not feel the need to state the evident liberalism in the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of courage and false racial pride, must be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had time for when he sought their approval. After all, despite all their bold glory, the real sacrifice of the film involves the title character, played so heartbreaking by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> When this film was shot, movie magnate Jack Warner said: "You want to send a message, use Western Union." However, it seems that the messages fly fast and furious in "Gunga Din". I look at the movie now and wonder if the spectators at the time were wondering what Gunga Din really was up to when it brought Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really planning revenge against his British masters? Would he have been justified in doing so, especially considering MacChesney's cold treatment for him? When Col. Weed delivers that praise, Rudyard Kipling's poem on which the film is freely inspired, was with a nod in the direction of the madness of imperialism, of dominating over someone who showed "a man better than me "in the end? What have they done of the great speech of the Guru, pronounced in perfect English: "You have sworn as soldiers to die perhaps for a faith, which is your country, England, well, I can die for my country and my faith as a readily like you ... India, goodbye. "<br /> <br /> Of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers:" Kill for the love of killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill! " Which means we can hate him and cheer for the British, and save the questions about what it all means for later. <br /> <br /> What "Gunga Din" means to me, above all, is the fastest, the most thrilling thrill of 90 minutes on the video. Cutter has never found his golden temple, but there is one for all of us who look at "Gunga Din".
