Set in 2017 (although one could easily mistake it for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothes), The Running Man sees the good all-round boy Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he did not commit. After a daring pause in prison, he is captured and entered as a fighter in the brutal TV show The Running Man, along with some escape companions and the beautiful symbolic woman, Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso) ,. <br /> <br /> Used by the totalitarian government as a way to control the masses, the show questions inmates against a series of colorful (and often all-camper) adversaries, each with their own killing style: Dynamo shoot electricity from a special suit, Buzzsaw uses chainsaws, Sub Zero has an ice hockey stick, and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off the contenders. But these killers cannot compete with Ben Richards, who distributes them appropriately and macabre (followed by an ironic joke). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to take revenge on the show's bad host, Killian. Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar dominated the universe of action films and, with his legion of fans, he could do wrong The Austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his films: the comics violence and the plot free from logic plus a rather feminine companion plus witty jokes, less the acting ability amounted to huge profits. The Running Man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to an audience of T and Arnie (mostly male) read it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, and having just finished reviewing the film for the first time in years, I find it a strange film: one totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting and convincing effects, yet in some totally fun way. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (better known as Det. Dave Starsky from the 70-year-old detective show Starsky and Hutch), and adapted from a story by Stephen King (written under the name de plume, Richard Bachman), The Running Man is poor The film of the 80s that seems to be incredibly cheap and very dated, and despite (or perhaps due to) the poor quality of the film, it has a special charm that is hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Without any attempt to create a near realism -Future setting, the film provides many involuntary giggles. Take a look at the scene where Ben discovers Amber's secret cache of tape cassettes (!); admire the disgusting "futuristic" graphics used on billboards and the Running Man board game (as a graphic designer, I found these particularly amusing); be surprised by the clear lack of convincing technological advances. <br /> <br /> The man who runs can be total nonsense, but it is extremely fun to entertain all the garbage that I do not hesitate to recommend to Arnie's fans and to science fiction in general.
