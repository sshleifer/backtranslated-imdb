********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that it was made for a television movie. Only the phrase "made of TV" makes me shudder. The production values ​​for TV movies are almost always lower than the production values ​​for professional film studios. That said, this version of "Christmas Carol" should have been distributed in cinemas, because it's so beautiful. It is my favorite of all "Christmas Carol" films because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor flaws on the screen with two of the ghosts visiting Scrooge, but there is no movie that doesn't have at least a couple of errors. <br /> <br /> Scott shoots a stellar performance like Scrooge, it's a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can't think of a performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded. The costume, outdoor shots and the winter background are mesmerizing. The soundtrack is captivating and warms the heart. Add to that, solid direction, impeccable cinematography and faithful scripting; we have here what one day will be considered a holiday classic. It has never been long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon it will be. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, selflessness and giving. As a selfish and greedy world, my family and I can get lost in "The Christmas Carol", played by George C. Scott.
