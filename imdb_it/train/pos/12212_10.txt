What is the taboo of love ?! People seem to have big problems with transgenerators. <br /> <br /> The title of this film has not caught my attention. It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the film which is what made me stop surfing the channel. I couldn't believe how fantastic this movie was. It touches so many levels of human emotions that it once failed to move me in some way. It is by far one of the best independent films I've ever seen. I have not seen these characters as a genre, only human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Particularly independent films. Praise all filmmakers without fear!
