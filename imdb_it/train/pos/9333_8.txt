Having lived in Ontario all my life, in the same city where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories of her from my parents, grandparents and family. So when I found out that they were going to film a movie about her, and that the beginning would be shot on my way, and her house close enough to mine, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which talks about Marlene Moore, you have a different image of yourself, she was considered strangely beautiful by people who had the chance to meet her, except for her family that often abused her as a child, with the exception of one of her brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you're smart enough to listen to those around you who knew you from school, you'd find that she was really hurt before she even set foot in an institution, she was always on the defensive and what seemed like a reluctance to learning in a school environment was actually embarrassing because she was unable to do so. <br /> <br /> Marlene did not deserve the life she had been given, with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. It was the government and the people around her who further helped her death by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I still find myself angry because she was put in prison for self defense by a man who tried to rape her. As his brother once said, "They didn't know what to do with her so they locked her up and killed her." I believe in it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve it so much.
