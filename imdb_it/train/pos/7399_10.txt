My choice for the best film was Laughton's "Night of the Hunter", which remains exceptional in my fee. But it may have been supplanted by "Shower", which is the most artistically Taoist film I've ever seen. The way in which caring for others is represented by the flow of water, and the way water can be inspired, and comfort, cleanliness and so on is the essence of Dao. It is possible to state that the NOFTH and Shower themes are similar and that Lillian Gish in the former represents the purest form of Christianity as the operators of the beach establishment represent the purest form of Daoism. I will not argue in any way against such an interpretation. Both films are visual joys in their integration of ideas and images. Yet, Shower presents a vision so unpleasant of the sacredness of everyday life that I give it the nod. I revere both.
