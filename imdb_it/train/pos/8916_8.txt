Absolutely the first film that scared me to death. I happened to take it when my older brother (r.i.p.) was watching him. It was on a black and white TV and not really a nice photo, but it interested me. Shortly thereafter, my parents bought a color set and, thankfully, The Million Dollar Movie was showing it on a Sunday. <br /> <br /> I forgot most of the plot, but it didn't take long to recover ... and I got so scared that I had trouble sleeping that night! I mean it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that didn't just come from space, but didn't feel or see it ... and once it grabbed you it was too late. Even now, after all this time, I still get a shiver down my spine. A true classic, and even better a classic that I saw scaring the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Viva The Blob!
