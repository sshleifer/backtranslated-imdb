I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you cannot overcome a person with a strong style of film presence. A Chinese fantasy photo may not be easy to present to an audience, the director tried to bring back the classic fantasy stories of Zu Mountain and this is what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu has really improved since that of 1983. From this new millennium update, we could see Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs, incredible action epic and fantasy done wonderfully well. He kept me glued through the whole picture. Great cast with very fine acting. It's really a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird? <br /> <br /> Now the downside is that people will surely mingle with his shortened narrative line in a 95-minute movie. The plot may not have many relationships between the characters, but by reviewing the film, you will have a better sense of understanding of the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not too much physical combat, as well as with characters endowed with supernatural powers to defeat the enemies, the spirits that fight with the melee have no meaning. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this beautiful elegant image. It may have a subtle story, but looking at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", we also got confused with the plot, but it was really something elegant and fantastic. Tsui Hark always attracts something different in H.K. Cinema. The American public might have some difficulty understanding while watching this film, because it is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this is a completely new genre. Although it might not be a masterpiece, but the special effects are really better than those of Storm Riders. It is really worth a try.
