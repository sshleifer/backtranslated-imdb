Enjoyed this 1936 movie with a lot of veteran classical actors and, in particular, William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and divorced, yet they managed to live together and struggle all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a murder and did everything possible to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur sounds a little crazy and there is a lot of comedies from 1936 and the murder method is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a California track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" gave a great supporting role as a bookmaker along with James Gleason, a detective who needs Dr. Bradford's help to solve this strange mystery of the murder. If you see this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936 and that the audience in those days thought it was great entertainment and it was really in those DAYS!
