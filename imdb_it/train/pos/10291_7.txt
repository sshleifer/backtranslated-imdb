After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that has something positive to say. It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best shows, but it was still OK. Morgan Freeman was right as God. Jennifer Aniston had a good time. I miss Steve Correll in "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like the film choices of director Tom Shadyac. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three of these and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story, it's hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I remember only three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole film. My hypothesis is that the first drafts of the script had more biblical references, but they were cut because the producers were afraid of offending people. Too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My Grade: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
