I discovered that this is the funniest Muppets movie, because I felt it was the most carefree and had the best distribution of comics on most of its lines. The Muppets try to go to Broadway to sell an original musical they wrote, but along the way they run into the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. Although there are not many cameos here as in the original "Muppets Movie", there are some including Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply the timing and delivery of so many lines is fantastic, and the situations in which the Muppets are found are hilarious. Even the original songs are good here and the ending is satisfying. There's not much more to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. This is Muppet's most enjoyable film and will certainly be appreciated by everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
