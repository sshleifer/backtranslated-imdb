After seeing all the films of Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawker, etc. In the fifties, it is quite exciting to see this film with a new perspective from director Ang Lee. The scene of the Lawrence attack in Kansas is fantastic. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is as exceptional as the villain. All the while this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who don't know if they will survive the next few hours. Definitely worth seeing.
