Care Bears Movie 2: A New Generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it a lot. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is trivial and the story is a bit 'badly told sometimes. But Darkheart, while very very dark is a pretty convincing villain, and Hadley Kay did a great job giving him the voice. Speaking of the narrator, it was great, there's nothing wrong with that. The animation is colorful and some of the images in particular at the beginning were breathtaking. The songs and the score are adorable, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my favorite of the two. The bears of care, which I like, are adorable, and even human children are well made. And the ending is a real tear-jerk. All in all, harmless fun for children. 8/10 Bethany Cox
