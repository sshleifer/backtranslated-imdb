What a neglected soundtrack of the 80s. I imagine that John Travolta sang some songs, but watching the movie, he seems to play all that was 80s cheese. Clearly the films that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was his bad Texan accent. Compare it to Friday Night Lights. I suggest looking at Cocktail and Stir Crazy to really start ending up in the movie. Also, as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an incredibly ugly film. I was so shocked to realize that I had never looked at him. Another bizarre film of this kind should include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Remember that all these big stars have played important roles in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
