I thought the guys in the movie were fantastic. I look after children of that age group and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5-year-old child. I didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion on the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is an emerging star. I'd like to see more on the big screen. I liked his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Children of this age group often do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors did all this during the film. I also think that the bullying message should be examined more in films with this age group. Today it is a big problem in schools. <br /> <br /> The ending was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts about winning or not winning the bet were very surprising. How he handled that situation was excellent. Too often children today are not willing to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
