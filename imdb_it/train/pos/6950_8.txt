On the day of the presidential primary in California, between midnight and 1:00 am, the spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and is having trouble at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames his mother for putting Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim and find out that the girl ran away. While trying to solve his domestic problem, Jack is called to his anti-terrorist unit by his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with their boss Richard Walsh, which reveals a threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, who is running for president, they need to find the shooter. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and says there is a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to find the conspirators. When a plane explodes over the Mojave desert, Jack has another problem to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a successful series, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time I watch this show and I confess that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: finding a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and finds his teenage daughter, who is in trouble, trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
