Yes, the poster is a pretty horrible job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was OK ... nothing exceptional ... I was just hoping it would be a hardcore addict and it would completely wipe out his life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but can't this happen to rich children now? Not the son of a wealthy businessman who holds large dance parties and has a beautiful well-kept lawn in front of the mini villa. <br /> <br /> No ... the child is too good to have his life totally destroyed. After all, who will lead the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor rich kids ... in their bizarre house, with their schools of ivy, ultra clean houses and worldly parties ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope they all become addicted to drugs, spend their lives and end up in prison ... so maybe we can see films that don't all revolve around the poor, small and rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
