I'll be honest with you, I was in high school when the sitcom was first broadcast on ABC. I didn't think I'd like it at all. But with John Ritter in it I felt he had a little potential in it, plus theirs was something else with what I liked. The acting was great, not a lot of horrible second grade comedy lines, John Ritter always brings his game A when it comes to comedy. This was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father who never looks at sitcoms, only looks at movies, sports, law and order, sat with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother and myself, and watched the show that I think because John Ritter was in it . I honestly think that this show would still be running if John Ritter God rested his soul, I wish he hadn't died.
