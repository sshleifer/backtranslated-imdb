My daughter really gets caught when I refer to Drew Barrymore as having been hit in the face by a pan, not to mention her chin Dudley Dooright for which Jay Leno would have died. How wonderful, then, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet and light comedy. To be absolutely stereotyped, the girls will appreciate the film for its romantic charm and the vulnerability of Jimmy Fallon, and the boys will like it for all the male connection and the representation of the sports mania. <br /> <br /> My sporting attacks my wife, my teenage daughter, and we all found something similar in the movie. This says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half or so, and it's probably also a good date.
