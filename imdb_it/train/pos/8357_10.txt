A wonderful film, free, often lyrical that drags you around, always smiling, even if there are really shocking incidents along the way. One fascinates the way women are treated and yet they seem to come along very well and it is a great credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so well. This is probably Depardieu's best performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs exceptionally well in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is adorable in everything and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this looks like a cursed and dirty misogynist, but while the story and the characters unfold, a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film requires respect.
