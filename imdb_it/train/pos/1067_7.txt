Like many pilots in the series, the opening of Dark Angel shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem in finding one's feet. Not that this is in any way unusual, but one gets the feeling that it could have worked better if the story had been strengthened and focused a little more. In today's world, where something has to light up instantly or be erased, the series has done a bit of disservice by not leaving at least halfway, with all the guns on fire. <br /> <br /> The ninety-minute pilot really looks like two episodes were glued together, and both episodes have a focus problem. In the first half of the year, we are introduced to Max and we are busy with what the guide is doing. We also have some interesting routines with Max that uses his skills to win bets, interact with a PI or solve domestic problems for his colleagues. The problem here is that this is nothing extraordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise. <br /> <br /> It is when we get to the second half that we get a story with a purpose and attention. During the two halves, Max is the center of attention of a pirate journalist who believes it is a mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty retailer at a time. In the second part, the repercussions reach him and Max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess. This establishes the premise for the rest of the series, and it works, but it's not enough to click if you get my meaning. It is as if most of the pieces were there, but a couple making a complete image was left out. Maybe they fill up with subsequent episodes, but that's not the point. The fact is that the content of this episode could easily have been told with twenty-eight minutes less. <br /> <br /> The last of the negatives is that many of the supporting casts are totally indifferent. In particular, original Cindy is a nuisance, and I doubt it changed during the next twenty episodes. While acting is not as bad as daytime soap, it is not of such quality that I would praise it. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but fails to convince when the story needs less. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the premise and production values ​​are all of the highest quality. In fact, this series was considered rather expensive to produce, and it is rather unfortunate that it was canceled to be replaced by another show that did not last a whole season. Especially when there was a lot of time for both shows - they could have simply deleted one of the junk pieces that pile up under the reality TV banner. The fact is that we need more shows like Dark Angel, where imagination rather than overhype is used to attract attention. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave the Dark Angel pilot a seven out of ten. He never rises above the level of disposable television, and has never had the chance to live up to the potential he shows in his running time. But the potential is there, and often it is all that matters where the pilots are involved.
