Beyond the excellent direction, the production, the acting and the predictable drama contain an essential message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listen to the road to the end" In order for the voice to prosper, listen. To harmonize with others in voice, listen. To get closer, listen. To find out the needs of any situation or other, listen. It seems that the writers are transmitting a "secret of life". Listening leads to awareness of one's Self. It awakens the other senses, especially the vision and expands the horizon. Even someone's soul can be discovered. The art of this film "As it is in the heavens" has magnificently shown the unfolding of life, not only its joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this with the first instructions of the protagonist at the choir; <br /> <br /> "Listen, lead to the end"
