I remember seeing this film as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it until late at night when they were the only payment channel for the existing cinema. Back then it was UNRATED and it was the only film of its kind ever shown on pay-TV ... especially at the time. I would like to see him now as an adult, where I would be more inclined to understand the adult theme of it. It was probably the closest thing I'd ever seen on pornography at the young age of 7 or 8. Fortunately I had stupid babysitters and festive parents on the weekends. Most of my memory of this film was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two boys. Breaking homes to sniff underwear, feeding on a stranger's mother's milk on a public bus and fornicating in a taxi at the request of one of their women were just some of the escapades these guys were doing. A very lively film for the early 1970s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had a similar following. Most people I talk to have never heard of it.
