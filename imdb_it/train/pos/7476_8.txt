I can really say that I heard the film in its true essence where the mind games of dreamlike reality enter the surreal aspect of the future faced by Tom Cruise. I didn't care much about Tom Cruise's feats but I have to say that he seems to impress at every point of the film ... not simply because of a compelling storyline, but also because it was assigned to the protagonist. .. they come together and then they talk and it's beautiful. However, I must say that this film is not part of the "average movie of the weekend" that you choose at random and look cheerfully; Bring strong feelings and characters, so don't wash this with your beer and popcorn. He certainly needs more.
