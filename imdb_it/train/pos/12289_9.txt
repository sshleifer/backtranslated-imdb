First of all, I would like to point out that I did not read the book, so there was no chance of being disappointed with this aspect. The main flaw that I noticed was the historical detail, with different cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think it does not belong to that moment. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the film is ok, nothing to brag about. But the acting, I think, was fantastic. I have no experience in acting, I still can't believe how people can consider this terrible! Perhaps they only saw two films (always), and the other must have been really very good! <br /> <br /> I particularly liked Jeremy Irons, and I really understood his character, someone who has crawled on the social ladder with a very hard job, then fights against those who take away his life's work, just him he is so involved in this fight, he does not realize that the reason is no longer on his side, and ends up with a defeated and disappointed man. Irons made him so believable, I sympathized with the character despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also as wonderful as a romantic young woman, who is attracted by the revolutionary ideals of her boyfriend (Banderas, had an underdeveloped part, I think), and even Glenn Close was very good boy. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, but not up to the other actors. Pay attention to Miguel Guilherme, a good Portuguese actor, among many stars. <br /> <br /> Contrary to today's films, here only the interpretations, only people count, but at the same time, it is not a pretentious film, too worried trying to be intellectual. The best proof I really liked, I'm writing a review 7 years later.
