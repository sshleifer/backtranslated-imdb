This is a wonderful film about the Mormon struggle and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are particularly powerful, and the message is one we must all remember: God does not speak, but communicates, if we only listen. While I am writing this amidst the horrors happening in New Orleans and the surrounding area because of Katrina, I was particularly moved by the fact that Mormons had to leave everything behind and move on after Joseph Smith was assassinated. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, yet it was not possible. The struggle of the Mormons to cross the country, the cost of lives, the difficulties they have suffered has been truly impressive, demonstrating their enormous strength. As for the real beliefs of the Mormons, this is not very thorough, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not at all a fulcrum of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is top notch, although others have commented to know more about real characters and can talk about how real portraits were. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell all do excellently with the script that was given to him. <br /> <br /> Although the film could easily have stood alone (and certainly today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell have been added to the cast to bring the crowd into theaters to watch a Mormon film. Power is magnificently beautiful as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but remains with his family after his father was killed. Power doesn't have much to do until the end of the film, when it has a great scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, even though they are a lovely couple. Their fate is unclear about his conversion, and one questions himself about polygamy in their case. Neither can be beaten, however.
