This is the kind of movie for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go on with its business while you go down in a big armchair and soft for a couple of hours. Wonderful shows by Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) rowing gently along the plot. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a hot and witty paddle through the life of New York at its best. A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it has received.
