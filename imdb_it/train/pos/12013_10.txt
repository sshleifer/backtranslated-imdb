After reading the comments on this film and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to add my ten cents to say that I thought the film was excellent, not only in visual beauty, writing, music, acting and directing but in telling the story of Joseph Smith and his path he went through the life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew how to be his way. I am very happy, in fact, to have had a small part in telling the story of this extraordinary man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she is walking, this only instills one with more determination to live the life we ​​should with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness as the Salvatore doing.
