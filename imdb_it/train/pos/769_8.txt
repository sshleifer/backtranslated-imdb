Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 film, Beat Street, is undoubtedly the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger brother, a graffiti artist and a show-wanna promoter in a winter in which they try to get out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The acting is not always up to par and the characters are not completely drawn, but they are more than compensated for by a down-to-earth dialogue, a plausible story, fantastic dance sequences and a timeless hip-hop sound track. It should be noted that this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdance ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!"), And presents the appearances of the fathers of breakdance, of the Rock Steady Crew dance company and of rapper Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew provides the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the first breakdancing club of the early 1980s, the Roxy. Must see for hip-hop lovers.
