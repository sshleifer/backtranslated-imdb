If you haven't seen this little dark charmer, you should look for it. It's the story of a bizarre Sad Sack, in wartime (Fred MacMurray) who is listed 4-F every time he tries to join any branch of the army. Find a magic lamp that naturally contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more turbulent than MacMurray, sending him through time to serve in all the wrong moments and places than he wants. She is pretty, cheerful and pure, and you can't help but like it. The plots are very similar to those of a Disney movie, in particular since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) have made numerous Disney films in the 50s and 60s, though not together. Needless to say, everything ends well for everyone and the viewer goes pretty well.
