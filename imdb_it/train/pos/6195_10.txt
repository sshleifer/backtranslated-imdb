After watching this movie months ago, it continues to jump into my consciousness and I feel that I have to buy it or at least see it again, even though I watched it at least 3 times when I rented it there. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with the direction of Hal Hartley many years ago - I discovered that these films could make me laugh in a place that is rarely entertained. It's a strange feeling, taken for granted, and I assume that most people out there just don't understand, or make them feel confused and rather uncomfortable - I guess I really understood - it's as if these films were made for me. <br /> <br /> Although I don't remember if I actually laughed loudly during this film, it remains one of the funniest movies I've seen in many years. If you don't see the shopping bag humor that Fay brings from the street to the church, to his brother's editor's office, to his son's principal's office, you may not have the intelligence to be very impressed with this movie . The bag is a silent character in itself, dragged around like an icon of motherhood that Parker Posey, usually brazen, bitch has to endure before the international intrigue of the rest of the film assists her. <br /> <br /> I consider "Henry Fool" my favorite of Hartley's films. I honestly don't remember it very well - I think the character himself was so despicable that I found it boring. Hartley's fort seems to be the development of the female character. <br /> <br /> In addition to the splendor of Posey, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn again, one of my favorite actresses. His extravagant naivety is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make the scandalous trivial helps define his style as a delightful chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film explodes into a major international plot, explaining political situations in Afghanistan. This is never suspected in the beginning. The complexity of the development of this film is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> This is the epitome of an "independent" sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more the mystery is turned around him, the less you think about his appearance towards the end of the film - like a machine to denounce alcoholic smoke, throwing insults at his Islamic terrorist guardian who somehow seems to respect him. It's like discovering that Santa is actually a 12-year-old bully in a school. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and satisfied by the other recent Hartley films "Monday Girl" and "No Such Thing", "Fay Grim" goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality that no Oscar winner would ever have dared.
