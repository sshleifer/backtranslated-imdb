How many of us want to be able to throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Many of us, I suspect. Let's Dance? it's not a dance film. It is about knowing ourselves, recognizing what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is considered an inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of a dancing acadamia window. he is fascinated by her and eventually enrolls in dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dance and is afraid of ridicule. It hides the fact that he attends dance classes with colleagues and relatives. <br /> <br /> There is a hilarious scene in the office mensroom when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a dancing buddy also, are interrupted while practicing dance moves. There are many other fun and warm scenes. <br /> <br /> The ending is not a fairy tale, but lets the spectator feel good. <br /> <br /> This film helped me understand Japanese people a little better. It is a hot and very useful movie to watch.
