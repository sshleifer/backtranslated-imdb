Even one of the funniest of John, Eugene Levy, is great in this too, I just wish the studio would understand that this must be on DVD, I recorded it on video tape, but I feel that this film deserves the DVD (and the extras would be great) the scene of Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) is so funny, like the whole film, even the scenes he has with his girlfriend and his family are fantastic, this movie never seems to be on TV, but loses the most of its hilarity, when mounted to broadcast the TV, if you can find the video I suggest you buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy) I will keep my VHS until one day we will see it on DVD. there are so many great movies out there that haven't been released on DVD yet, and this is one of them.
