I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know about four times as much (I doubt I learned so much from Not Without My Daughter (1991). <br /> <br /> Offside is a splendid Iranian comedy on a budget of a group of girls (working individually) to participate in a decisive football match for their country's place in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to participate in football matches, so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save all women trying to enter by themselves. girls (teenagers?) They try to crash the party by dressing up as boys, but they are captured.The film is mostly set in this enclosure where the girls are held by soldiers, waiting for an unspecified punishment (even if the girl dressed as a soldier claims to have been one of the insignia far from being executed!) <br /> <br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation: the thought that blocks women from football games it comes down to being too vulgar an experience for the fairer sex - a philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to the head when a girl has to go to the bathroom, so a soldier that the escort asks to cover his eyes to not see the graffiti. The conflict does not entirely concern the battle of the sexes: at a certain point there is a friction between a soldier who is rural and the girls who are urban. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film was not too culturally esoteric the comedy was lost on this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be in the mood to do it, but nobody should avoid this movie because they think they won't understand it.
