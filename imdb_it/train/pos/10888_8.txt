This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that the money is not enough, so he rents the family that lives where he thought his family did. ok? This is a great high school soap, PG-13, but the small sexual references are comedy, so if your child can't handle them, they can't even live in the real world. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a hunk, and as usual he walks through this amusing, OMG, he remembers when we did it ..., a piece of ensemble as if it were in the final stages of some neuroinfective diseases. But that's okay, because even this old Oracle continues to hope that if Ben is so well proportioned, well, there is still hope for us women. Fortunately, the rest of the group - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fill and maintain this dark side - Ozzie and Harriet Christmas alternately exhilarating, comfortable and warm. <br /> <br /> This movie is the type you can jump and take popcorn, and when you come back, everyone wants to back up to show you what you've missed. <br /> <br /> This is, after all, a happy film and makes you feel good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
