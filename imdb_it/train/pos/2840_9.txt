I just saw a press screening of this film and was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that you see all my favorite actors in a movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I really liked the pocket pick scene and it was nice to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden getting back together. I think their camera chemistry is the direct result of their leisure time together. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) the piece by Bret Ratner ... Without giving too much space, I will only say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> old couple were really good together and you actually felt like you had spent a lifetime together. <br /> <br /> Both the Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke segments filled a handful of surprises that seem realistic and similar to the experiences I had in the big apple. Overall, the film is a great place to make an appointment ... especially if you're already passionate about the city itself. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next in the Cities of Love.
