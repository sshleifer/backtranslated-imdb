And also for TV movies, this film was good. the acting in it and the plot was so great. this is one of the only films I saw that I felt deformed by my mind because after seeing it I was afraid that Reaper would come and kill me through the screen of my computer. There were only a few small things that were not right in this movie, but it is very simple to see. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr played an excellent role in this film with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie has a lot of suspense and made me want more because I never thought that a low-budget TV movie could be so powerful. After seeing this, I read the novel on which this film was based (four times) and it was also kicked. If I ever saw this movie coming on TV, I'd watch it. The effects in this film were well done, I honestly don't know what a live human being would be like but with the way the FX team made this film I was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad guys are made TV movies out there on a low budget shouldn't be so lousy. <br /> <br /> look at it. It's really good, not really, it is!
