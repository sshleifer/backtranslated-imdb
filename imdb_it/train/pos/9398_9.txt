This is an excellent modern film noir .... "excellent" as it is interesting from beginning to end. There are some holes here and some silly parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ..... but I haven't found anyone who hasn't been involved in this story. The film has the right amount of action, suspense, twists and interesting characters. In addition, it shows some beautiful colors and cinematography as well as a good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I called this criminal film a "film noir" because it is gritty and all the characters are not good. Even the only alleged good boy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets into trouble lying and has a quick relationship he shouldn't have. In the end he does something that isn't right, but I'm not going to ruin it by saying. Suffice it to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad as to make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys", does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the "unbalanced" category, it's hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a lot of reasons. J.T. Walsh also offers another great support performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that never got much publicity, but should have. You'll have fun watching this. By the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times quickly without ruining it!
