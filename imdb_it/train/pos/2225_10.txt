I am completely shocked that this show has been canceled. I lasted only a year. I just started watching it and I love it. It's a show that has managed to reach friends. He had humor and was extremely funny. <br /> <br /> There are about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under the same roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the part of the older brother and takes on the more paternal role. <br /> <br /> This should last much more than a year as it was fantastic. Incredible show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
