I think this film has a low rating because it was judged by its worst moments. There is a joke about diarrhea and an embarrassing scene, but other than that there are actually some moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee is performing a wonderfully subtle comedy in this film and Julia Stiles manages to be really damn funny. Apart from the fact that this film behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes from the beginning you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, the best movies to watch but certainly not the worst choice ... Greetings
