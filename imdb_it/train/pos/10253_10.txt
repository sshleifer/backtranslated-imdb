This film has no history. It's just a group of kids torturing an innocent young woman to death. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> This is what they do: they beat her, put her in a net and leave her hanging in like bird food, turn her over a chair until she vomits, expose her to loud noises, pour hot oil over her of her, put worms in her sores, crush her with a hammer and at the end a needle appears through her eyes. <br /> <br /> This film was so realistic that if I didn't know it was fake, I would have thought it was a sniffing movie. Although I was disgusted with this film, I loved it. It scared me. I guess it fills some kind of purpose. I give him a 10/10.
