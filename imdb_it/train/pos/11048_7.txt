I didn't think this movie was as smart as it seemed to think, but we liked it anyway. <br /> <br /> It is original, although it reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mainly for the color but also for the angularity of the close-ups of the characters. /> <br /> Set in a prison cell, but don't let this discourage you, this film seems to go beyond a multiple of successes. <br /> <br /> Interesting, with the 'Black Arts' perennials well to the fore and excellent characterization making some just too believable! <br /> <br /> Scary with a little blood this is worth a visit.
