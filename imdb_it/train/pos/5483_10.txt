I really liked "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised". Once again, it gave me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that twenty percent of rich citizens in Venezuela have made all the decisions for eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when their coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, and the Constitution, and the Mediator, and electoral commissions, and all civil rights, nobody took the conspirators behind a barn somewhere and shot them. They didn't even go to jail. The main conspirators live in Florida, continuing. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" approved by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just the story that bites. Democracy can give you a pinch of hell if you let it go. And in Venezuela it is free.
