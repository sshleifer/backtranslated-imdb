If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before, ... (IS IT POSSIBLE?) ... surely they knew who they were looking for! <br /> <br /> This show went on to win 5 Emmys, & stands out as one of the best things Streisand has ever done. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra singing standards from room to room, full of musicians, including a segment where is again a young girl, ending with a splendid version of her songwriting, (at the time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour by Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings poverty songs. it is better than it seems ... <br /> <br /> ACT III .... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and a "Funny Girl" medley .... <br /> <br /> all things considered , a big part of the history of television, made by one of the greatest artists in the world!
