A prison cell. Four prisoners: Carrere, a young director of the company accused of fraud, a 35-year-old transsexual in the process of her transformation, Daisy, an idiot of twenty years mentally ill and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intelligence who killed his wife . Behind a stone slab in the cell, mysteriously pulled away, they discovered a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly allow escape prisoners "Malefique" is one of the most disturbing and intelligent horror films I've seen this year. The film has a dirty and dark feeling, influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft, which creates a very disturbing and disturbing atmosphere. There is a good dose of cold blood in imaginative and brutal scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette has made a truly horrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his fantastic debut.9 out of 10.
