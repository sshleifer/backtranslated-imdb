I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can't understand why some people say it's not. Boring....??? Perhaps the one who said that it is boring is because he / she is boring. She is a great actress and the film was excellent. He has many wonderful ideas and excellent interpreters. The management was fantastic. I imagine myself in the French environment with all the refinement and the perfume, the flowers, the churches, the problems, etc. When he goes to his sister's shop he is simply amazing. It's all great. We have a very good, wonderful, longtime actress. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like it more than in his next film LA SCIENCE DES RÃ‰VES. And Eric Lartigau did a great job. <br /> <br /> Ana
