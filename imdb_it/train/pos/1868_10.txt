This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many people he grew to become a respectable person. What's more is that this is a true story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and has never cheated on women, cokes, cigars, grass, alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places where she was growing up. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say about this film, it's excellent. The only evaluation I can give is a 10/10.
