I found this a fascinating adaptation, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of a couple of major mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to echo some of the previous comments: Chynna Phillips is horribly misplaced as a teenager. At 27, he is simply too old (and, yes, he does show), and he misses the song "chops" for Broadway style music. Vanessa Williams is a pretty decent singer and, for a non-dancer, is adequate. However, she is NOT Latina, and her character is definitely. She is also very STRIDA, which becomes boring. <br /> <br /> Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie fan girls really shine - with special compliments to Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also liked the performance of Tyne Daly, although I'm not generally a fan of his work. Finally, the dancing Shriners are a riot, especially the three crappy bars. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
