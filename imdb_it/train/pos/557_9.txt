While driving from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a couple of years ago and I was impressed by the scenery, I can't help wishing that this film, even if it has a nice color and panoramic views, would have been shot in position current. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place, but it is not yet the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves on to Dawson, it is when I hear that Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor locations so well, could have made the most of it if he had filmed in the real place. James Stewart is again a man who fights within himself, a part of him does not want to be involved and help the people who hinder his earnings, and the other part is not able to take his eyes off the killed people. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who doesn't care who she passes, Corinne Calvet is the good girl. Mann is excellent at directing the shootout, but the high point of the film is how well he does in outdoor scenes. He uses the outside as much as he can and is helped by the winter scene, the predominant white, as he was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the brown in "The Man From Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's more complex character.
