I have been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years, and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work, thanks to the Jennifer Baichwal documentary. The severe beauty of the Bangladesh shipyard, the Vermont stone quarry, the huge assembly plant in China, the cramped old quarters of Shanghai just waiting to be cut down: these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the director. Sometimes I thought of old television documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories; the kind of thing I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work has the great value of emphasizing how industrial activity has only moved to Asia, it has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the computer yard somewhere in China: the garbage looked threatening, while the workers were very jovial.
