"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical tale, a heroic story and an overview of the cultural background of a great event in history. Denzel Washington not only does a terrific job to impersonate a motivated and determined hero, Steve Biko, but also broadcasts a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican's Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main "influence", Donald Woods, is heartbreaking. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to communicate to the public the optimistic appearance of the apparently disturbing plot. It is because of great films like this that the public can be educated about terrible events in history, great leaders who have tried to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is a fantastic film that should be seen by everyone.
