I got passionate because apparently ABC licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was a surprise because it was a break from listening to something Chinese. But I started to get back on my feet, as the cast and story lines are just enough and thoughtful in NYC. Nothing too incredible, even though I think it's very stereotypical of them to write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet !!!! This was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad to learn on IMDb that I can't wait to watch the second season when I return to the United States. I am equally disappointed with the other commentators that this has shown many promises, quality and taste. But just like the shows that show characters approaching, it's probably more difficult for people to watch if the beginning looks at different episodes in. Which is apparently a little too late for the eager networks.
