I am currently doing film studies at A.S level and "this is not a love song" is a film we have seen and, in my opinion, it is a film with a very simple plot but a complex background plot. If you scratch the surface, you will find a thriller-chase film of two men running through the countryside from the peasants, after committing a murder: - "it looks pretty exciting". <br /> <br /> However it is necessary to dig deeper to discover the true feeling of the true genre. As has been suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of trust, deceit and betrayal. We are not told about this "love" directly through the film, but the events that happen through, for example the way Heaton acts against Spike almost screams this pristine love story in the face. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "junk" just because they are made on a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good film with an intricate plot, however it is certainly an acquired taste and is probably not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood hits.
