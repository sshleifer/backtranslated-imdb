I have to give How She Move an almost perfect evaluation because the content is truly exceptional. As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this film was on the list of IMDB's 100 bottom lists! This is absolutely ridiculous! Other films, particularly those that share the theme of dance, fail to contain a candle for this in terms of a combination of high-level acting, credible interpretation and extraordinary dance routines. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to finish the background story (it is not just about winning a competition) it is very easy to investigate, and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this is of 2 dimensions and, at the end of the film, it is very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And, even if you're not the type to cry, you might have a few tears in your eyes before the credits come out.) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to dance lovers and, again more, to those who can appreciate a touching and well made plot. Obviously How She Move is not perfect (which film is it?), But it is definitely a film over the movies that uses beautiful faces to hide a plot and / or semi-automated characters without substance. The actors and settings of this film represent a very realistic ride that is equally compelling thanks to the extraordinary talent of the dancers!
