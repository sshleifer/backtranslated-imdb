Basically, the film could be one of the most fascinating titles made by one of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's go straight, the film deserved its hype as one of the most elegant actioners / thrillers ever made. <br /> <br /> When it comes to unhappy tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts are truly a perfect couple. Both this film and Deja Vu are the best thrillers you can expect. Washington really really felt comfortable with unstable cameras and all the scenes in the film. One would be easily related to the emotions of his character so he enjoyed all the murders on the road. It is a success that they have created a super-dark Mexican city with a lot of crap. One would be easily convinced by the extent of the corruption described in Man On Fire. I don't know what the Mexicans would think when they look at this ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's say it again. It is among the best of the Death Wish genre, but it has also suffered from a great deal of violence. It's a little annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the film very realistic and lets Denzel Washington interpret the kind of tragic hero of the "lost sheep". In the end, they even got the kidnapper fired in his pool like a documentary. I was checking on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for this ... So this is for your consideration if you also find that the movie's theme is a bit fake. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope you can't take this movie for real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for art direction / editing / film / Denzel Washington.
