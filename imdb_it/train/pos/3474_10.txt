This film deserves to be seen alone for John Lennon's exceptional portrait of Jared Harris. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't look exactly like Lennon; his manners, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lennon in a local bar that verbally argues with a stuttering fan that Paul McCartney & Wings' "Silly Love Songs" is worthy of # 1 status in America.
