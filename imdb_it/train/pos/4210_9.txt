I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were first-rate, including the most important, for me anyway, the script and the acting. This is certainly one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could have played this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. He has impressed so much here that I will definitely be looking for his other job. Thelma Ritter, in an inelegant role, earned the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. This film works on all levels. Black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have a great chemistry in their difficult romance. Strongly recommended, 9/10.
