This film has excellent acting from almost the entire cast, a compelling story with a chilling finish, great music and excellent images without significant special effects. It is interesting to note, however, that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future do not seem likely to be present. This does not mean that we are still out of the woods, but 2022 is now obviously too early to be in this condition. He shares this failure with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: A Space Odyssey" (compare his space station with our International Space Station) and "I Robots" by Isaac Asimov (the positronic brains had to to have been invented in the 1990s).
