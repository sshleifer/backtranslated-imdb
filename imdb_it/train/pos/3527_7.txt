Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. He agrees on the condition that they don't exchange any information with each other - not even the names. Sometimes these are the best types of dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. His alibi is the mysterious woman, but no one can remember seeing her, and as a result of this, Scott is condemned to die for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and proposes to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas's attempts to reach the truth. We follow her through some memorable scenes, for example, her search for Mac the bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic place where Cliff the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) takes her to go out, drink and dance while kissing with his friends . This is such a blatant description of sexual desire that it is a strong part of the film, since everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically throughout the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good at being a female lead and Thomas Gomez is a nice cop. Alan Curtis started well as a confused and innocent man, but once arrested, his performance took a turn to the left as it became completely unpleasant in Kansas without reason. God knows why she stayed with him. <br /> <br /> The film does not let you guess who the murderer is as we know about half the movie, but that doesn't matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, how we'll do Kansas to find out what's going on and then get out! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but even if Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I never like anything in anything I see .... someone gives me a tie .....
