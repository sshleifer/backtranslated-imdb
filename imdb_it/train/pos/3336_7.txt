I have to admit that I entered Fever Pitch with low expectations. It is not a great revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's latest film (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and that Fever Pitch's trailers were fine, but they didn't hypnotize me. I was already preparing some baseball games for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was a shocking one in his film career .. Well, now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! one shot, and get back to SNL! "or" Buy some peanuts and crackers, but don't buy Fever Pitch tickets. You'll leave the theater and never come back! " Then the film had to go and be a lot more fun than I expected. But hey, I couldn't let my word games go to waste, right? Another reason I thought I wouldn't care about the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. The mere mention of the name of Pedro Martinez sends me running to the bathroom. Oh man, wait ... <br /> <br /> ... All right, I'm back. However, my mother, who is a fan of St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the World Series was rigged last year. He refuses to believe that the Sox have legitimately won it. But I am man enough to admit that Fever Pitch made me sympathize, albeit slightly, with the sad plight of Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a passion for sports will be able to relate to this film on a certain level. Unless you have a favorite sports team, you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan like Fallon's Ben can cross. There is nothing as fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing as smooth as a clean slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It is the joy of being a sports fan. "Wait until next year", it becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures that essence. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the film takes a fantasy story and throws it against the The real life scenario of the unlikely Red Sox World Series is scheduled last year. I don't love him so much that I want to marry him, but you know what I mean. I expected this to be handled fairly roughly, and while some humor is a bit silly, it is actually quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 and when he died he left Ben with his two passes. Ben has not lost a game in 23 years. At the start of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who should go to which games with him. He makes everyone dance for the Yankees games and every time someone complains he threatens them with tickets to the Royals games (sorry Mr. Shade) and the Devil Rays. It's a very good scene, and it works so well because I actually know the people who do the "ticket draft day". I must also admit that I can identify myself when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and his parents. The Red Sox are playing a game on the road, but instead of watching it live on TV, Ben decides to record it. One of the most dangerous things in life is to record a game and then be in public and try to avoid hearing the result. Been there. It is a very tense and frightening situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and starts screaming like a banshee so as not to hear the result. Lindsey is embarrassed and her parents don't know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be strange, I don't deny it. But it's real. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect the crude and angular stuff that the Farrelly brothers are known for, you may be disappointed. They have their moments though, like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes speaks to her side of the mouth "like a lovely victim of a blow", but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side than the bros are showing off. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film becomes too boring. Fortunately, when the sap begins to ooze a little, the Farrellys know when to retreat. A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the field and running towards Ben to declare that his eternal love for him turns into Ben answering sincerely: "You have to talk to me about the outside field. Is it spongy?" Jimmy Fallon demonstrates that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comic charm. Fever Pitch is just a good and solid entertainment that looks a bit new in the romantic comedy genre. It's a movie that both boys and girls can relate to. In particular the boys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the women who have to take care of them. <br /> <br /> Now, if Red Sox fans could close their "Child Curse" I would appreciate it. My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my situation bigger of your. <br /> <br /> THE GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sports fanaticism in general should consider taking a look at Fever Pitch. I would not freak out to run and see it at the first available hour, but it will be a great matinee. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)
