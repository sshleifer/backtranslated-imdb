Well, well ... Roeg's got a little nervous, right? He was a genius while cataloging the descents of his various characters in psychosis for a couple of decades, but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) could be found in the bad old Catholic church, the crowd of hipper-than-thou alternative films get really bad. Worse still, the character of Theresa Russell - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist perspective has an explanation, is involuntarily forced to face those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, the kind of thing movie house art lovers should be above. Oh, the horror ... So he finds his marriage - the idea that it could be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortable like a divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive may perhaps wonder why, instinctively, they jump into attack mode to be challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably won't. Of course, this film has some problems, in particular the delirium of Talia Shire like the pointed nun, 50s style clothing and all the rest. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is directly from the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (although Hitchcock's film escaped such accusations because of the source of wisdom that has impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have met with a critical attack just for having even asked the question and for the possible answers that this film presents.
