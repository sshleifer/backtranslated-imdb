This is a really nice and sweet film that the whole family can enjoy. These are two dogs and a cat that are taken away to live with someone else for a while, but the animals do not understand and run away and go looking for the family alone. The cat is called Sassy and she lives up to its name. The case is the younger dog that knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is the oldest and wisest dog that feels things. Put those three together in an adventure and it becomes a happy and fun time. There are no special effects of moving mouths, so it is not cheese at all. It's the best talking animal film I've ever seen so far. It's a really good movie for families.
