I used to write comments on IMDb, but I don't do it anymore. What happens is that IMDb has become huge, and consequently subjectivity has ruined the scores. What I mean? That anyone who is not particularly fond of movies and has no experience in the field, observes some crap (or the opposite), and if he likes it, he delivers a 10, and if he does not he goes to 1. This of course cannot measure nothing correctly. Now for the movie. I'm really sorry I delivered a few tenths to some very few films, because then I have to mark this with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I never expect to see again in my whole life in any other film. It is simply fascinating and not just a way of saying; really. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the protagonist boys - which in reality ... there is no possible match. I don't keep films, I would rarely make sense in doing it, but this is the kind of movie you should buy and keep, and from time to time watch them, maybe 10 or 20 times with years. I have nothing else to say. This is a real 10 goal for me.
