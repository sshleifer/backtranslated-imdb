It's been a long time since I saw this LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is completely faithful to the original work. The images are captivating and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Occasionally, the film is confused or confused. There are one or two times when the plot slows down to a crawl. But overall, buy this movie. It is great for children, adults and collectors.
