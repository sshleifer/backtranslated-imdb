*** SPOILER *** Even too much, in real life as in the movies, a family story that happens to many young people who are put in a war zone with a gun or a gun in their hands. The case of young and innocent people, who have never manipulated or fired a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like Jimmy Davis have been forced to take up arms for their country . > <br /> Jimmy who at first wanted to be expelled from the United States army but was encouraged to remain, being tied up in his mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, who ended up on the front line in France. With Jimmy's unit nailed by a German machine gun, he put it out of use by half a dozen German soldiers from the security of a nearby church bell tower. It was when Jimmy killed the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery bullet hit the bell tower, severely injuring him. <br /> <br /> Recovering from his injuries in a military hospital, Jimmy fell in love with US Army Volunteer Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend, the lucky lucky, despite his hateful antics towards her. It was when Fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that Rose, thinking he had been killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French city where Jimmy, now completely cured of his injuries, was stationed, it became very sticky for him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy's marriage proposal with her! <br /> <br /> With the First World War and Jimmy who marries Rose leaves Fred, who is still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred met Jimmy in the streets of New York and discovered with amazement and surprise that he had completely transformed himself from the gentle and non-violent person he knew before being sent to war on the Western European Front. Pleased and confident, and of his ability to shoot with a gun, Jimmy had become a massacre in the New York underworld! Not only that, but later Fred discovered that his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved with Jimmy by telling her that he worked as a respectful and inoffensive law regulator. <br /> <br /> Jimmy's criminal life certainly arrived, when Rose, after discovering his secret life, reported him to the police to prevent him from performing a "Valentine's Day" as a massacre, with his members of the band dressed as policemen, of its mafia rivals. While he was on trial, Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after being sentenced for three years, he resumed his life. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** Hearing rumors from other inmates that Rose and her best friend Fred had a relationship behind her, Jimmy got out of prison ending up being a fugitive from the law . It is at Fred's circus, where he works both as a crib and a salesman, that Jimmy, in seeing Rose and Fred, was sincere with him that he, as in his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added to his sentence, was simply too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to put an end to everything by letting the police who since then track him down do the work, which he himself did not have the courage to do, for him!
