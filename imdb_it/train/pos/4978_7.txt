A nice short Shirely Temple. The screaming child actors in their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and that hour. Perhaps one had to recover "to be seen and not listened to". Other than that, it's fun. Given the era of movies, there are some aspects of the thing, from the social point of view, that seem to me both very progressive and liberal. I don't want to get into those here, I'd rather not ruin them for you but let you look at yourself and see if you notice those elements. From the beginning it was easy to see from this brief the charm that he was already developing for Temple. It's worth a look if you're a fan of Temple. For others it is a fantastic way to kill ten minutes while you wait for your good night of glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
