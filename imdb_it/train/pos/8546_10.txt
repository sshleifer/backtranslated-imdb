This is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made! Even though I've only seen forty minuets and I have to say this is a good movie. The plot is fun and because there is sex in almost every corner of this movie. It's really fun and I don't see how anyone can NOT like this movie. I really really want to see the rest of the movie. He has a sick scene (believe me, it's not very pleasant) but, apart from that, it's a great movie. I consider this film a 7/8 for the comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. Please if you are a fan of American Pie and want to see a movie where there is virtually all the sex in it buying this movie. You will like it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
