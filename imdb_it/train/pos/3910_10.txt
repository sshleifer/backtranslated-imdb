So I'm at home, browsing the canals one evening, and I run into this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colorful background on HBO. Of course, I did a double turn and decided to watch for a while. I didn't change channels until it was finished, it was incredibly fun. The next time, I made sure to record it so I could see it over and over again, and it remained one of my favorite things to watch. During the first two minutes, you can say that the public is not quite sure what to think, but quickly conquers them with its incredible humor and wit. While many comedians mingle in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events. His show stayed with me later. I went to Italy during the summer, and all I could think of while I was there was how "Italians are always on scooters that go 'HELLO ...'" 10 out of 10. See. You will not regret.
