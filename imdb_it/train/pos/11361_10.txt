Even though I saw this film years ago, its impact never left me. The representation of an intruder by Stephen Rea is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is extraordinary of Sutherland who tries to welcome him and provide the police with ways for the police to coordinate their efforts x. Every day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think of this film and the grueling work that people trying to find killers do.
