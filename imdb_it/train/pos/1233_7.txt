A strange role for Eddie Murphy in the high point of his career. While there is a lot of "Eddie Murphy's character", he plays a really decent person. The rest of the cast is good, especially the beautiful Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of her character kept the tone of the film becoming too Murphy.
