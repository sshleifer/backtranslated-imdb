Most Stoogephiles believe this is the best short bar in Stooges, and they are right. Curly is a drag dress scream like "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in excellent shape respectively as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto". Christine McIntyre's beautiful operatic voice is highlighted - she was actually a trained opera singer - and she is wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is exhilarating as a pompous Italian singer terrified by the Stooges at a company party. Some really funny gags, good direction and very tight editing make this ascent the pinnacle of the Stooges' prolific output. What is even more surprising is that at that time Curly was having serious health problems, and in many of the short films he made during this time, you can see that he is obviously ill; his timing is far away, he speaks very slowly and firmly, and has difficulty moving. Fortunately, his health grew when he made this film, and proves it. Stooge's classic comedy, and also enjoyed by non-Stooge fans (I had a girl who couldn't stand the Stooges, but she also laughed at it). A must see.
