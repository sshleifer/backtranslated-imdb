A film about wannabee's, never-were's and less-than-heroes that make it against all odds. Where did we hear it before? But when the unfortunates are the Shoveller, the Blue Raja and the Mr. Furious, you know this is not your conventional story of rags for wealth. <br /> <br /> A classic performance by Eddie Izzard in the role of Tony P. one of the guys at the disco the leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain show that the real thought went to the casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first sight a strange choice for the role of Captain Amazing proves to be apt. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're sick of a comic-go-movie stereotype. Why can't anger be a superpower?
