The world is a terrible place. But this movie is farce and it's fun. And if you don't like it ... you don't understand ... and if you don't get ... it doesn't matter. It depends on you if you want to play. Every actor in this had fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka doing MY WAY are, as "Vic" says, "... the best version ever". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned not to have seen it, but I'm certainly glad I did ...
