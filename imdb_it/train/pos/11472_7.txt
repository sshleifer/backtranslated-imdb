As a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings, this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two men in difficulty (I cannot refer to people who kill like boys or teenagers), the months of preparation leading to zero days (the code name for the day they will attack) the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun. He seems intent on portraying the pain he suffers, but focuses on literal preparation. The problem is that little in terms of emotions is directly delivered. The only point where the emotion became overwhelming was the end, as expected. But up to this point, it is never really clear why they are planning it. We are told the obligatory story that they have been laughed at, but the film also seems to contradict it. Without ruining the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions, but it is insufficient due to sloppy films. The whole direction is amateur, to promote the concept of home-made video, but history and continuity are weak. The film seems to want the public to decide a lot, but fails to provide information for such an event. The ending is abrupt, and it does not seem that all the film has started to end.
