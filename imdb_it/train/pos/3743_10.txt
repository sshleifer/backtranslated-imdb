Narrow script, good direction, excellent performance, strong cast, effective use of places .... <br /> <br /> Paul McGann offers a detailed and subtle performance as the man at the center of a new murder investigation that could have committed a similar murder before. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moral and emotional journey that takes place with his character (Ben Turner) and intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross ... Who did what? <br /> <br /> The WHY review, both in the past and in the present, rather than the WHO may have produced a more interesting story, Dostoevsky, but hey, who's complaining? <br /> <br />
