This is cult stuff. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I've seen this move dozens of times and haven't enjoyed it yet. The actors are fun and improve with every vision! If you liked "Morons from out of Space" you will love it. A great work on War of the Worlds. I love the fury of the Red-Neck to get the aliens, the bug on the hood, the DOD, the Annyilator Populous Heat Seeking, the Mine Field, the Red Camo, which break the speed limit of 1800 mph! "I'll take the bucket!" Very funny. I'd like it to come out on DVD! Forget the bad reviews to see it for you!
