Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I borrowed books from the school library whenever I received them. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - lots of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the history of Herge and its development of Tintin. The director's personal experience in the Herge interview and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for Chan's character was very moving. <br /> <br /> A great documentary by a very talented and loved artist. A great example of someone who has become internationally famous and has brought joy to millions of children (and young people at heart) around the world.
