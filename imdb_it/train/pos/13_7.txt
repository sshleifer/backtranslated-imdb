The quality of the production, the cast, the premise, the authentic New England setting (Waterbury, CT?) And the lush score of John Williams should have led to a 3-4 star collector. Unfortunately, all we got was a "decent" 2-star passable, mostly memorable for what it tried to do ......... bring a mainstream art house film. The setting of the small town and the history of ordinary people is a genre in its own right, and if done well, it will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda was unable to hide her intelligence enough to make her character credible. I was wondering why he wasn't doing a post-doctoral doctorate at Yale instead of working in a job without an exit in Waterbury. The character of Robert DiNiro was a bit too contrived. An illiterate and likeable loser who turns out to be, with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. <br /> <br /> This genre has been managed most successfully from "Nobody's Fool" "in the mid-90s and this year (2003)" About Schmidt ". I would like the main streaming studios to try more things for teenage post and we reserved a couple of screens for the multi cinema complexes for these efforts. <br /> <br /> I'll give him an "A" for the effort.
