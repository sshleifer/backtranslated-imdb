I also love this movie. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was very busy and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The film's erotic struck viewers and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, the producer and director, was always emphasized by this. In its genre it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or three short films that also worked for the TV before becoming a sort of therapist. <br /> <br /> For people who wish to review that movie, you can find it on its home page which is not so easy to look for but is possible.
