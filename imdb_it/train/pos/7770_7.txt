"Written on the Wind" is a melodrama by Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by the "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder etc. Who hailed him as a master director - I think it's for the refinement of his cinematography - "Written on the Wind" offers images in lush colors and splendid decorations. But I wonder: is this enough to bring a movie? The acting in "Written on the Wind" goes from weak to loyal (except Robert Stack - he is as convincing as the weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, normally a powerful presence on the screen, is uncomfortable in this film. Dorothy Malone as the seductress, the "femme fatale" without worries is OK, but she lacks strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but silly. <br /> <br /> The plot has some very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A rigid patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by his disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and nympho daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of princes, a former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought together to Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, brawls, laughter, death, etc. - well, when I read the story summary on the back of the DVD I thought I was expecting a deal. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Written on the Wind" takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, acting in general is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors only do an efficient job. I think that perhaps with Italian or Spanish actors these scenes would have been explored in depth - they would end up (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What remains for us is the beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk. For me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
