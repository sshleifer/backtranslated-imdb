Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a mocking comedy at the same time. The result is irregular, but generally amusing. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character fairly well. Wantabedde is even better. A word of warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is a rather nice time capsule.
