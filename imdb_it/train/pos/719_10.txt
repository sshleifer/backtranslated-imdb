Although this film is at its best, it's perfect. This film, no doubt, must be considered a modern classic. There are basically two types of films I like - movies with depth (chick films, if you have to - blame my wife for that) and mindless comedies where I can sit and relax. This film is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine introduced me to this film shortly after its release. Considering me a bit superficial, he told me: "You have to see this movie, it's just your kind of movie". By suppressing the insult, I started looking. I know they mentioned the Ramones a million times, but when you see them, I said, "Hey, it's the Ramones." My friend replied: "I don't know they were a real band". I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This film, although now a little dated, is a must see for Ramones fans - or anyone else.
