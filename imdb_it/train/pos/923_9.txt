I never saw it on TV, but I rented the DVD via Netflix as soon as I found out it was available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's fun and the entertainment is excellent. This level of quality I would have expected only from the movies, so I am surprised by some of the negative comments about it. Did the DVD version improve the animation? A bonus on the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I am an adult and I really appreciate the fact that it is for adults. It's not just children who like cute animated characters. It's not even remotely "vulgar" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it. I am very disappointed that it has been canceled. I wish they would have produced more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
