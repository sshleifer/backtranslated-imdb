Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas that are addressed. Humanity has made a series of technological advances, but is humanity mature enough to face its new toys? There is moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to attract attention. I predict (based on BSG's background) that there will be a problem with Cylon and slavery. In addition to this, there are all the other problems we humans do. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least not as much as humanity is fleeing a ruthless problem that was at the end of themselves. There aren't many special shooter or space effects - at least not in the first few episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> What he has are very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performance by the actors. They can create a culture that is similar to modern society, but at the same time alien to be completely credible. As a BSG, this show is about humanity: our strengths, weaknesses, potential and flaws. It may seem a bit strange that a human society on a different set of worlds has ties, vintage cars and chicken. But those things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone who gets stuck on those details just hasn't understood the point. Whether you are a Mafia-style culture or a rich, high-tech culture, humans and human nature are not so different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see today in the world. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
