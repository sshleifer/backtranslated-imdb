I liked this movie, nice and funny. I found this film a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this film was when it referred to the New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Sorry to tell the Yankee fans. I recommend this photo for the whole family. Of course with your typical love / comedy movie, there is a long moment in the film, I fell in love with it and what I do, but the film compensates with all the slapstick moments. The film shows some moments of how the Red nation Sox (in Fenway Park) as the fans have heard that about 86 years of Sox have always failed at the end of the season and how love for Sox and love with another human go hand in hand.
