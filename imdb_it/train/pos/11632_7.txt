Greetings still from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is really thrilling! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen time in this cute little classic thriller by the famous horror director Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street"). Craven also has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this work work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes when we see that McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people on the phone. She is natural. When he meets Cillian Murphy (the Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what appears to have happened, the film really takes flight. Watching the two types of yuppies flirt while the audience knows something evil is happening, it's a charmer movie! The sequence of flat glides is mesmerizing and the over 30 minutes on board are excruciatingly claustrophobic. Craven induces us to guess the involvement of others and if someone will come to his rescue. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only disappointment occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe that little Rachel has the necessary pent-up anger to see this, but we can't help but shiver a little. The most exaggerated scenes involve angry guests, an annoying passenger of the airline, Cillian's injury and the FX in the hotel. The strength of the film lies in the development of the character and in the psychological games among the protagonists. Unfortunately the veteran of the big screen Brian Cox is underutilized, but overall this is an above-average suspense that is worth seeing for everyone except the finale.
