Created in 1946 and published in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the great films made by Welles after returning from relative exile for having created Citizen Kane. Dark, brooding and an expression of the paranoia of the first cold war, this film is as high as a film-crime film by Film-Noir. The cinematography of this film is full of the characteristic features of Welles of strange angles, rapid cuts, long pans and sinister lights. The use of ambient street music is a precursor of the incredible opening strike in Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and the Chinatown sequences can be considered the inspiration, in many ways, to Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it is Welles' obsession with technical cinema that hurts this film in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible confusion of cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, the story combined with the wonderful performances of Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make this film a joy to watch. Orson Welles brings out not only the Irish brogue, but the identities torn like the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who at the time was married to Welles, breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of true depth and contradiction. Finally, the strange and bizarre portrait of Glenn Anders or Elsa's lawyer companion is nothing short of classic!
