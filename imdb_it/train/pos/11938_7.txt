I like movies like this for their spirit, no pun. It's a decent and clean film about a baseball team that is falling behind, and a young fan wants them to win, since his dead dad said it was the only way he would come back for him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a fun cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the heavenly Al, taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It is an energetic film. It makes you smile and really involves you in sports. <br /> <br /> Here is my complaint. the only thing that bothers me is these sports movies that turn you into an unexpected fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I find it strange that I should leave the film thinking that the Angels are a strong and strong team, when in reality my basic loyalty, as it is, is found in the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about a team of losing kids, that's fine.
