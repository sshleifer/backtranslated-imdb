A boy with ideals who tries to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and that is violating the rights of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up and tells the truth. A family that is falling apart and fighting against it. A movie you can't hide from. See things, and feel things, and feel things, that until the day you die, hope would never have happened for real. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can't do anything, and a boy with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who won't accept things, who won't let anything happen, a child with power, and a kid who he acts like a professional, as if he had never done anything else, he finally brings this film and anyone who wants to see how the abuses found their place in the 1960s.
