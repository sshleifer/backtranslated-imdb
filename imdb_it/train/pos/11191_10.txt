This frightening and rather bloody adaptation of the great Stephen King novel presents extraordinary central interpretations of Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some very awkward macabre effects. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style, and manages to make this one of the few versions of King's work that is not only worthy of being seen, but really unnerving. The depiction of the zombie child Gage (Miko Hughes - later in "New Nightmare") is equally noteworthy, as what could easily have been a ridiculous character is rendered threatening and spooky. As for the people, who think that this is not scary - watch it alone in the dark (possibly with your picky girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will creep you out. Some horror movies like this or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "should not be looked at in a group. Recommended for horror fans!
