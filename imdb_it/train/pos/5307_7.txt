"Pecker" is a young unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star of the public, media and local art scene with his photos showing the dirty reality of everyday life like dirty underwear or human excrement. It is a typical topic of John Waters' independent comedies in Baltimore to show the strange sides of the American lifestyle between political correctness and conservative setbacks by exploring the backgrounds of the bourgeois society of his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" celebrates Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and longtime Mink actress Stole. Although the rhythm of the plot becomes a major flaw sometimes and cannot compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water's brilliant "Serial Mom", there are still some good laughs and some unforgettable scenes like an ex-addict who he became a vegetarian sniffing peas from a vegetable ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media mortgages, the anguish of the bourgeoisie and the strange ways of becoming a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
