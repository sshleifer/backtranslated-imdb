Otto Preminger's film cycle, Dana Andrews, is among the (largely) unsung jewels of the genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may have seemed out of place at the time, but the clear images, the complex game with identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological principles, the austere, geometric style all seem surprisingly modern today and very similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so loaded, brutal and ironic that the "happy" ending is one of the crudest in Hollywood history. Brilliant even on the level of the amusing thriller, tense and full of double-edged dialogues.
