Tom had a desire to make films for a long time and he did. it is as if he had seen a dirty and worn-out notebook full of small and big ideas that he filled and carried for 10 years. no transformation of concession character, no Hollywood ingredient just life and some magic. balance, in speed, in the strangeness of comedy against drama is perfectly balanced. this film takes you on a journey that ended before you realized how beautiful it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this film is not about anything, simply a sequence of sketches of people who are mainly connected through a party of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly fun, it's brilliant because it's empty. between the lines it is happening. see or not see, this is the?
