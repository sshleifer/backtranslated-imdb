The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continually interested in flashbacks up until childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, you simply can't go wrong. The plot itself, the true story and the essence of the film, is fun. It's the kind of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do a lot and, in this case, he really did a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end you have to anticipate more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity behind this story is first class. I felt like this movie had been exquisitely done from beginning to end, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without boring pauses - the action flowed neatly, quickly and firmly from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Demonstrates how far people can go: so they do horrible things to their loved ones, and do such evil deeds, in the name of "God" when they are disillusioned as in this case. Sometimes it is also interesting in its "inclinations" and takes the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the kind of film that is easily overlooked, but I would advise you not to do it the same way and to control this film - it's really worth it.
