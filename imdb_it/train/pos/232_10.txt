What a delightful movie. The characters were not only lively but alive, reflecting everyday life and conflict within a family. Each character has brought a unique personality to the story that the public could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends. <br /> <br /> The plot has a realistic flow that the viewer can assimilate and be part of the drama, laughter and tears as the film's plot develops. The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reactions of the characters to conflict, opinion and resolution. <br /> <br /> It's not an epic movie, but it's a very nice movie to watch with loved ones. A lot of head whims and "ahhh" moments to share and entertain.
