This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He doesn't want them, but reluctantly lets them in. He seems to be studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize this is a family movie but - College of Witchcraft ??? Come ON !!) Before the course can finish even if the college is closed because of the war (???) and she tries the head Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the children travel on a bed with the help of a thin bed. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time when I was 9 and I vaguely remember loving it. Certainly does not hold up as an adult! The story is stupid (even for a fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly hateful. Roddy McDowall is also third classified and appears only in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Naboombu Island, which is run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun but the animation is scarce (for Disney) and has a very violent and too long football match between the animals. Here are some fantastic graces: Lansbury and Tomlinson are simply fantastic; the songs (even if forgotten) are pleasant; the long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the Oscar-winning special effects are still pretty impressive in the end. But the weak plot, the poor animation and the unlikely children have really taken away this story. I heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give a 7.
