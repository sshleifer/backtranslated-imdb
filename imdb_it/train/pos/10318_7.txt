He claimed that The Movies and Baseball thrived during the Great Depression. It seems that the sad realities of a nation reached after the economic disaster have created a need for occasional relief for the population. A temporary escape could be found in the current soap opera that is Baseball. <br /> <br /> Similarly, an occasional 2 or 3 hour excursion in the dark auditoriums of the Cinema. The presence of a radio in almost everyone's home held the Depression Era America immediately in tune with the events of the world and provided many dramas and (above all) comedies for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality. <br /> of the time flourished at all levels. Youthful reading habits have helped create the comic book as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the comic does not appear magically, completely developed with all the colored 4 color pages, all by itself. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. Obviously, the Newspaper Comic Strip was a parent, providing the visual / narrative method of the story. <br /> <br /> The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine. The inexpensive publications of the prose story that carried a great deal of stories from the same adventure characters, though not necessarily serialized, stories. The pasta medium had been around for a few decades and presented Edgar Rice Borrough TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's ZORRO. The '30s carried out an exceptional harvest as characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8 BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER, UOM MASTER all made their way to the newsstands, among others. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, a thoroughbred superhero of written history; the pulp covers perhaps had the only "image" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super acute senses and a genius and proteiform class intellect, Doc was the prototype of the Superhero. <br /> <br /> He also brought together 5 of his former army friends into a small team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a particular field. So we had a higher score: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 1940s and were published in the mid-1950s. Then they went on break for 12-15 years. Then the flash of genius came to repackage the old novels in the new "container", the pocket book. A new look for the cover was introduced, with a series of very stylized paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually torn shirt. <br /> <br /> The re-introduction proved to be very successful, with the publication of a title per month (and for a little more). Soon, there was a voice from a Doc Savage movie! But when, from which manufacturer? Well, the revered "Man of Bronze" has been back on the newsstands for over 10 years before a real project was put together. He was a veteran of Stop-action Animator and producer of the best special effects films, Geoprge Pal, who shot the film together with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, he boasted of a well-formed team of actors, albeit largely a "No Name" as familiar with the spectators. With the former TV Tarzan, Ron Ely's almost perfect casting in the lead, coming and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran Paul Wexler (like the villain, Capitan Seas); no other name would have been recognized. And, perhaps, this was an advantage in this case. <br /> <br /> History is a great job both to let the public know most of the public and the incredible group and at the same time get a plot. The use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short films are the method pursued to move the introduction along the main body of the story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, there are suggestions that this story will go with the same kind of "Camp" humor produced by the TV series Batman. Some high-impact initial scenes involving Doc and the entire crew doing their individual specialties are thrown into humor by Paul Frees' narrative and unexpected, unlikely results. (For example, a Doc experiment with a miniature missile / missile appears to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one in that case.) The whole story takes place this way, striking the viewer with a small " Camp "every so often, to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. We are also perplexed that Mr. George Pal is the producer (his last). He who had been so famous for special effects, certainly a factor that could be used in a context of science fiction action in the world of Pulp Character. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it very vividly. Ms. Ryan (Deanna) was in the hospital, having just given birth to our second daughter, Michelle (08/14/75). Our oldest girl, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after visiting hours ended up in the maternity ward, she was headed to the old Marquette theater, 63 and Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was a little disappointed with the final product. I could accept a bit of this 'Camp' business, but I wouldn't have opposed it if MrPal had thought of letting everything pass and having real Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give him a little more Pulp / Comic / Emotion of a serial type . <br /> <br /> Still, the cast, directed by Mr. Ely and others, made the whole movie nice, if not lovable. The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very similar to those of a series or adventure movie from the 1930s that would be fun for anyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what they were looking for with this DOC SAVAGE, BRONZE MAN.
