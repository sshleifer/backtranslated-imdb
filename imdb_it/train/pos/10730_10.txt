Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at the same time as Challenger Explosion. That really put a stop to when it was released or even if it did, take it out. I'm glad I did it. I saw SpaceCamp for the first time in a drive-in movie. Which has greatly improved the vision. <br /> <br /> While I had heard of Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of others in the film. So, it was a big shock for me to find all those young people who played and performed really well! Obviously Kate Capshaw was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the scenes, in which those children were shown how to behave as a team. The children's scenes were prepared for a trip that they could only hope for. The real launch of a spacecraft, of course, is new to us. However, this was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most popular films. Escapist maybe, but it was great for a fool like me. After probably hiring for 30 - 40 times. Eventually I found it available in a certain store and bought it. Now, if it only comes out on DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.
