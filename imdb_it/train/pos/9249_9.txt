This film is witty, watchable and touching. And now do you often see Jean Harlow (or any actress of this age, so to speak) give another woman a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow's Ruby was sent to a reformatory after being confused with Edward Hall of Gable (he of that crooked but engaging and captivating smile), his situation becomes even more complicated when she finds out she is pregnant, and is convinced that this rake has abandoned her, but in reality her love has reformed him and comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested and, with the help of a minister, will be married . <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with his fellow prisoners is second only to his electric chemistry with Gable, who was his most frequent guide man. His cynical character goes perfectly with the con man of Gable. What's wrong? <br /> <br /> "You know, you wouldn't be a bad-looking lady - if it weren't for your face!" Ruby brusquely points out her rival Gypsy. "If you're going to get close to me, I'll have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
