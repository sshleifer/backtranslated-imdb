Spend most of this two-hour movie asking yourself "what's the main character's story?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as a low-key "Ben Thomas", will keep you right. The last 20-25 minutes is when you discover it, and it's a real shock ... but you knew something dramatic would be revealed. Until then, Smith interprets the mysterious people, almost stalking. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it's never really been explained, again, to make us guess until the end. <br /> <br /> Everything, including an on / off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") could make some viewers frustrated or eager to leave this movie ..... but not because last long segment brings together all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film and not the typical Will Smith action film. In fact, the most shocking aspect could be to see Smith's drawn and sad face in this whole story. He almost doesn't look like himself in a number of shots. He seems to have lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job playing a man who brings a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> As a good movie will do it often, this movie will leave you thinking long after the credits.
