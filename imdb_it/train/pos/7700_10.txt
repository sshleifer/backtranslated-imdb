this was one of those 50-cent yore deals --- and much more complex than many realized --- and it was in color! not only the effects are extraordinary, against disgust as 'the land against flying saucers' --- the real 'killer' is the 'universality of the plot' --- it all depends on two principles --- the ancient concept of a desire of the hidden and incestuous father to think of his daughter, and the idea of ​​what would happen if the technology of a world reached the point where the desires of all citizens manifested themselves. <br /> <br /> Needless to say if all those we wish to die become dead, not many, if they are left - and this has become the fate of the population of the "forbidden" planet, actually quite modern. unfortunately the "march" of "The Krell" --- wasted by ignorance, remains, and "Morpheus", the incestuous father, knows how to access this technology - and does so, to avoid losing another's daughter. ancient plot, beautifully rendered. <br /> <br /> and considering his age, it remains a suspense, action, a classic of human emotions --- and visually very modern --- don't pass this - - Presents all modern science fiction --- and the its psychological content elevates it, beyond any genre - a timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and the soundtract! you will see / you will not feel pure 'synth' and perfectly syched Moog background --- to 'not miss' ---
