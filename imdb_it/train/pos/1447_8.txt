I read the negative comments before seeing this movie and without getting discouraged, I went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind several times because the film is incredibly complex, involved and full of details. This is a positive thing, but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, free sex and general violence that replace the character's plot and development. In fact, as a welcome start, however, I am so used to not paying much attention to what I look at. <br /> <br /> This film is full of character development and plot; the kind we used to analyze when I was in high school. It requires a real mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it to "All the President's Men" in terms of generic topics. That is, it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those who have enough influence over officials to essentially "own" them. <br /> <br /> Unlike "All The President's Men", this film strives to give two characters the true personality. In this sense the film is a study of characters like "The Negotiatior" with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that film, their characters are both employed in the city and the plot is extremely intense. However, the plot depends on their characters' ability to cooperate with each other, trust each other, and eventually join together against the corrupt police department. There is more gunfire in this film and the specific plot is different, but in general, there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that City Hall requires much more concentration. In fact, it struck me how parallel the past and present political scandals were that I saw in my life returning to Watergate. The fact is that the public knows that something is wrong, of course! but following the details is hard to do. This film is not even close to being as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic for life in its complexity. I think that's one of the reasons why the previous posters criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If you look at this know what they are going to see and are up to the experience, it's really excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is superb and the direction is impeccable. The weakest link is the accent of John Cusak.
