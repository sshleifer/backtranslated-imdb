Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", I cried at the end (many times) and I am a boy of about 60. I also wondered why this great film, which has won so many awards and has been applauded by so many critics, has only received a rating of 7.0 from imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I have observed the breakdown of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave a vote of 10, 10.7% gave it a vote. 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, reduced the overall rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting model (a sudden 1 rating increase, with a high rating of 10, decreasing only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping to level 1) just one thing: hate for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I tuned myself into enough chat rooms to see the jokes of young people (especially young people), who slandered them left and right. They absolutely hate the man and will have no role in giving him any credit in "Titanic". (To answer another user: I am NOT talking about someone who doesn't like the movie very much, and has given a 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has, and has the right to taste. But no one can convince me that the imdb's rating of only 7.0 ever for "Titanic", pulled to that level by an excessive number of ridiculous assessments, is a fair reflection of the overall film.) <br /> <br /> Let me prove my point by comparing the voting model of imdb users of "Titanic" in 5 randomly selected box offices and critical "bombs" (there are many others, but these 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled out of theaters after a bad box office showing, and the ratings of imdb voters were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 rating (overall rating of 6.1 ). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received 4.3% of votes 10 and 9.9% of votes 1 (overall rating of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% of votes 10 and 2.6% of votes 1 (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 rating (overall rating of 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% of votes 10 and 3.7% of votes 1 (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT ARE ALL THESE FILMS WITH "TITANIC" COMMON? ALL THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 ASSESSMENTS ARE LOWER !!!! OF "TITANIC", AND NONE OF THESE PANDIDS HAVE NEVER BEEN APPOINTED FOR A SINGLE PRIZE. Once again, "Titanic" got 10.7% of the votes! Compare it with the other 5 films I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be other explanations besides hatred of the Leo factor? <br /> <br />
