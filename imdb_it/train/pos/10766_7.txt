A subtle story with many fine strokes. Eyecatchers here are the three women of D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the boy who accompanies them. Traci Lords convincingly stages the female half of a wicked business couple who intends to poison the world with antrax. Original in this film is the bra bomb, put on a captured member of the D.R.E.A.M. Obviously it is saved by a co-member, three seconds before the explosion. Although it is clearly lent by James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "You only live two twice", such a climax always works well. All in all a nice watch, James Bond replaced here by three Charlie's Angels.
