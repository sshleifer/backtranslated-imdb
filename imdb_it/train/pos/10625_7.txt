"Hatred of a Minute" is probably one of the best films released by Michigan in recent years. Not to mention that it's a brilliant film anyway, but it's definitely worth being a watch. <br /> <br /> "Hatred" tells the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a previously abused child now raised up, and starting to listen to his evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very beautiful visually. The shots are creative and the lighting is appropriately moody and interesting to watch. This film actually has an element of production value, unlike other recent Michigan titles like "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". The subtle Dolly shots and the composition of stylized shots show good use of this film's $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> However, "Hatred" stumbles into the same places that many other local films do, and this is in the story and character department. In essence, things are just kind. Eric Seaver does not evolve at all. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. The film turns to its happy path with minimal development. Furthermore, the finish is very abrupt. <br /> <br /> However, since this is a horror movie, since when do we care about the plot? We just want to see people die, and "Hatred" certainly offers. As the body's bill went up, the people in the theater began to applaud "Kill it! Kill it all!" When people scream on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is the place where "hatred" succeeds. It is funny. And in the end, that's all that really matters.
