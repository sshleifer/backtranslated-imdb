Wang Bianlian is an old street artist who is known as a "King of masks" for his mastery of the Sichuan art of change. Liang is a famous lyric opera of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is concerned that a precious art should not die with Wang and therefore sows the seed of an heir in Wang's mind. The film is about prejudice, male domination, state of the art, values ​​and, above all, warmth. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. The whole film is in a loop. Everything has meaning. It is a long story that has been modified so well that the duration of the film is only 91 minutes. Total satisfaction. For five minutes is an artistic film, the next five minutes is a sad film, the next five minutes is a thriller. Only his mood changes as if his protagonist were changing his face. The last scene on the string is phenomenal. The story and the script are impeccable. The actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists that you can tell how they performed. Very impressive. He was not even nominated for an Oscar. That year 'English patient' got the best film Oscar and in the category of foreign films 'Kolya' won. "Kolya" was OK and spoke of "English patient", the younger said, better it was. Watch it 9/10.
