After his Oscar nomination in "Secrets & Lies", Brenda Blethyn starred in the excellent "Saving Grace". And let me tell you, this is not the kind of movie you find every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband committed suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a huge debt. Fortunately, find a way to make ends meet: marijuana. True, Grace starts to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this film has been reproduced with great effect; there is no boring moment anywhere in it. And I certainly didn't see that final scene coming! But anyway, you have to see this movie. You may feel more than a little party after seeing it. If nothing else, it could work as a good lesson on getting to know your finances. But of course, there is much more!
