It has been so long since I saw this film (at least 15 years) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <br /> A unit of Australian underwater demolition experts is captured in an archipelago near Japan after a mission to establish mines in a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other prisoner of war but to their dismay they soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they have been tried as spies since they were out of the uniform when caught. The consequences of such an infringement, by the Japanese martial code, are execution by beheading. <br /> <br /> Despite their requests, and the requests of the friendly prison guard, the day of reckoning is approaching like a time bomb. The tension is so high that you will actually hear the ticking, even if it could just be your chest beating with the percussion of a running execution team. <br /> <br /> The ending is really too painful to get back in my head much less write it here But I can promise you ... you'll never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the United States
