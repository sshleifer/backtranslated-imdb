Because the previews are so blah for such a fantastic movie !! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and fun from the first moment, original and well acted. I wish the film was acting like a good press it deserves! <br /> <br /> For all those who have loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth and other really fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the biggest. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible protagonist. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is taking a big leap with her recent screen returns. There are also many wonderful moments from minor characters ... even down to facial expressions.
