We saw it at one of the local art cinemas in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, Texas. It was a total surprise compared to the review in the theater newsletter, but we were both impressed by the art. It was well done and (apparently) photographed in a schloss (German castle name) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relations of a group of men and women in their twenties isolated from everyday constraints. It's fantastic on more levels than I can remember. We returned home after the movie and talked and talked until 4 am the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mainly) so there must be at least two versions from the first film reviewer in (probably its original version) German. I searched and searched for a videotape version but I never found anything. I would absolutely like to have a VHS or DVD version of this. Explore relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince them to release it again, preferably on DVD these days. I can't even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties. Please, please bring it back
