This film could have been a silent film; certainly has the feeling of one. I was extremely, extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase, is a "symphony of love" and transcends all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr illuminates the screen, in this film that, in a sense, is almost like a sexual fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic. The technological qualities could have been a bit coarse; but this takes nothing away from the magical enchantment that this film exudes. Many lovers of ancient cinema will love this film.
