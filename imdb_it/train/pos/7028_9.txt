I saw this as a previous spectator by chance, I saw it twice. I liked it very much, no stupid messages that caused messages, but just good fun, good songs, good characters and a simply good movie. Recommended for those of us who love watching movies and not analyzing them. Fun for the whole family. Here. I didn't realize that Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sensual. Songs like One Boy and One last Kiss are really fun to listen to and to touch with Jason Alexander is the complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley was etched in my mind by Cagney and Lacey and her voice and accent still had that memory. Overall, I loved it and will try to buy it if available
