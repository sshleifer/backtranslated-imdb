Although this show has not been on the air since 1973, after seeing a set of DVDs borrowed in our library, I felt compelled to say a little. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a small "Sunday Night Party" with friends to watch this on NBC on one of the few TVs at colors. <br /> <br /> I really like the story not so much for the names and dates, but how it affects us today and how deep it can be based on the most insignificant actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world due to silver, took its name from a character called "Old Virginny", who, in the early days of the city, stumbled into a saloon, fell and broke his bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> The old Virginny didn't want to waste the opportunity like this, while the precious liquid infiltrated the mud, she decided to christen the city "Virginia Town". The area became known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had a reputation for trying to assert everyone's claims and the area became known as the praise comstock. <br /> <br /> I have just seen an episode ahead of time with these 2 subjects. Other episodes concerned the literary rise of Mark Twain while he was a journalist for the Territorial Enterprise ... <br /> <br /> It was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else has said, each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right - rich scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that twisted was the proximity to Virginia City and the Ponderosa. In truth, to go from the Ponderosa (all Northern Lake Tahoe), one would have to ride his horse for about 1,000 feet (1,000 meters) along the Spooner Peak to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley then another 30-40 miles to Virginia city. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the Cartwrights would have some damaged ends that do it regularly. But every writer should have a margin of discretion with the truth. <br /> <br /> How much I miss the show, even today.
