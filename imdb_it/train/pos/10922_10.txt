When I was very young, at a local television station, they gave Saturdays to kung fu movies of all kinds. I've seen many Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remember many of them. I've seen such great films as Crippled Masters, Bruce's Blind Fist, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Master's Rage, Tattoe Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Venoms. I clearly remember the day. My father and father had just had lunch at Burger King. We were running home to see which movie would be Saturday. We ran at home and jumped on the couch, turned on the set and snapped it on 56. The usual intro of many kung fu movies in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday on it So underneath was the title of the film. Said Five Deadly Venoms. Then the film started. I put my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence. I love this movie the moment it arrived. My favorite character was the Toad Venom. The plot was hard to follow at that age but it wasn't what attracted me ... it was the fights. The fights were like this ... I complained every time a commercial arrived and the 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen are over.
