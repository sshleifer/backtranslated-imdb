Different narrative lines are woven around different female characters here. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their problematic lives. All are transformed at the end of the film. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; His daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is retarded and has a limited life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) lost her husband and now raises her children from her deceased ex-wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a bored rich lady. <br /> <br /> Other characters are used to connect the five main female characters. In storytelling, not everything is given at the beginning: some connections are surprisingly late in the film and this adds to the experience. The theme of the shoe is pushed to the extreme: for example, when Leire works as a shoe designer and works in a shoe store where he steals his shoes, he breaks one of his heels. <br /> <br /> In editing small connections are made between the scenes. A phone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. They are used to make the connection and fast cuts. The frequent change of plot prevents being boring or reaching TV levels. It is strongly music-driven to set tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as a backdrop for the stories and the shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters. One of the most moving shots is when Anita, who takes the same walk every day, widens her walk and reduces life from the relative calm of her road to the busy main road: how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done. As in most Spanish films, the narrative is made visually, using soap stories as a simple background. There is a poetic ending that is somehow romantic and sentimental, but it's still beautiful. <br /> <br /> Because Ramón Salazar is too in love with his own material, it is too long. Some scenes are kitschy and to the level of soap, including acting (the love life of Adela, Isabel's doctor). The theme of the shoe is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is technically more competent, but somewhat mechanical. This has more the ability to visually translate emotions and atmosphere. After seeing this, you are inclined to move immediately to the new city of cinema: Madrid.
