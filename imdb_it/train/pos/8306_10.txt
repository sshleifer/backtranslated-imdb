In reality they could not have chosen a more diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon. Capture Little Richard to a more credible essence. The outfits are wonderful and anyone watching this film will surely have a smile on their face through the whole movie. Although the film is a bit long, it keeps your attention with Little Richard's personality and outfits in mind. The ending should have taken the direction of moving Little Richard more into the present, where it could be seen as he aged in this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll for me, regardless of what other media say.
