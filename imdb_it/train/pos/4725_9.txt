Despite the lack of logic in the plot, Kill Shot is a very funny film. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly interprets the emotional rift between a rich and industrious father and his misguided son. Each supporting cast member performs with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid recitation of an Asian young man whose name I don't remember. A tremendously tragic ending could upset some younger spectators, but overall Kill Shot really does offer a death blow.
