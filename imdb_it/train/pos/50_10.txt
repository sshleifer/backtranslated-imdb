My kids just stopped by this movie the other night and when things started playing it really tickled my interest. I had to go play bowling league, so I recorded it for myself on the DVR, so I could see the rest later. Well, I just finished watching it and the front of my shirt must be soup after crying the buckets. It was an excellent film, although I could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing. And in a million years I never imagined why Alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an antisocial goth. That was probably why my shirt was soaked because I felt the same pain that Alissia felt. I wouldn't have tried this movie either, but I'm glad I saw it. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love good drama or tear-jerks.
