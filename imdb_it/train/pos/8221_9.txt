Sudden Impact is the fourth of Dirty Harry's films and one of the best features of these films is that they don't really degrade quality from one movie to another. Thus, Sudden Impact offers another thrill through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry tries to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harry always seems to be at work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry while playing all his men of action, slow, deliberate and fearless. Like the first of Dirty Harry's films made in the 1980s, Sudden Impact lacks a bit of a '70s atmosphere that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that the quality is less. Bottom Line: Rich in intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.
