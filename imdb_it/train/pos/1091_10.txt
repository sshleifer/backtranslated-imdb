I loved this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 20 (which was only four years ago) and I liked it so much, I brought my copy the next day. Comedy is well interpreted by all those involved. I always have to rewind and watch the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for Jason Robards' father who plays Mr. Retch. The talent ran in that family.
