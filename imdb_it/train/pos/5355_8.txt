Running Man brutally illuminates the complex of modern American media and hits its target deadlock. It could be an easy goal, but take it off anyway. RM requires no effort on pro-wrestling (with some professional wrestlers like the Hunters), on the television network, on the Nielsen rankings, on the American government (suggesting, however, to be fun-oriented), crime and punishment, and half a dozen other things along the road . It is very different from Stephen King's original novel, and Arnold is not even the Ben Richards of the novel. But who cares? Basically it's a Arnie film, with all the action sequences and well-choreographed choreography that requires a business.
