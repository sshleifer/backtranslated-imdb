This movie was a lot of fun, although you will only like it if: - you would hate going to the dentist but you are not afraid of a movie where one of them becomes superfluous - you love horror movies <br /> <br /> I is particularly liked the fact that some care was given in explaining the brutal actions of the main character. The fact that he is totally obsessed with cleaning (especially in the mouth) and then takes his wives by offering a little oral pleasure to the mud-covered pond is a reason enough to exaggerate. <br /> <br /> I liked it. I give him an 8.
