Obsession <br /> <br /> The debut film by Luchino Visconti, this Italian noir is generally credited for the launch of the neorealist movement - well, he says it right on the back of the box - and it is a portrait sometimes penetrating, to times lugubrious people in a moral flow. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of secondary characters - including a naive tramp who embraces the communist virtues - embodies the remote desperations of a country that seeks its identity from the outside, adrift of ghosts who desire a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the disinherited and his ability to express their deplorable conditions was already well developed, the web of deceptions is tenuous - although one point of the noir is to put a protagonist manipulated by destiny and the femme fatale, Gino is so upset here to begin that he fears he deserves it - the too didactic cosmic irony, the illicit relationship with bathos. However, it is incisive and essential, even if its real impact on the history of cinema is certainly questionable.
