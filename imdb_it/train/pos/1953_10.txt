Since this film was based on a true story about a woman who had two children and wasn't very wealthy, it was just as scary as it was real! Acting is what gave the film the drive for greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton played the main character, Patsy McCartle, who had two children she loved. His performance is what made the true story of life come to life on a television screen. It has been very difficult to watch some scenes since they were so real about what happens when you become addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring was difficult, but so true. I met people who have retired and it was very similar to what happened in this film, from what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to make a film about what happened to this woman. Yet it has been done so well. I congratulate the director for making this film. I highly recommend it to everyone who has known someone who has always been addicted to drugs or simply to know what can happen to you if you become dependent on them.
