This film really opened its eyes. I've seen this movie several times. Before, when I was four and actually remembered it and when I was 12 years old. The whole message that the director is transmitting is that everyone wakes up and doesn't make the mistake of leaving God out of everyday life or simply going an extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for unbelievers and believers alike!
