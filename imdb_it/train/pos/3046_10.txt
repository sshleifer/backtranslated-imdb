All good movies "inspire" some movies directed at copied videos. I was afraid that "The Gladiator" was not such a beautiful film, because I had not seen any film that had anything remotely similar to Roman's on the shelf for new releases for months. Then I saw the last offer of Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of the Full Moon Puppetmaster series and Blood Dolls, but I've never seen one of their non-killer puppet movies. However ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus tells what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artefacts and feels compelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it. He becomes possessed and, like the diabolical gladiator Tyrant, is forced to kill his friends to revive the corpse, which is the real Tyrant. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many Full Moon movies, this one has little or no budget. Sometimes the editing and direction were so amateurish that I could swear I was looking at the Blair Witch Project. Attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of a Monty Python skit. The weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic. It seems literally that it was shot by a group of friends with a digital video camera on a weekend. Of course, there's nothing wrong with this type of film production, but don't rent it expecting a technical masterpiece. It seems that there have also been attempts to search for the script, because, although Tyrannus does not really behave much like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> I actually liked this movie. Not as much as a killer puppet movie, maybe, but Full Moon still gives away! The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of Full Moon Videozone in the end!
