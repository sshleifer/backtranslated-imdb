Listening to the soundtrack right now, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye (to be able to type it) very strong. I've seen it twice so far, and I should be ashamed to have seen it * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except perhaps for Nausicaa who was, even in the untrimmed version, too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). However, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to become too naive / positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuances, a bit too explicit / moralistic (Mononoke). At least, compared to the other master Ghibli Takahata (Tomb of the Fireflies / Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this. <br /> <br /> To Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant story that storytellers have collected and perfected over the centuries, combined with a little bit of morality, but well interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and fun of Totoro for example. Every single main character is portrayed perfectly with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The rhythm is so perfect that I know nothing but a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational attraction on your whole being. The plot looks like an action movie with mentioned mysteries, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme is inserted, you have a vision of the great mystery you are about to discover, but the story then settles and gradually, on a number of carefully selected serene action and beauty scenes, builds an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty, after days of gloomy darkness, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing that the path walked, seeing the distance to travel, but smiling just to see it. <br /> <br /> It is so similar to a white light that explodes in your skull that if you keep your eyes dry and your mind numb from when the headlines start spinning, you should see a therapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that technically, in images, some more recent Miyazaki could be more overwhelming, for me this remains his undisputed masterpiece. If it takes a fraction of a second to realize that this was done in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This, of course, was suggested earlier, but for me this is his only film that can, by itself, completely illustrate this simple fact. If you lose this during your life, you will die with a huge void - which would be a shame, since the coffin costs the same.
