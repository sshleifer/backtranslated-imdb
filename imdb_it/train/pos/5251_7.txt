Well, "Wayne's World" has long since disappeared and the years since then have been difficult to film. from a similar film offal like "It's Pat" to the recent 80-minute yawn, "A night at the Roxbury", many have, without doubt, lost the confidence that any other snln skit will ever be able to move to the big screen. Well, don't worry because Tim Meadows runs in spades. the well written plot maintains the public's interest until the end and while remaining faithful to the character of Leon Phelps introduced in the five-minute skit, the plot allows the character to develop. the humor (which consists largely of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh more than I ever did in a recent memory film. it's a great time if you don't feel like taking yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of the "Saved by the Bell" fame, makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally Billy Dee Williams, reliving the 45 days of his Colt, gives the film a touch of class. and for those out there who are mindless movie quotes like me, you'll find this movie to be eminently citable, "ooh, it's a lady!"
