... of this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together in a movie? This film begins with a touch of Brazil ... when, at a certain point, the story moves directly into the twilight zone ... with nothing new, but nothing at all ... and nothing is very funny! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie gets really fun ... bouncing heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> however ... this film was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> <br /> Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali has given this a minimalist, strange but very special design, which makes it difficult to identify the place of history or its time ... timeless in some way ...
