The thief of Baghdad is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although the main exposition of my four children to this story, the most famous of the stories of the Thousand and One Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Thief of Baghdad has kept their interest until the end. The story moves at a good pace and includes a round or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures all the young actors of today on appeal, judging by the number of times I heard my eldest daughter say, "It's c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won the Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, obviously, those effects seem very dated ("Look, it's Barbie flying in the air" my daughter declared at the sight of the flying genius). Yet they fit well into the story. The film is, after all, over 60 years. The effects fit the script. Furthermore, what is seen in The Thief of Baghdad has remained practically at the cutting edge for the next twenty-five years. Just look at the opening montage of a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In this, it was a good result. <br /> <br /> This qualifies as a family movie, although there are some stabs towards the end. The acting is so obvious and the wounds are as bloodless as those almost artificial scenes like animation. <br /> <br /> All in all, a funny film that is worth watching for both an evening of pure entertainment, and for the historical value of the effects. I advise.
