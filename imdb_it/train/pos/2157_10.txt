All right. As you can see this is one of my favorite movies, if not favorite. This is an absolutely hilarious character drama. The main character is a businessman who is stuck in a "same thing, different day" mentality. He sees a woman wistfully watching a dance studio window from her train every day and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance lesson only to find out that he is not the instructor. From there he ties himself with four other dancers and learns to have fun dancing and discovering the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no free sex (or sex) involved, just as a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. <br /> <br /> This film has been redone with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while the appeal is never as pleasant as the original. The film has never been great in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (the films cannot be published on TV or are banned for Oscar nominations). He has won numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director, etc. For their "Oscar" awards.
