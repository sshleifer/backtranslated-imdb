Several years ago, when I saw "Gray Gardens" for the first time, I remember laughing and finding the field hilarious. Years later I still laugh hard when I look at him, but after many visions I came to see the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and his daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. <br /> <br /> The mother and daughter living together in their decadent East Hampton 28-room room add a whole new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic". With countless cats, raccoons and possum as roommates, this aunt and granddaughter of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles to enter their villa to film them day after day. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving tale of true love and the rule of anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the indissoluble bonds of love. And their lives are an example of unity, determination and free will. This film has more to recommend it than it can express in words. It's a rare experience for you to see. <br /> <br />
