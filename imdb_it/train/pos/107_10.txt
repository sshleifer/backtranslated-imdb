Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film. How's that? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he had with Europa. For me the whole movie was like an experience even though I saw it on a small TV screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, REAL and moving piece of cinema, so most of the films in the top 250. I also think it is perhaps the scariest, most gothic and complete film in circulation . Okay there are also other good ones, but this is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.
