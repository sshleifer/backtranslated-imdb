If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or action in general, this is a must see. Directed by the ace team of the Republic of William Witney and John English, and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this serial offers! I won't bore you with the plot (who cares? Less talking, more fighting); what really matters here is Hadley's superb interpretation of the character (s) and the acrobatic work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence this movie has had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro is captured in the original Star Wars compactor of waste in one chapter, trapped on a rope bridge at the Temple of Doom in another, carries out a transfer of horse to bus of the Raiders and also flees through a tunnel while the villains hit a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, just like Mola Ram does to Indy in Temple of Doom. In addition to all this, the action of the whip is as big as Zorro disarms the bad guys, swings towards salvation, etc. With his trusty eyelashes. Most of the sword work is impartial, apart from chapter one, which presents a terrifying sword fight in a cellar choreographed by sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner, who makes a rare appearance on the evil Rodriguez's screen. This was the first serial I've ever seen, on Matin√©e al Bijou when I was a kid and I've been passionate about them ever since. <br /> <br /> The Zorro Legion Fights offers "Z" goods!
