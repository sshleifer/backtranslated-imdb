I don't think most of us would tend to apply the term "must-see" to action films, but I was very impressed by the film's excellent quality and deservedly deserves the "not to be missed" stamp. <Br /> <br /> Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin, a professional thief to help pull off a diamond hit in a museum for a criminal union and is rewarded handsomely for this. They do not know that another couple of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds), who were first rejected by Mandy and Martin for the deal, are also planning to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> How every couple of thieves plan the robbery is a thrill to watch. Things are bad, as Martin and Mandy unconsciously find themselves a step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these thieves when they find out they need each other to survive the crime. , who are not happy with the fact that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed, because there is a good deal of battles with guns, martial arts and melee combat sequences. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that it is not only the action that brings this film, but the romance and laughter (and I do not mean the typical one-liners prevalent in action films) that are born in. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to cheer for the bad guys, but we can see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and one NOT to lose! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
