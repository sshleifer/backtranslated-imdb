And I'll tell you why: anyone who has decided to modify this film to make it fit for television has been very inconsiderate. EVERYTHING ABOUT DRUGS IS CUT AND COVERED !!! How do they do it, could you ask? Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. However, instead of the marijuana that Cheech and Chong should have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a fog of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way without explanation!
