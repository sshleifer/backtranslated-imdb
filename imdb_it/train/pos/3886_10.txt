Eddie Izzard is brilliant with his uninterrupted humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (such as the Heimlich Maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think. I don't know when I laughed so much with someone's off-beat mind.
