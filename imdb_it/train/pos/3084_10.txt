Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all connected by someone. If you focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this show, it didn't catch my attention. It seemed too normal actually. Then, I saw some episodes ... and I loved it! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is an alcohol addict, a woman whose girlfriend betrays her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on ... Unlike what we are used to, most characters interact with each other in accidents, as in our daily routines. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> So the cast. They are all fantastic. Jay Hernandez, of "Hostel", shows here his acting skills in a more 3D character than his previous work as Paxton. The others also give great shows, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb, after seeing some episodes, I couldn't believe it. It was seriously deleted, I can't understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> Too bad we didn't have more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!
