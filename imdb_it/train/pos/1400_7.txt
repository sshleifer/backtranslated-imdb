Bogmeister and others have practically nailed this. Shore Leave is actually the first attempt at a lightweight sci-fi TOS (which they later perfected with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). He gave the crew of the Enterprise and its viewers a necessary respite from the universe that threatens the consequences of, for example, The Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place to relax for a while, the Enterprise happens across an apparently idyllic M-class planet, and sends an exploration team to take a closer look. Soon all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly dangerous - but everything seems like a swamp of human emotional extremes played in a strange mixture of fantastic mystery (McCoy crossed the mirror), a psychological thriller (Kirk is being followed by a tireless boss his past), and romantic comedy (no comment). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all the series in the Trek series, so it's easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on the heavy and potentially calamitous drama. Unlike the later series franchise writers, the TOS production team was not afraid to literally go where TV series never existed. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on the ST issues. The last scene is probably one of the worst scenes I can remember of the entire TOS race - both in composition and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendation: watch it while watching the entire first season as it should have been seen: order.
