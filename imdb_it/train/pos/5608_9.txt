Of course, it quickly became erratic after this film, but from "Knife In the Water" to "The Tenant", Roman Polanski has always been able to count on something fascinating and unique. Despite many running themes (alienation, paranoia), two of his films are not the same. The story of this is somewhat similar to his "Repulsion" ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. "The Tenant" manages to balance the darkest obscurity of absurdity (I'm a little hesitant to call it humor, even if the protagonists are bizarre behavior and occasionally funny dialogues) with a really suspenseful paranoia. Polanski has always been a master at creating discomfort, and the moments in this film are almost unbearably disturbing. The general strangeness of the film is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Polanski's exquisite direction as usual, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions. Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by Polanski, the director, but his performance here really captures his characters, the embarrassment and the feeling of being an outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this film more of an oddity for the sake of being strange. The rest of the cast also offers excellent performances, in particular the comprehensive turnaround of Isabelle Adjani, and those of Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters in an appropriately annoying manner. "The Tenant" is often underestimated by how ready people are to praise both "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but it is just as brilliant as both classics. (9/10)
