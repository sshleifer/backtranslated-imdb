This is one of the best Jackies movies that is without him Samson Hung and Yuen Biao has one of the best openings in every action movie and hopefully this way with Jackie showing some high quality stunts the only criticism is that in in the middle it gets a bit slow, but it turns out for the last 25 frantic minutes in the movie and the credits show what a crazy fool Jackie Chan is just to make us happy movies
