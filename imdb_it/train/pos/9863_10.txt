I thought the ice age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman without children, I really seem to appreciate these humorous and witty films. Sid is the best character I've ever seen for a while, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although it was really fun, and I didn't think his character could be matched or even defeated) and even more fun than Melman in Madagascar . I have seen the film at least 15 times (I have it of course) and I quote the film at work (on many occasions ... yes, again). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to understand what the squirrel is trying to tell them about "tigers" ... "Pack of wolves, pack of bears, flea pack, mustache pack, pack of noses, pack of derma? pack of lies, a lot of problems, an avalanche, a bunch of birds, a bunch of flying fish ... "or at least that part goes! This is the funniest part of the whole movie, although I really liked the humor of "putting sloths on the map" and also many other parts. The only animated film that can be compared at a distance with the Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
