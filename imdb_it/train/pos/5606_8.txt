This is a very difficult film, and it's almost impossible to understand how it's going. At first it seems to be a rather pedestrian film about a boy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and rather crassively he invents himself in one when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then the twists begin. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why do the dead tenants' clothes show up in the apartment? One wonders, finally, if Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks that Polanski draws is to lie to us. We assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume when the camera shows us things from its omniscient point of view that we see current events - but Polanski has the camera for us.
