I don't think anyone other than Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung make films at a purer level than Claire Denis. Having said that, I don't like this, his last film, as much as his 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (even if it comes very close), which in turn is one of my favorite films ever. It's just because the description here is perhaps a little too elliptical for his own good. Don't get me wrong, the fact that this movie barely has a plot is really one of the best things, but I think Denis took a degree further than necessary and consequently the film flirts with incomprehensibility, and some key points of the plot should have been clarified in some way (like what the main character goes to South Korea to have his heart transplanted, instead of suddenly showing it there without any explanation of where he is or why he is there). Also some of the other characters seemed useless and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use the actors that he still likes (the character of Beatrice Dalle, in particular, is a little distracted because you continue to expect that it will have a meaning). Still, the film is incredibly engaging and the cinematography is incredible. It is definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis's most acclaimed "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite French director at this point, even better than Leos Carax. I must also admit that the South Korean sequence really does "Lost in Translation" better than that movie itself (and I, unlike some, I am also a big fan of that movie).
