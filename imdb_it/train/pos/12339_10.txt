Beloved Joan. Great performance. In what is not good. I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre soon after ... she keeps getting better. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm glad to have it on the video. I don't know what you need most in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detective ...... a try ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very nice . I wonder what the budget was for this movie? I wish they were still making movies like this. Every time they try they just seem to make a cheese film. Black and white films still retain a certain mystery.
