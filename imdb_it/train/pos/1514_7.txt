With some of Hammer's stars, this very effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fate of previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a Scottish construction site detective, looking for a missing actor. <br /> <br /> Story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who have just moved into the house and plan to stay only for a short time so who can write one of his horror novels. He creates a demented character named Dominic, who is a disturbing-looking strangler, and soon finds himself going crazy as he begins to see this beastly-looking man wherever he goes. After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub plot is introduced which, frankly, didn't really work for me. I don't want to ruin everything for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) sees the wonderful Peter Cushing in the role of Philip Grayson, a man who has been moved home for his retirement years and will soon make his way for a nearby wax museum (which takes care of the macabre) where he is very surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman of his past. Shortly thereafter, an old friend (who also has a history with this woman) is in town on business and goes to see it. The two men are preparing for a rude awakening, soon discovering that there is much more to this woman than it seems. <br /> <br /> A three-star story one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving into the house with his peculiar daughter Jane, the nanny he hires becomes terribly suspicious of the way Reid suppresses his daughter. Well, come and find out ... if he knew what Lee did, he would surely understand. <br /> <br /> The final story is a rather light vampire tale featuring John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, the actor Paul Henderson finds himself turning into the same creature he has played several times in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pace and direction were very good, as was most of the performances. There were nice Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complete the atmosphere. This is a caretaker and comes highly recommended.
