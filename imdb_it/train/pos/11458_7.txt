Greetings still from the darkness. Insight on the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... regardless of conditions, otherwise his life reason ceases. Seeing Goldsworthy's sculptures come to life and seeing his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. It's his life force. When you see his failures, the energy seems to be expelled from his body like a balloon. It is not the terror of starting over, it is that it takes its energy from its work. Watching him create just to take nature and remember his work is a bit painful, but still breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in the minimal dialogue and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one. When he says he needs the earth, but he doesn't need him ... I dare to disagree. The only complaint is that the musical score seems to slow down a pace that is relaxing at best.
