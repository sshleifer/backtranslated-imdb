This supernatural thriller by Peter Weir is truly one of the most disturbing and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain makes his best performance here as the Australian lawyer defending a group of Aboriginal youths charged with murder. As he approaches the case, he finds out more about the main defendant, Chris, and no less about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appears to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave, the one that will drown the world. <br /> <br /> Dream sequences and supernatural effects enhance this film and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles, as is the guy with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the old aborigine who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending do not disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers that fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this cannot be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and speaks of spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
