I'm a big fan of M Lillard and that's why I ended up watching this movie. I honestly doubt that if it weren't in the movie I would love it or just watch it but once I saw it, I realized that the story was pretty decent. I have to say a bad ending but I saw it coming. It's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't very good, but overall I rated this movie 7/10. The suspense of wondering what Lillard actually was was what really kept me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
