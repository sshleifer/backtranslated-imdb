I really liked this film overall, but four things really stand out: the perfect comic moment and the performance of Sam Raimi as the practical man of the field, the wonderful characterization of Alan Arkin's field owner and, above all cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of the external scenes drag me into the film like a sunset on the lake shore and attract me in my summer memories. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and atmosphere are very natural and credible. Some reviewers criticize the lack of a "deeper" script. For me, it is precisely this lack that makes this film work. The characters and their problems seem real and for this reason, I am interested in what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a set that looks right.
