This is not a bad movie. Follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is the film of a film, the famous actress who runs for her life in the first scene. This film takes the old convention of a psychopath on him, and manages to do something new and interesting with it. It's always nice to see Molly Ringwald again for the attack. <br /> <br /> So this could be an example of what the genre has become. The cut affects all the signs, and is actually scary in some parts. I liked it I gave it an eight.
