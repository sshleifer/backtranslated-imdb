I never saw the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until I read the other comments here, I didn't know this movie was the 'prize' of that competition. I was simply turning channels upside down and I came across this, and found myself looking, daring, to the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was done (The Most Dangerous Game, etc.) But I hoped, and almost received, the "gotcha" - as the protagonist would eventually beat the hunter. I think high-tech was overdone (GPS) and gave me flashbacks of the Night Rider's cold sweat, but still it wasn't too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The basic problem I had with this film was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Incrbelief) that was required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter can launch countless incendiary grenades in a public bridge and NO COPS shows up to investigate? Can a limousine make countless donuts at an intersection in Las Vegas and DO NOT present itself to COPS? Pleeease. Too much of that kind of thing - fun to watch, but at least so plausible, thanks. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the aftertaste of a bad Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the acting was so trivial - except for Zane, who doesn't get so close to the work IMHO deserves - they were the winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Float me.
