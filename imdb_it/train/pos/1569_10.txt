I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats so different from one another, yet they refer to themselves collectively as "brothers". I often find myself trying to imitate the tired and suspicious accent of the butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish district of Gordon. There should be more episodes made on Human Kimberly. The episode about cats who dress up as pre-teen girls to gain admission to Human Kimberly's slumber party to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We can't drink the rootbeer in our house without doing the Catscratch rumors or the Hanson Brothers of the movie 'Slap Shot.' Classic of the future Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD ??
