"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins recklessly in mid-chase and explodes in an impetuous way as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks the minds behind the CIA black-ops who turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A terribly cold David Strathairn as "the man behind the scenes" has been added to the cast of regular actors including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). <br /> <br /> Like the second series, I wanted Paul Greengrass's flickering camcorder to become static for at least the few minutes of inactivity. However, having said that, it is a perfect way to capture the tense and claustrophobic feel of hand-to-hand combat scenes and works equally well in hunting scenes that are mostly on foot and on rooftops with the occasional pile of cars - on . Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant shifting and manipulation of technologies and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne's films seem to exist in a sort of gritty hyperreality full of technology-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be in the right place at the right time, but I'd be damned if it wasn't an explosion to see them get there. <br /> <br /> With the absence of the emotional and engaging of Franka Potente, the writers try to create an emotional bond between Damon and Stiles, but she is such a pale actress that she never leads to anything. However, this can be forgiven, because unlike "Identity" and "Supremacy", this "Ultimatum" reveals everything and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have a good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect ending to it.
