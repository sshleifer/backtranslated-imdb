I can't believe these games can go much better, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even if I beat it I can't wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I have to own all of them even though I've beaten them many times. I hope they will never stop playing this type of game even if the series ends. <br /> <br />
