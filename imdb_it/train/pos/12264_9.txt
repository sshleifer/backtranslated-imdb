If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin ... do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary on Hergé and his life that creates Tintin. They are such a brilliant and fantastic production. The whole story of Hergé and the people and also the many different situations in which he was influenced, for better or for worse, is surprising. There is a very nice and obvious connection between the comics and just that. I will definitely be in my basement digging Tintin's albums again. Moreover, the film itself is very well told and has an excellent environmental sound. I really hope people will find it as intriguing as me!
