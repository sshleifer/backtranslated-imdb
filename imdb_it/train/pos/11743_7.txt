Although this was not without flaws, this drama was suitable to be shown during the Easter period. It reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least the rap teenagers who provided better musical accompaniment to the drama than the poor sound score in the background. The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again superb. The climax was very satisfying, although rather simplistic. The "letting go" to Timothy Spall of his late wife's suicide was credible and reflected well the feelings of despair that were present in the adolescent who harmed himself. The resolution between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was gratifying but less credible. A marvelous drama that left me and my husband down that the evening had been well spent. Congratulations!
