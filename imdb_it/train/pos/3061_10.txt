This film shows the kind of ensemble work you want in each film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are chilling, discussing "family affairs" as if it were a grocery store or dry cleaner. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also fantastic. They play each other as members of a first-rate theater troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support others in a disinterested way. And finally, there's Sammy (David Dorfman). What an extraordinary show as a child ... and what an incredible resemblance he has with Ullman, whose son plays! <br /> <br /> We have been treated to a unique story in "Panic", and it is a rarity in these days of cloying formidable derision. The dialogue is strong and intelligent, and this relatively short film, however, has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, be shocked, be terrified, saddened, excited, angry and loved. It's not a movie that lets you jump for joy, but when it's over you're more than satisfied knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes experimenting with a great job. <br /> <br /> Others of us go to the theaters if we were treated to a quality fare like this. When will the powers of Hollywood wake up? It's a shame when something so beautiful can't get visibility beyond festivals and families lucky enough to have cable.
