What a wonderful and imaginative film "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice it to say that you could consider it a very strong recommendation to go and see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems willing to force remakes and sequels into the throat, "Stardust" reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives, other times or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us in all three places effortlessly and with a childlike joy that we all desire. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. She has a damsel in distress, the hero, thieves, obstacles, spells, antidotes, amulets and even a touch of light speed to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from the city of Wall, who is conveniently located near a wall that separates their city from a magical kingdom. The only way to get through the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old coward (wonderfully played by David Kelly). One day a young man from the Wall named Ben Barnes maneuvered the old guard and escaped through the breech. It happens in an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a young (and very sexy) chained by the name of Una. She is held captive by a witch and kept on a leash by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is away, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is called to the bulletin board where the old guard hands him what you would expect: a child. <br /> <br /> The boy, named Tristan, becomes a rather unfortunate young man (Charlie Cox) who is struck by a girl out of his league and also betrothed to another. However, the young woman (whose name is Victoria and played Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses her love. After discovering a shooting star, she tells him she can have it if she recovers the star and brings it back to her. He accepts and takes part in his research, which will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile in the realm of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. Call his remaining living sons to tell them who will succeed him to the throne. The names of his sons are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other children killed by other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> However, it launches its charm ruby ​​to the sky and Voila, what brings the star to the earth. <br /> <br /> The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she obviously wears her charm. But little does he know that now he is persuaded by Tristain, the Princes and also an old witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut the heart of the stars to regain her youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But everything takes place while the adventure takes place. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by her devotion to Victoria that she does not recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. His initial interest lies only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But first he must overcome the princes and Lamia. The principles are not a big problem as they constantly try to kill each other - and just like in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets the witch who enslaved her mother (even if she doesn't know who she is her mother) and a flying pirate band led by Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> His is the most important character in the film and DeNiro plays it on a tee. Steal the film with its hardness and soon we learn a hidden secret that will leave the audience on the floor with a laugh. Although his role is short, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is as wonderful as Lamia, a sexy and evil witch. Claire Danes is the most appropriate as a confused and distressed Yvaine. She makes a perfect damsel. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of lightness to the fighting principles that, when they die, return as ghosts to the "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directing experience was "Layer Cake", weaves a charming story that everyone will appreciate. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be too complex for small children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to watch this movie multiple times. It's so beautiful. "Stardust" is what movies should be. Perfectly written, perfectly fused, perfectly direct and perfectly acted. In other words ... perfect.
