John Waters has made the smallest, most sparkling, heartfelt, obscure, personal film I think I've ever seen (well, maybe Fast Food Fast Women takes a back seat) The directors' vision is pristine ... the narrative is extravagant, the characters they are personal and bizarre reflections of the family and its inner life ... the tone is never forced or stylistically excessive. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious pose design, even a magazine evaluation ... Martha Plimpton is amazing like her sister ... Eddie furlong is inspired by casting. A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea bags, recycled clothes, yesterday's garbage becomes today's art - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can evaluate is the family ... and a humble life.
