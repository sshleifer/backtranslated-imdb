<br /> <br /> This film is by far one of my favorites. I saw him while I was in college in the early 90s, and while I couldn't identify with the 30-year-olds in the film, I felt that the story, the characters and the film in general were top notch. To people who have spoken negatively about Indian Summer, feel free to stick to your exaggerated Armageddon type films and leave the films with a fantastic and healthy story for those who can appreciate them.
