Tony Hawk Underground came to a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 was not up to expectations and left the series really in the air about what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced the story mode, which was very interesting because it created a new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature introduced that the fans practically discussed and was able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because now you can really climb, run and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft has also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of level projects. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were fantastic because the levels were beautiful and long and some features hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened due to a handful of features that have been added and have really pushed the systems to their limits. In this version, they have shortened these characteristics, there is not a lot of people who ask for the streets, in reality there are hardly any in some levels, and the graphics and physics of skating are attenuated a little but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game has a scam, the plot is a bit short, obviously this is the first time Neversofts does this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, having said that, you will end up completing this game in one day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.
