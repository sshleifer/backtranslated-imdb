Mardi Gras: Made in China offers a wonderful and intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the creation and launch of beads. I saw this movie at the International Film Festival in Boston, and I expected a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a compelling display of shocking images from both China and the United States. The eye-opening film is humorous, in-depth, serious, not condescending, and lets you desire more like the role of credits. It's worth comparing to Murderball: it's simply so well done. Young female workers in China have different points of view, and the owner is extraordinarily open about the discipline. Carnival revelers are the highlight, but only because this excellent film provides an in-depth context within the factory in China without narration. Good for the director to enter and finish the film! I never thought about the connection between pearls, China and New Orleans; now I think of the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling guilty after seeing this movie, unlike other globalization movies I've seen.
