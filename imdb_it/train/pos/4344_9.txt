The film enters into the tension between a son and a father. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dialogue, the enchanting landscapes and the great acting serve as a great way to present the onion that continues to scrape the layers. /> <br /> The central themes of parenting, communication and virility are explored indirectly. <br /> <br /> In an amusing way the curtain is pulled back, the masks slip away a little and the truths are exposed. <br /> <br /> All this happens in a travel format. The background is the rural state of New York at the beginning of autumn just as the trees change color. WOW!
