If you've ever seen the trailer for the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never have to see that movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance also had telltale trailerers alike. <br /> <br /> The history of the Renaissance speaks of a detective investigating the abduction of a young woman and a medical researcher. The setting is a futuristic Paris and science fiction elements are present everywhere. But the special thing about the Renaissance is its visual style, and not its history. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized in black and white with extremely sharp contrasts. The result seems stunning (even if the 3D animation problems of human beings are still evident from time to tome: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facial actions, etc.). especially visually. However, history and writing are not exactly at the same level of image quality. It's not a bad story (and presumably, if you haven't seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not very original, and touches the trivial. Some lines of dialogue were painfully trivial, making writing seem like a beginner's first attempt. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. It's different from anything I've seen before, visually, and I believe that its originality alone makes it a useful experience. It's also a watchable story, even if it's not perfect.
