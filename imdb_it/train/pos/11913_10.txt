This is an excellent film for female bodybuilder and female action fans! I think Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. It has a very surprising appearance and an iron will to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not a film of great value and the acting skills of Sue Price are not the best to meet in my life, the film itself has been something exceptional, a priceless gem for fans of the female body-builder action ! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied from other famous science fiction movies, like Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn threw a very talented bodybuilder into the film who put all his energy and body talent into showing us the best he could do. I really enjoyed that movie and watched Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3) with the same enthusiasm. What a pity he hasn't shown on DVD yet :-(
