This James Bond game is the best bond game I've played in my life, it's my favorite James Bond game so far because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are so much fun they can be really hard that make it more fun to play missions have many actions the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are fantastic, car missions have a lot of action and are really fun to play. The voice over the actors is really good and it's nice that Sean Connery makes the voice for James Bond even the way the look bond is very nice because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in the movies and the other character seems more or less the same as the look of the film. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. The game also follows the movie more or less but not all, but most of the time it makes it look good. <br /> <br /> overall score ********** on ***** *****
