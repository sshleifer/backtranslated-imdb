Since musicals have gone out of style and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract in a studio, I doubt we'll ever have a true life story of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if all else was in place, it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the assignment until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done it, I doubt it will ever be tried again. <br /> <br /> And why should it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied with how his singing was portrayed on the screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that the freedoms have been taken with his life must be modest. Caruso, like the man who painted him, was a man of great appetites even though with much more self-discipline. He has had numerous relationships with several women and has generated two children out of wedlock who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is considered almost an afterthought. He was shown in a recording studio once he was late in his life. In fact, he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it has become. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights, you basically had to inherit a ticket to see both perform live. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a phonograph and a record or three of these two men. This is why both have become legends. <br /> <br /> What the film has are some beautifully represented opera arias by Mario Lanza, a taste of what might have become if he had the discipline of a Caruso to stick to the opera. The Grande Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costumes and set designs. Mario himself helped popularize the film with an album by The Great Caruso RCA Red Seal. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations it was not possible to get a real cast with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza recorded a big hit of The Most Beautiful Night of the Year, further helping to release The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this is not it. If you are looking for a great artist who sings at the peak of his career, you can't miss The Great Caruso.
