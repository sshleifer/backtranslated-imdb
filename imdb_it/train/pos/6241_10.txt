at the beginning I had the reaction of many people left after seeing this: those shots of fat people sunbathing, etc. they were low-cost shots in a sense. OK, so it's doing diane arbus you meet. . . everything. . . but it was not long before I realized that this was not done in a dehumanizing way, while the images unraveled I felt that the problem was entirely of the public: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also films from almost everywhere in reality to feel that we look people over a certain age to behave in a sexual way is something inconvenient, something that should not be shown. if this were the whole movie offered it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the violent boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent narrative, incredible performances and thinking that the scene was improvised. that blond boy is a genius actor. in the end I want to contradict those who say that this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is in the making with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an OK character who breaks that shape, so don't over-simplify the film by neglecting it. yes his dog is killed. this is not a rosy picture of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless. however, I felt really grateful to the director for making such a beautiful film. I wouldn't say that each of the discussions was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this movie basically kicks your ass and we highly recommend it. . .
