This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing in the role of a man who abandoned his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm abandoned him. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he will try for a baseball team if he does. They win (partly because of all the joke practices they take with a coach that can exceed 90 miles per hour), and keep his part of the deal - and it's signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, the story of Jim Morris will resound. It is moving and stimulating, and man's relationships sound true. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I rent this, though. Dennis Quaid is simply purdy in the part, and a baseball film with a handsome man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​paradise. Sir, if you feel like me, check this out.
