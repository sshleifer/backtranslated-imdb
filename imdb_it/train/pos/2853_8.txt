In the end I saw this movie tonight after renting it to Blockbuster (VHS). I must say that it is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters haven't been fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. Rather, we are treated with the eye of the director, his vision of what the story is about. And it doesn't stop. And to be honest, I didn't want to do it. I think Sabu had to influence the director of "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I absolutely loved the way the three lead to SEE the beautiful woman on the road to distract them momentarily. I really need to see this director's other work because this film really intrigued me. If you want intuition, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal laughter, look here.
