I come to Pinjar from a completely different context than most of the other reviewers who published here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the United States. So I don't have a broad base to compare Pinjar with other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is necessary. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands alone as nothing but a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In a row, I can say that Pinjar is one of the most important films to get out of any studio anywhere and at any time. According to a mass scale, * it may * have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if it had been adequately promoted in the United States. This may have been the film that put Bollywood on the American map. The American film audience has a long-standing love story with "Gone with the Wind", and while Pinjar does not borrow from that plot there are some similarities. The not least important is the chronometer (according to US standards) of 183 minutes of execution. <br /> <br /> Set against the harsh scenario of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48 it is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and driven into trouble that she had no way of creating. Put in an unsustainable position, he somehow manages not only to survive, but to grow - and even to prosper. <br /> <br /> If the story is missing in any way, it is in the exhibition. The growth of Puro (the protagonist) as a person would have been better illustrated - at least for the Western public who did not know Indian culture - if the "backstage" of his character was more fully developed in the first part of the film. But this would have lengthened a film of 3 hours to 3 1/2 hours or maybe even more. Because not a single minute of the film is wasted, and none of what made it out of the editing could really be cut for the time. Better that the public should partially fill in what happened before leaving nothing of what remains. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "poignant", "disturbing", "irresistible", "heartbreaking" come to mind immediately. But "edifying" is perhaps the most appropriate of anyone else. Any story that highlights the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst odds must be considered as such. And Puro's triumph - though perhaps not immediately apparent to those around it - is no less than a source of inspiration. As for the strength of the story, I can't recommend this movie enough. <br /> <br /> Equally stimulating is the portrait of Puro by Urmila Matondkar. Too often overlooked among younger younger actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to offer a completely credible character in every role she plays. He does not simply play the part of Puro, but breathes life into the character. Manoj Bajpai's choice as Rashid was inspired. He handles something that too few heroes of Indian cinema can: subtlety. His command of expression and nuance is essential for the role. It brings more threat to the first part of the film with its penetrating gaze than all the sword-armed rioters united. <br /> <br /> If you only see a Bollywood movie in your life, do Pinjar.
