An excellent film and a great example of how scary a film can be without really showing anything to the public. It's a series of four stories that revolve around the tenants of an old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrible fates, all linked by an enveloping story about a Scotland Yard inspector in search of a disappeared horror movie star. Start with a story about a mysterious writer whose main character gets a little too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed with a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a sweetly angelic child who is far from it, and closing with the story of what happened to the missing movie star ?? and what it does to the inspector. It's a beautiful print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you have a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just don't answer the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls you to offer you a deal in a nice house in the English countryside ??
