I only know another movie that could compete with Opening Night and this is Bergman's Person. Both films are simply fantastic, they have a wealth of ideas that are difficult to grasp at first sight. We have a profound meditation on the relationship between art and life as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character who is acting on the stage than she would like. The accidental death of one of her fans, a girl who declares her love for Myrtle and is then hit by a car, leaves a deep mark on the actress. Start asking yourself questions about aging that begin to affect you until the only solution becomes alcohol. But this doesn't help much and Mirtilla is one step away from complete madness. The scene in which he kills the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I found in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a show of genius in favor of the director as he films a theatrical scene in which he and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, since Myrtle is too drunk for the opening night to perform her part accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, laughter is genuine, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely incredible. If you liked Persona or you are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas and great entertainment, this movie will do you good.
