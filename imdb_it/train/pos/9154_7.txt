Very good except for the finale which was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was very good as was the acting. The images were often very grainy, but in a sense added to the film because the snow-covered features were in good condition which helped to create a mood for the film. This effect was ruined by the extremely incredible finish. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie an 8 out of ten, but the ending beat a point at 7 because it seemed to start from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed forced enough to make the filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> But this film was much better than movies with much bigger budgets and seemed to be shot as a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in terms of special effects like these, but for the suspense it was very good.
