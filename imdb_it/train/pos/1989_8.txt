I admit I'm not fond of Oliver! as a child - it's long, and the story is a bit slow due to all the musical numbers. As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this film is the experience itself. Rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of classical history. The adaptation is loose at best, but in reality, if you're watching a musical, you're not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is the heart of this film, and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy Most or all of the cast has been involved in the theatrical version of the musical, and it shows in their performances - and I consider this a plus. The performances are all in a style of acting more "stage" typical of older films and are very funny. The exception is the child who plays Oliver, whose work seems to be nice and stay out of the reality of real artists. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this film. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating presence on the screen like the menacing Bill Sykes. Sykes Bullseye's dog also performs well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise it, as will those who take musicals too seriously. Finding defective historical details or exchanging exaggerated theatrical recitations for bad acting would ruin anyone's fun. Sit down and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that, like a musical, it's a fantasy freely organized around the book, not a rigorous adaptation.
