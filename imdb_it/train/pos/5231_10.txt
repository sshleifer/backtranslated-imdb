communicate in the film the essential things of life - what life is like, does it have meaning? - It's absolutely impossible. Of course the possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to the conscience. This happens if the input of the senses prevails over the input from our mind, that is our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky, it's one. His "Stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as it appears and yet escapes your mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same.
