Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you don't have any, you can't understand it. And if you don't understand, you can't have fun. :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a car produced by Citroen, you will probably simply go through it if you see a Picasso painting, deciding that it is a garbage from some street painter. :) So don't judge, before trying to figure it out :) In the end I think it's a MUST for everyone with open minds. Still my N1 remains The Redemption Shawshank! And remember that not all things can be framed. Because there are things in this world, that any frame will not go well.
