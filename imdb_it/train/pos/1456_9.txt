Documentaries of this type are often very prominent. This film seems to take all the opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad the conditions in which these poor people have to work, this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops. The movie Mardi Gras: Made in China was a good way to show the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration could affect the lives of so many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this film for an English course in which we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this movie helped to get people moving 'topic. It was a fantastic film, very informative and I would recommend anyone to see it, it opens your eyes.
