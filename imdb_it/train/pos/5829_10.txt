This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts, and undoubtedly the best performance by Christine McIntyre with the trio. She is good at many other short films, but here is absolutely brilliant. His singing is not at all funny, on the contrary it is decidedly beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that singing enhances humor rather than belittles. We listen to McIntyre singing the entirety of Voice of Spring no less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we don't tire of his voice, and partly because it blends so well with Stooges' antics. The use of operatic soprano in a comedy recalls the role of Kitty Carlisle in the "A Night At The Opera" by the Marx Brothers, but singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in "Opera" and McIntyre (perhaps more in others performances here) exhibited a comic talent of its own that Carlisle never did. The Stooges buffoonery, McIntyre's singing and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
