Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you appeared in a movie, and what a movie it was, it was 24 no, but very intriguing, especially with a professional like Michael Douglas as secret agent of the secret services. The character of Kiefer is the one that chases Michael Douglas throughout the film, Kiefer's partner, is Eva Longoria, the desperate housewife. wow she can really act as well as flirt all day and look good, I hope Kim Bassinger has had a bigger role, but other than that, I really think the whole movie was explosive from start to finish . This film is what I consider a political thriller, everyone played their part to the end. nothing has been revealed to Sooon in the film, so you can guess at any time. and I really think that Kiefer did a job like this in this movie, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the performance of the day, thumbs up.
