Robert Urich was a good actor and makes this TV movie believable. I remember seeing this film when I was 15 and when I see it a second time my opinion remains the same. People lose who they were when they entered this exclusive club, in a Californian city full of computers. Urich tries to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I love the idea of ​​a genius Halloween space suit. This film is about the battle of a spirit. The quality of TV, which exceeds, the big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his films? I hope! 6 or 7 out of 10.
