Also known as "Water Lilies", this film tells the story of two girls making their way into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and works very well. It gives a lot of time and space to get to know the different characters and grow somehow attached to them. <br /> <br /> The use of a small cast puts a little more pressure on the people who play as they have a little more screen time than normal but the people who play in this movie manage well. All are completely credible. The visual setting is exceptional, especially the underwater shots in the pool add a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made on the same subject and this is not different from any of them. It extracts some "standard" pressure methods from the cylinder and works on them. It's not bad, not at all, but surely it's not even nice and I think he could have done better if he had taken some less explored corners. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
