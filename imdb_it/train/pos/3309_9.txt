This is a great movie. If this is a clue, Hong Sang-Soo is really "the best kept secret of Asian cinema". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers many of the same thematic themes, but I think it actually amuses me more on the whole than any single of their films. Manifested minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work, although it still fits that style perfectly (the camera never moves once even), and somehow I found the film less aware of "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao -si, which I think is part of the reason I liked it best. Furthermore, he does not keep his subjects as detached as Hou. It seemed to me that the film was also somehow more "complete" and less open (barely) than some of their works, although this does not mean that it had much of something that resembled an evolving plot. I would have had difficulty believing that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman who wanders alone and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk underpants can only look familiar).
