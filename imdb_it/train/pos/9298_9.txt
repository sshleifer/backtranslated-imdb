Simply, one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of criminal life, a parody of everything that represents Chicago in 1930. There is really no need to underestimate this film because the evaluation is less than 5. It is a mass opinion, and the mass is hypnotized. Whoever decides to look at him - he will regret, Who will decide not to look at him - he will regret more.
