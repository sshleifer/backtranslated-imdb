Maybe I'm a little weak but this is the sweetest movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5 years old, and I shouted my eyes. Between then and now (embarrassed at the age of 15) I saw him over 25 times and sobbed each and every one. Don't worry, they are tears of happiness! And it's not all sap! There is also a lot of humor and comedy. Usually the whole animal talking thing can be a great resistance, but in this film it is not the case. My only advice: even if you love it, don't see the sequel ... cornismo! I suggest everyone check it ... you won't mind, no matter how old or young you are!
