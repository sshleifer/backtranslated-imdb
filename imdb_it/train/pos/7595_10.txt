Lost is not the biggest TV show in history, but it is not far away. It doesn't have the plot or characterization of The West Wing or maybe even the first ER, however, it is undoubtedly the most compelling show I've ever encountered. I love the way I can't guess what's going to happen. I love the re-narration of the secondary stories of the characters that often give rise to new dimensions in which we can see them. Somehow I want the show to last forever, but I think they can get 6-7 seasons from this before they have to end up on a glorious high. The combination of the characters and their nationalities combined with the fluidity of the show in moving back and forth, thus extending the dead sparks of the dead characters, adds an overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are accustomed. It's captivating, surprising and (here is a little suggestion for all you conspiracy theorists) rather than a bit interactive - keep the discussions on the Internet going - you're just adding to the plot ...
