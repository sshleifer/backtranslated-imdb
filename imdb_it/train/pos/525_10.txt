Immediately after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to find something to try to rectify the rift that is developing between the United Kingdom and the United States. At the time there was a lot of comments "Overpaid, over sexed over here". Somehow they invented this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. It has everything. Romanticism, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very eccentric. <br /> <br /> I can never explain why, but it hits all the right buttons and even if I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still sure to be in tears at many points in everything. <br /> <br /> Was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script? Who knows. But * DO * look at it and see what I mean.
