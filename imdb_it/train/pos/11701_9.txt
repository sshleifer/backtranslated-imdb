This is a great movie for all Generation X'ers. What a different world 1972 America has been compared to our psychotic 21st century. You can get an idea of ​​how 1972's America went when you watched this movie. I discovered that the car's clothes and styles brought me fascinating memories of a country much better than what we have now. Think ... in those days there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There were no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, bird flu, highway snipers, etc. The Vietnam War was just over. There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and the internet would still be 29 years away. <br /> <br /> When this film was released, the producers had to commercialize the film by themselves, as no other film producer wanted it. Thus began to visit the small Protestant churches throughout the country that were projected on film projectors (this was the period prior to the VCRS, of course). The pastor of a church that would be interested in showing A thief in the light of his congregation would get a copy of the film. Then he would organize an evening to show it in the church meeting room or in the dining room. Congregation members will invite unsaved friends and family and it would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the limited production values ​​of the film and only watch it for its nostalgic value, then I think you will appreciate the film more. Of course I'm talking as a gen xer. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine I would go back in 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspit we have now.
