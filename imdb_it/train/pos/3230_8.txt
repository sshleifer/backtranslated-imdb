OK, so Soldier is not as deep and meaningful as Blade Runner or as a budget for Terminator 2, but overall I found it very funny. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell remained in the character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through the most touching. I found his portrait of a narrower emotional development more touching than Arnie's in T's movies (and before receiving comments yes, I know Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise proposed by both films was the same) . > <br /> So for the film itself, a reasonable American / British cast can enrich this little story. I'm not sure that Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad guys, so he wasn't able to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic or a wrong group of peace loving / gullible / cowards who were wiped out by the envelope, or a group of aggressive subversive paranoid terrorists on other worlds and each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and, unlike other comments, I don't think this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike perhaps Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really made his late father proud by continuing the lineage of the Sci-Fi family. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people who make the most of a bad situation and don't hurt too much. <br /> <br /> If you see it on your TV program I would advise you to give it a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
