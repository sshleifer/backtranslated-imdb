A unique film ... one of the best of all time. Acting, screenplay, Quincy Jones soundtrack, cinematography, editing, etc. - simply fantastic. As many viewers know, this film is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas peasant family (the Clutters) by a couple of young people during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that has turned such a true story into a compelling film so brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the police team that persecutes them. Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickock is incredible. Condom, nervous and devoid of compassion, comes across in a fascinating, unctuous and plausible way. Even Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary, solitary and at the same time empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could bend these characteristics into an individual and make us buy it? It does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very different sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and hateful crime, and these two actors make it work magnificently. Both have had moments in their later careers, but these performances have high water ratings, and that means acting. <br /> <br /> Even the cops are wonderful. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also fantastic. Unlike contemporary films in which producers consider it necessary to equip the police with superhuman resources or weaknesses, these are just real flat feet, working at the checkout with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen screen cops so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen many of the crime classics go back in time. Truly unique in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL ENTERTAINMENT COMING (this film is unique because you already know what happened, but I'm warning for the record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes of the best shows and crime films are the interrogations - the intellectual fencing encounters between the policemen and the criminals, Mano a Mano. This film has its hands on the best interrogation scenes you'll see on the film. He looks at Dick and Perry trying to make their way and they unravel slowly, unaware that the cops have the goods on them. But the cops must skillfully prepare their suspects to break their alibis and hope to raise confessions. This is the best acting you've ever seen. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and horrible corners of this true story, ICB was shot in the current Clutter house, and I heard that the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feeling. It works. These look like normal, simple people. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. <br /> <br /> I stop here. It is not a good film, but it is one of the best films ever made and so unique, it is a mandatory vision for every film lover.
