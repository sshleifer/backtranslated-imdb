_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against the actors, the story of old actors whose careers are slowly less active than they once were, but an extraordinary tribute to French actors and their cinema. <br /> <br /> Supported by a solid reflection on cinema and acting (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play the their role (not to be confused with life in front of the camera - the film is not a voyeur) is rather vague, and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the film quite entertaining. Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play her part (great actress, she is hilarious in earnest especially when, in the role of Dussolier, she scolds herself), while the actors run opposite each other to ask for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, we recognize the pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played. <br /> <br /> Actually, for those unfamiliar with the actors (most of them are at least 50 years old) or do it I don't know French cinema, this film has less interest, since most references will be lost, but will still offer a good trace of reflection on aging, acting, public life ...
