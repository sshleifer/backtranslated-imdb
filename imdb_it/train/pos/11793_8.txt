I'm looking at the series backwards as fast as possible. I'm trying to look at all the things in Star Trek. This is month 3 and I am now in the third season of TNG and have already switched to DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever made. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first recapitulated episode of the TNG series. Having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed that a couple of them were shot because the film looked better. The first season always seemed really dark and ugly - and the actors seemed silly, as if they didn't fit their skins. <br /> <br /> The show is essentially made only of great successes of the happiest and the saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise up to this point. The Data and Riker scene on the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the second Klingon ship's officer defies Riker's authority as first officer and Riker beat the living CRAP from that Klingon. Then the admiral gives him a good $$. The whole episode is a real reminder to the fact that MANY great things have already happened in just 2 seasons with 5 more and a handful of films! At this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that bind Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Up to this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it. Let the disc show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha states that Imzadi means "first" and denotes that you have had intimate relationships with Riker and remains deeply close to the emotional one. This episode further shows that there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this point in the series, the value of production is at speed and Star Trek TNG is settling in the giant of science fiction that was destined to become. Looking at him again as an adult, I now see what GREAT ACTORS the Star Trek universe offers. They really need to create a new set of ST shows after all the shows in progress. A DS9 movie would have been nice too.
