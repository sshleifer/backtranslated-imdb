Beautiful image of a man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to hit the lady, why not leave her behind and let the cops try to understand whodunnit? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths you should be concerned about staying closed. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit in a chair or say a word? Are there really cops out there who are wise, cracking, gum popping, grinning monkeys that come close to a suspect in such a casual way? Probably this played well before the wheel was invented, but today it is so unbearable and unbelievable. Capture Elisha Cook's manic break; his frantic pounding never matched the recording once. His crazy facial expressions compensated for the synchronization of the out-of-bound stick.
