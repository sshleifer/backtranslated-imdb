This film was a pretty funny comedy about Murphy's law applied to home ownership and construction. If a film like this were made today, no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. Since it was set in the "simplest" 40s, we get what should be a typical family of the time. Grant naturally combines the comic and dramatic elements perfectly and works with a more than competent cast, highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their scams make a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
