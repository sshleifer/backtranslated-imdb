French production in which the main directors of 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films that convey their reflections on the events of September 11th. <br /> <br /> The segments of the film vary greatly in content and quality. Two allude to US complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on 11 September 1973, represented in the segment by the British Ken Loach, and in Palestine by the Israelis supported by the United States, shown in the segment by the Egyptian director Youssef Chahine ). Two others recall other destructive acts (a Palestinian suicide attack in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan, the Japanese "holy war" against the west in World War II, by Shohei Imamura). <br /> <br /> Ironics abound in different stories. The shadows that obscure the apartment of an old man mourning in New York suddenly disappear when the towers of the World Trade teleport to the ground in the piece by Sean Penn, bringing the man to the momentary joy. But in this bright light he finally manages to see that his wife has really gone. In the film of Mira Nair, based on a real accident, a missing young man, also in New York City, son of a Pakistani family, is presumed to be a fugitive terrorist, but later proves to be a hero who sacrificed himself by seeking to save the others in the towers. <br /> <br /> There are poignant moments scattered everywhere. Loach quoted Saint Augustine, his exiled Chilean man, who said hope is made of anger and courage: anger at how things stand, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren, exiled to Iran, trying to tell them about the events that have just emerged in New York. But they are understandably more affected by an important event in their refugee camp, where two men fell into a deep well, one killed, the other with a broken leg. This is an understandable tragedy on a large scale for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouedraogo, of Burkina Faso, creates a drama in which the son of a woman in difficulty discovers Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his friends to help capture the fugitive terrorist, in order to get the $ 25 million dollar reward. He tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans, because older people would simply waste money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute. <br /> <br /> It is the Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (creator of "Amores Perros") that provides the most powerful and chilling segment, one that, for the most part, shows only a darkened screen with audio tapes of songs and occasional voices and tonal sounds. Short visual flashes gradually allow us to see the bodies falling from the upper floors of the towers, and it occurs to us that the thuds are these bodies that hit the ground. The sequence ends with an elegiac orchestral music and a still shot, bearing a phrase shown only in Arabic, then with an added translation: "Does the light of God guide or blind us?"
