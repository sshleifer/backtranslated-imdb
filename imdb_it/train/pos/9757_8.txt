Richard Willaims is a god of animation. He was hindered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very irregular film with a very twisted plot, but some extraordinary moments of animation (like "Greedy" by Emery Hawkins). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made on a large screen so that the VHS won't show it in all its glory, let's hope one day on a DVD in letterbox format. It is still worth looking for an amazing animation.
