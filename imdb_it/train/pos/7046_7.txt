In War, Inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all the war-related activities we are currently doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you know the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas, you're already halfway to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack plays a businessman named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Turiquistan organizing a fair in the newly released country as a cover while waiting to have access to his latest goal. While he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marisa Tomei and chased by the over-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are presented with Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has plagued him ever since and the company assistant named Marsha Dillon who is actually performing the entire operation for him (and exhilaratingly played by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played adequately over the top, it's not always the moments you expect and the little touches often surprise you. All the principals are transformed into solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise he does a great job and does a lot to dissipate his Disney image. Tomei is fun but underestimated while the Cusack is practically in every scene they are in. To be honest, he is given good material. The screenwriters make a good script with enough turns and visual gags to make you chuckle to the predictable end. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that prevents me from classifying it higher while the plot turns and heads towards the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your broad and physical comedy, there probably isn't enough here to get you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like clever comedy and great satire, this is for you.
