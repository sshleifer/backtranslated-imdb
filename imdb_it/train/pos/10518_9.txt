Wrapped in beautiful English country backgrounds, Emma is a delightful package to enjoy for a dream holiday. <br /> <br /> Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a pretty and intelligent young woman who has just married her housekeeper - and confidant - at a wedding that Emma takes credit for in matchmaking. Eager to use her talent in organizing things for the people around her, she decides to match the vicar, Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with her young friend, Harriet (Toni Collette). <br /> <br /> The result is a series of conflicting signals and misinterpretations that end up settling down, with Emma learning that she didn't have control over events as she thought. <br /> <br /> The film is full of wit and Jane Austen's ironic characterizations. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best, portraying this maiden of a sober society, educated with wit and ease. His growing love affair with the unparalleled Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic men starring in the movies. It's incredibly beautiful, in a modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. It is certainly well matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Their fascinating friendship, which began when she was 16 and she was a child, blossomed while he, a family friend, meets intelligence with her in a more fraternal way that becomes something more. With an ironic look or a sober jab on Emma, ​​Northam's Knightley is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Other wonderful features include the comedy Juliet Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker and the talkative spinster, Miss Bates, who is very funny. <br /> <br /> Seeming shorter and smoother than most of the adaptations of Jane Austin, Emma has a comic rhythm that promises real fun.
