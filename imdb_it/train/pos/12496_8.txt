For years we have watched all the horror films that come out, from the amazing Hollywood tires like Saw 2, to terrible indie versions that are completely unparalleled ... we suffer through all the bad movies in the hope of finding small jewels like "Dark Resti". <br /> <br /> We were able to see a screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005. The public loved it and I think it ended up winning the award for best film. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have the budget or the main power of studio films, it contains a serious punch in the disturbing atmosphere and in the category of fear. Acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worthy of note. The story and the characters develop at the right pace to provide some fantastic scary. <br /> <br /> Editing and fx visuals are also top notch. And while many horror films can't use music to their advantage, the soundtrack of "Dark Remains" only adds to its creepiness. <br /> <br /> I know the film was shown at many festivals, but nobody was close to me, so I can't wait to know when it will finally be released on DVD. Trust me, even if you're sick of the current state of horror movies, try it ... you won't regret it!
