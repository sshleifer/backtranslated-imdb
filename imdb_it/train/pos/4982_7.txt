I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! It is not possible to make a film like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. It's stupid and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. How come they made these kids "act" I'll never know. I think they are precious and that children make me laugh, but also the others who made this film, as evidenced by the naivety that existed in the early 1930s. You have to remember that this was when the film industry was very young, the stock market crashed, the world depression was starting and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you can watch movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents. It was a different time with a totally different mentality.
