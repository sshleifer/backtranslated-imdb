It's a pretty simple film, not very active but very fascinating. There were times when I can understand why Cher won the Oscar for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win by Fatal Attraction. However, Oscar and Golden Globe have won, and Cher was nominated for BAFTAs and plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low-income job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, since his mother is sick, so he means he has to have most of his family to attend the wedding as much as possible. The only problem is that when he finds the brother without hands of Johnny, Ronny (nominated for the Golden Globes Nicolas Cage), he starts having a relationship, and there the love continues in that lunar scene (where the title comes from). Even Oscar has nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning the Olympia Dukakis in the role of Rose Castorini and John Mahoney in the role of Perry. He ends up without marriage for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won the Oscar for Best Screenplay, the screenplay written directly for the screen, and was nominated for Best Director by Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Film, was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and was named Golden Globes for Best Film - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay. It was the number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Take it out!"), It was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!
