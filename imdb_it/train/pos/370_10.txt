I have seen this film at least fifty times and after having seen it last week for the first time in a long time, I still have FELT. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but it came alive thanks to the experience of Spielberg and fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia earned an Oscar nomination for his short but powerful portrait of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience every human emotion while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and got angry. Like most great movies, it was seen by the Academy with a series of nominations but no victories. But this film, without a doubt, is certainly one of the best films of all time.
