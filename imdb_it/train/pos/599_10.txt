I really enjoyed this film because there was a sincere sincerity in acting. The writing was first rate. James Arness is a great actor and showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times. <br /> <br /> While some may think the film was slow paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, a lot of boredom followed by a couple of hours of horrible terror. <br /> <br /> What struck me most about this film is that it made you think of a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. In this day and age where nobody stands for nothing, I found it refreshing. He thinks there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how much you may feel about the politics of the time.
