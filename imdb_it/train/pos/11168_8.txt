Collected from the real exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890 in New York, "The Bowery" is high-energy and good-natured. <br /> <br /> But beware: random racist epithets flow from the languages ​​of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper. The first shot could be surprising. This is true for the time it was set up and when it was created. And it also speaks of the diversity of the population in that neck of the woods. Definitely adds to the gritty atmosphere of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery as Connors is the thunder unleashed in the middle of the action, a saloon guardian with a high mouth with his firemen. And he has a weakness for Orphan Cooper. Raft like Brodie is Connors' aviator, the nicest rival in almost every effort. Brodie has never been able to refuse courage and attention, leading to a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still debated whether he actually skipped or used a dummy). Beery is the most extravagant ever with an accentuated Irish-American accent. It is simply the type of character to draw children, cats and women in need. This is probably the most rowdy character that Raft has ever played, and even goes so far as to dance a little (in addition to a leg show). And again the protagonist (the beautiful Fay Wray) is wrong for a prostitute. Cooper is as hard as one or the other, even if he has the possibility of lighting tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not the jump from the bridge but an unscrupulous surprise fight between Connors and Brodie that in the foreground seems like a real brawl among the principals. It is certain that someone has hurt more than one ego.
