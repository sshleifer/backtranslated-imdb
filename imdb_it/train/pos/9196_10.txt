Kimi wa Chest is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy in a box that is outside her apartment one day. He decides to take it home and arrange his cuts. Then he left a note to eat the food she had prepared and then go home because he had to go to work. When he returns home, however, he finds that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or a cousin. In desperation to let him leave, she tells him that if he had become his pet, then he could stay. And as a pet he says he would have no rights and will do everything he told him. (not that perverse way!) To his surprise he agrees and from that moment on he is known as Momo, his pet.
