OK, I don't really think Trailer Park Boys has any bad story lines, because they kick ass. I'm just ... in conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: Towards the end of the film, it shows Ricky and Julian telling Patrick Patrick to put the dog down and leave. Then in the end, it shows Ricky and Julian that they say they have been in prison for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip by Ricky and Julian yelling at "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series, presumably they were in prison for only 18 months. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, they give us the impression that the film's story line and the TV series plot are linked (due to the screaming scene among the boys). But some actors portray completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the film, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for extermination, and then plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the film, the boys snort coke instead of smoking hash. The fact is that, in reality, they never confirm that the two narrative lines are connected in any case, apart from the screaming scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to continue blabbing.
