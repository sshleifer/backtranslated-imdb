Claire Denis's debut is both brave and self-confident. In this depiction of life towards the end of the French colonialist Cameroon, he explores the relationships between men and women, in black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black servant "Prot√®e" as the main object of the film's desire and oppression, the film enters the taboo territory from the beginning. Denis builds an image of life through a series of character relationships that keep the viewer informed on the screen. The atmosphere of the film is captured perfectly by the work with the camera and (lack of) lighting. <br /> <br /> A great speech.
