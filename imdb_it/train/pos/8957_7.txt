I haven't seen this 1958 movie in a long time and I really enjoyed Kim Novak playing the role of Gil Holroyd who is a real witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a sorcerer brother named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian fixes her eyes on Shep Henderson, (James Stewart), engaged to a girl, she will marry; Gillian plays some magic spells with a cat and changes her mind about her desired bride and then becomes very lustful and falls in love with Gillian. The story says that a real witch can't fall in love, blush or cry and this starts to show a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie have decided that they have to do something about this situation. Great movie to watch over and over again and a great classic movie from 1958.
