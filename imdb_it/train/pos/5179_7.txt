Indian Summer is a hot and multi-character movie, which would make a nice afternoon movie (with a bit of editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past with a group of children who are shown moose, which perfectly defines the tone before entering the present, when a group of adults of the golden age of the camp is invited to new to spend a few weeks of vacation at the head of the field, Uncle Lou. The film thus allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp, and to form new memories in their last stay. <br /> <br /> The film is successful in the way it carries through its characters in this beautiful setting, and allows them to develop without having to worry about plot developments. Watching these people remember, and their relationships between them are what the film is all about and why it works so well. It never goes over the top and melodramatic, always maintaining its warmth, charm and realism. I've never seen a movie where nostalgia is captured so well, and I found myself attracted even though I had never been to one of these fields as a child. <br /> <br /> For a film with a warm and nostalgic character, I sincerely recommend it
