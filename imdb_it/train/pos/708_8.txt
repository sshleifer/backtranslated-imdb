An ok film about the low syndrome. One mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good, but has low. The mother does not believe that she can raise him, so she gives it to people who have 15 children and 11 have bass! Mom doesn't like this and she thinks she should be with her family (I agree too) so they take him to court and the family breaks up and the grandparents lose, he never really says if his mom is daughter? I think this movie is good but the plot is familiar, it's still good and it has some involuntary laughs!
