This movie is fantastic. Simply. It is rare to find a comedy with levels, and this is a damn example of this. When I saw this film for the first time, as the credit increased, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... "Did you just understand?" For those who doubt, look at the levels. Look at the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, the DNA! Watch the different characters, each driven by the position, and if you don't see anything else, see the connection between Vick's care and the path through the film. IT'S ALL IN THE HEAD OF VICK! The opening line on the world of Vick. The final scene with the camera that enters Vick's head, and inside, a whole universe! Completely quotable, wonderful cartoon gangster, handsome, handsome, handsome!
