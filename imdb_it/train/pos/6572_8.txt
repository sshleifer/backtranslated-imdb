One of my favorite films for a number of years has been "Last Action Hero"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to ruin my fun by becoming a politician corrupted by floggers; so now I can't stand any film where I can have a hand. <br /> <br /> The adventures of Jake Speed ​​actually play with some themes similar to those of Last ... Hero; so I was happy to find it on DVD, so I could see these themes played so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot-within-the-plot" involving white slavery during the civil war of an African nation, this is not an action movie. The plot of the "plot within the plot" is actually a question that the film has no intention of solving: Jake Speed ​​is a real person who is helping the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader; or is it actually a fictional character (which means that heroin has somehow entered the universe that exists only in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest that this is not all that is clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of it. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the public can desire from such a universe of "adventure". This is actually a rich theme, whose heaviness is lightened by the film's amiable and captivating sense of humor. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses in the film - first and foremost is the cinematography, which makes the movie look like a TV show. And sometimes the rhythm collapses. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live, no matter how silly. And I find the idea that this adventure actually takes place in a novel fascinating. <br /> <br /> Keeps you under multiple visions -m good show!
