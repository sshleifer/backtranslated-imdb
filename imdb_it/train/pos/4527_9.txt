One of the ten best comedies ever <br /> <br /> It sounds like such a joyous and light comedy that sings. Keaton's plays are - intimately, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, think. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully fun, deliberately delicious and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a top ten comedies draft if you were to sketch one. A triple love story will enchant the spectators; I want to take this approach here ?? Is Keaton's comedy like the DESTINY of Lang's upside ?? down ?? or Ã€ REBOURS. Still a couple crosses the waters of time and epoch in the Stone Age, in Rome and at the time of Keaton in a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in both films: one, a sad, disturbing melodrama; - the other, a light and virtuoso comedy. A Keaton is essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with Lang. The child desired by both Buster and Beery is cute. I found TRE TREE well written and intelligent, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is basically very POPEYE ?? such as ?? the child is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivals ?? Keaton and Beery. <br /> <br /> Keaton's film is simply enormously likeable, and perhaps one would be tempted to say that this sounds like ambitious fun, but it is not, but it is very funny, fun and very funny. And Wallace Beery makes a nice nemesis.
