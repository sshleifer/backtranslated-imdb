I like films that don't provide the typical "happy ending", and that's the main reason why I like this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after an anonymous phone call to the Thai authorities. The film does a good job of keeping viewers guessing whether (or which) girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim performs exceptionally well as her kindest and most generous wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls had been more abused in the prison, as suggested by another commentator, since I heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. Where this film grabs me, however, is its end. Alice undergoes a 96-year sentence in total so that Darlene can be forgiven, and we (the spectators) understand that they are both innocent. Every film that challenges my expectation of the final wins extra points with me, and this well-acted drama is certainly worthwhile.
