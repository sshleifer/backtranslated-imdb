Kiera Nightly went directly from the P & P set to this action movie ... she couldn't have chosen to redo her image in a more dramatic way. A big hit in Love Actually and, like Lizie in the Jane Austen classic, is, once again, "having it". Just as his woman dressed in a bikini at King Arthur was more skin than muscle, it is hard to imagine this delicate frame that opposes a bounty hunter's life ... but then that's exactly what Domino Harvey did (the real one ), and I (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) think he takes away himself. <br /> <br /> Things .... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the Beverly Hills postal code in Los Angeles, where all the movie stars live. * The most famous film by Domino Harvey was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in his bathroom before the film was released in June 2005, after being arrested for drug dealing. He had just completed the negotiation for part of his music to be included in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to the sexuality of Domino Harvey in the interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this film a bit exaggerated, then take a look at Domino Harvey, since the facts are more surprising than fiction.
