I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of "Death Trap" in a top 5 of the best stadium adaptations to films of all time: Caine and Reeves (an undervalued actor who has never had the chance to do more than fighters and "Superman") have a great time here. Even Dyan Cannon - who normally doesn't interest me - is played perfectly in a role that exploits his annoying value as an actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the comparison between "Deathtrap" and "Sleuth" - another brilliant stage adaptation with Michael Caine - is valid, or even right. Yes, the two stories have a lot in common, but "Sleuth" is as much about class war as the battle of the spirits, and the house of "Sleuth" is set at least as much in the film as the two actors - the house has no equivalent in "Deathtrap". "It's not so much a battle of ingenuity as it is a vignette focused on how people are not damn good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. I'll just say that both films are superb examples of the genre and are worth your time and money. This is America, after all. You don't have to choose! <br /> <br /> I won't give away the plot twists, but I don't think it matters anyway. nine times in a dozen years, and I still enjoyed the mediocre and scary chemistry, times and moments when things are "all pear-shaped". It's all done so well that the journey becomes more important than the actual destination. Anyone who loves black comedy and the suspense in Hitchcock's cinematic style will probably enjoy immensely "Deathtrap".
