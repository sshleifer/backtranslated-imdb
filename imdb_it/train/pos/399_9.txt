This film is very beautiful. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love it. This film is the lord of the Asian rings: a fantasy story based on current Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this film plotless, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this should be your own alley. This film is still very difficult to find in the United States, although it was purchased for distribution in the United States along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. It is worth the search !!! This DVD is also worthy of owning.
