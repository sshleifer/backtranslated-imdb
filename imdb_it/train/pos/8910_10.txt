Most of the Atomic Age monster movies that I saw on television as a kid - and some of them, including The Blobs, frightened the lights of day. Movies like INVADERS FROM MARS have made it all too clear to us "small fry" that the boys did not deserve trust when it came to things like things that invaded the home planet; THE BLOB has just reiterated this fact. I remember with fondness the late evenings spent lying on the floor while Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs guards penetrated an unsuspecting society. There was a summer in the early 1980s when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran an Atomic Age classic every weekend. These were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and THE BLOB's "color" print had vanished in a faint pink ... but, man, it was fun. I dragged my mother, and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It was there, in that science museum, that I fell in love with THE BLOB. The intention of the director was, of course, to earn money, but it was the sincerity of all those involved, from the directors to the "talent" (the players), that made me fall in love with this film. Trivial? You bet. Cheesy? They have no cheesier. But, man, what a movie!
