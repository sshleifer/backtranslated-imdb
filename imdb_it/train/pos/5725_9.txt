This is what I wrote to some friends before: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, honestly, one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! I'm getting very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (I can't wait for Boogeyman to come!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared sitting in the dark of the theater and I wanted to have someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the Grudge star. Myself.) , there were many jumping scenes that were NOT planned! I felt foolish but my nerves didn't matter to me! I was at the edge of the whole movie, with headlines, and the music was incredibly scary. I keep thinking about that sound though, and I DON'T LIKE IT! <br /> <br /> Actually I panted loudly a few times, and shouted "oh" in a scene !! Oh yes, I even covered my eyes halfway a couple of times! Word to the wise, though: I thought some scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought that whoever wrote it was sick and psychopathic, but I don't remember the movie, so I can't compare. <br /> <br /> I can't say I "enjoyed" this b / c movie I was terrified, but it was very very beautiful and scary. The final scene, too ... whoa! For a 32-year-old mother, I think I might have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. Please get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a slash flick as I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a ghostly film most of the time. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this film were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
