Extraordinarily fun vintage piece set in the 1930s, it is a spin from the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", made only with a low budget and much more campers by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes deserve a liberal amount of Gothic art, preceding Batman by two decades. Played by Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfect cast hero and by the splendid Pamela Hensley as the local Latin Mona who clings to our hero in a gold hunt in the non-existent Latin American country of Hidalgo. The best line, our hero for Mona, with a punch to the chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and hug him: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's ham and cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Expect a bit of "Raiders ..", a hint of "Batman", a small "The Lost World", a small "Lost Horizons" and a lot of campiness and you got it right. Pay attention to the cult cult Michael Berryman in a small part as an undertaker and enjoy the campy use of the patriotic music of John Philip Sousa. An ideal candidate for DVD publishing, it's definitely late. An unmissable gift for the whole family. 9/10
