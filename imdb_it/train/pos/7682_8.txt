Holly addresses the issue of child sexual exploitation that is spreading all over the world (about 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation: a daunting task that the Priority Films team does with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film with newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring to screen what is common to people in the infamous k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Even if he faces a heavy topic, the film holds up moments of laughter and hopes as we get to know the characters up close, keeping the two-hour movie from one too difficult to watch. I'm glad a film like this is bringing the problem to the world. Child prostitution must be stopped and this is an excellent first step. IT'S GREAT and an ALL movie must see.
