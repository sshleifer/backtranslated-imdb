Reign Over Me (titled after the song who) is a film that will surely bring a tear to everyone's eyes. It was the moving story of a boy (sandler) who lost his family in the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Years later he comes across an old college roommate (cheadle) he doesn't even recognize because of the post-dramatic stress resulting from the loss of his family. The two rekindle their old friendship and the character of Cheadle, Johnson, realizes that he must recover the character of Sandler, Fineman, before it is too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first film that made me cry in a long time. It's totally worth watching and after seeing it, I'm sure the viewer will appreciate his family much more.
