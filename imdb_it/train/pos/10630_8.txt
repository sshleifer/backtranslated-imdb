I think unfortunately the main comments on this film include the words "absurd nonsense and nonsense". I think it's a very funny movie and excellent entertainment. We must suspend the disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman can fall in love, have a child and live happily ever after together. But it is always wonderful to see it interpreted in a film and warm the heart. Is it so impossible? There are much more implausible events described in other films. The acting is good, the script is fun. The only negative comment is that the story could be over when the family moves away from its initial home instead of extending to explore if man retains some residual homosexuality.
