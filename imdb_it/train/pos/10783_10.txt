I liked this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith for centuries and felt that it suited this role perfectly. I associated it with comedy but I'm glad to see that it is versatile. <br /> <br /> I wasn't worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" might not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of everything - phobias and neuroses, and these can take a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. It is clearly sensitive to extra-sensory powers, as understood by local Indians, but not by any Anglo-Saxon. Not surprisingly, this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although this is considered a light "family film", it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Furthermore, Hiram's turnaround was a pleasant surprise for me in the end and he tied all the previous action into a bundle. It is fun to contemplate the possibility of such a spiritual guide.
