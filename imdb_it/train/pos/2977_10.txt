There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can't I really do it? This film is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I'm serious. Don't watch this movie if you are easily offended by bad words, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman, and this may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all the other debuts, I think Baseketball is the winner of the award. I'm laughing now just thinking of some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the film!! This is all I will say. It's kind of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a bad word on almost every line that comes out of their mouth when they talk. So I'm keeping it professional. The best film. Heck, yes !!
