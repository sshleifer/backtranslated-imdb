This film is really a mixture. On the one hand, the plot and the concept of the film are really good, tense and have beautiful twists. But on the other hand, everything is said to be very slow, without style and uninvolved. However I consider "Just Cause" as an above-average thriller simply because of the beautiful cast. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery was skeptical of his role. I mean, it's not that credible as the main "hero" and father of a young daughter (played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson by the way) and husband of Kate Capshaw. I feel he was just too old for the role to be really credible. However Sean Connerey is obviously a great actor and this is the only reason he is still able to bring the film as good as he is. But of course he is helped by a very solid support cast composed of actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All the actors are really good, but some are very underused at the same time, which is a real shame, as well as a lost opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is simply fantastic in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. It's really chilling and acts superbly. Normally he doesn't play this ruthless and chilling role in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this movie. His performance alone is already more than enough to watch this movie. However due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formidable, none of the characters in the film worked well because it seems too far away. <br /> <br /> It's really the way to tell stories that kills the whole film its great potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film with little style and keeps the rhythm sometimes too low. For this reason, we as spectators are never really involved in the story or in any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad, because "Just Cause" had more than enough potential. A refined cast and a smooth story with some unexpected twists in which nothing is what it seems. The cast and the story are the only reason why this film is still an above-average thriller, which will probably still please the genre fan. However, it is an eternal sin that the film lacks its narrative and narrative style, otherwise this film could have been a true classic of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
