I really enjoyed The Night Listener. It is one of the best films of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams offers one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everyone played the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is as big as her mother and never goes into the background. All are very credible. <br /> <br /> It is a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images have been cut from the film. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and did it directly, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think that their job is to impress the audience rather that tell a story and tell it well. <br /> <br /> Don't be crazy about previews and advertisements. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you expect Hitchcock to be expected, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film was the end. The director could have left a little more to the public's imagination, but this is a small quirk.
