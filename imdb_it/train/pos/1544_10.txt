This is an espionage thriller of the First World War, excellent but hard to find, in the inimitable Italian style of the 60s. From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory titles and the great soundtrack of Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the apocalyptic scenes of battle of no-man's land with poisonous gas and German cavalry in "gas trooper" equipped to test complete this is a movie not to be missed. It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of players inside and outside the battlefield. Apart from the battle scenes, some of the special and production effects are primitive, apparently because most of this film's budget was saved for battle scenes, but for movie lovers of the 1960s it shouldn't be a problem. I first saw this film on television many years ago and had the foresight to record it on VHS. I still have the tape and I enjoy watching it from time to time.
