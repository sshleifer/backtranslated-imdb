I grew up in this classic western series, and as a child I always considered it a pleasure to be able to stay up late on Sunday evening watching it. Bonanza is still traceable to infinity. <br /> <br /> The series tells the adventures of the Cartwright family, who live on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada, during the Civil War era. Their ranch (called Ponderosa) is run and defended by the widowed father, Ben, and his three unmarried sons, Adam, Hoss and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, who disappeared years before. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights are a hard-working, prosperous and honorable family, highly respected in those parts. The Ponderosa is large so reaching its ends requires a lot of riding. Furthermore, travel is often necessary to buy or sell cattle and so on. Needless to say, few of these excursions pass without incident. Though hospitable, much of the Cartwrights' energy needs to be spent protecting their ranch from intruders, or protecting themselves from citizens jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation. The Cartwright do a lot of shooting their cannons in the air and so, but they only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary. They are involved in various city affairs, including in the political life of the Nevada area. <br /> <br /> One of the main strengths of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and his three children, and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers. Now, a brother could beat another one every now and then, but generally he has a good reason to do it at that moment and his anger never lasts long! The characters are all very well designed. Ben is interpreted as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The eldest son, Adam, the most rational and kind of brothers, came out halfway through the series. The average brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy of the ladies. The younger one, Little Joe, is a charming hot-headed charmer who, on the contrary, has a nice way with women. This trio of brothers enjoys various love stories, but their love interests are generally eliminated at the end of the episode, otherwise the marriage turns out to be impossible, for any reason. <br /> <br /> The actors are all stellar in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and of course Lorne Greene as the patriarch of the family of princes, Ben . I also love the ranch cook, Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Yung. <br /> <br /> It is a western full of action with great values. The Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the villains are pretty evil. If only there were more programs like this western on TV these days!
