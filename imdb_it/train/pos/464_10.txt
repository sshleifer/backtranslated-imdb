I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, then I grew even more fascinated by her variety and skills in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this splendid portrait of a rich girl who rejects the breeding and the conventions in favor of the motherhood of the tortured soul of the son of a man clearly in need of motherhood. His eyes are the mirror of his soul - and what kind and beautiful eyes they are. <br /> <br /> Those who take things literally will find the poetic and allegorical direction of Marleen Gorris rather frustrating. Romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy, this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.
