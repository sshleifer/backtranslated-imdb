I went to this film after reading that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, which was turned into a monster by society. Suffice it to say that I was expecting something completely different from what I got. But it was a happy surprise. Both my friend and I thought that the film was very romantic (the fact that the male protagonist was not bad to see definitely helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes until the 3 part of the film, for now, the name of the other had the whole laugh of the film) to make you have fun and invest in history. So in short: it's not what I expected, but really a nice surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
