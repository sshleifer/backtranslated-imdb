As an amateur historian of World War II / Nazi Germany, I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. I missed it when it was the first in 2003. I don't want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on historical inaccuracies. A better job could have been played by the charming Hitler. I also had a small problem with some of the casting choices, not so much for their acting, but for their appearances. Peter Stormare doesn't look much like Rohm, why didn't Babson like Hess wear a wig? And my biggest complaint ... it was always made of Hitler's amazing blue eyes, why didn't they let Carlyle wear blue contacts? As for the positives, I thought that the actors who played Goring and Drexler were pretty good. Once again, as long as the people watching this understand that this should be 1st entertainment, story 2 I don't think much harm will be done.
