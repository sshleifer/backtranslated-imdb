I've seen this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's fun. And it's pretty scary, but all in good fun. A woman kills her second husband but runs into a problem when a fled maniac in a ragged Santa Claus suit decides to pay her and her baby at that precise moment. Mary Traynor, which I seem to remember from SNL or some other television comedy, is the wicked wife, and Larry Drake plays the madman in Santa's squalid suit. I had forgotten that Father Christmas was played by Drake over the years. His Santa is an unstoppable force and quite scary at times. You can probably guess how Santa Claus finally enters the house. The episode is interpreted for laughter, but sometimes it can also be quite intense.
