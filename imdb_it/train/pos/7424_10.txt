I was 16 when I first saw the film, and it was always one of my favorites. Of course, there's no denying the attractiveness of Kristofferson in the film - HOW DOES IT GET THAT MAN ???????????? Sheesh. It still is. He is the bad boy that every woman secretly wants. His acting is impeccable. He played a drunk / drug addict only in the way someone who had really dealt with him could - and he did - finally get on the bandwagon in 1976, so it was all very real. <br /> <br /> The music is GREAT and even if in the following years I thought that Streisand was not in any way the right person for him in a physical sense, I think it is more a problem for male viewers than for women. We girls are simply looking at Kris - and of course the boys are looking at female interest - my husband can't watch the b / c movie of her - he doesn't like her appearance. But I made him sit through the red Ferrari scene on the road towards the end, so he could see how well he was - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with explosive music - you should having seen it on my 50 "plasma - WOW !!!! And finally, the transfer quality was GREAT - anamorphic and very clear widescreen with a very good color and very low noise except for the dark areas which is normal for everyone the movies.> <br /> With some good memories of my mother and I love this movie together, I bought a copy for her for Christmas, I wanted to see it with her last night. <br /> <br /> I Ho tried to follow the original with Judy Garland, but I imagine to see this first, I can't enter the previous era. Watching all the footage of the concert in the '76 version was very similar to what I was experiencing at the time. <br / > <br /> I'm working my way through the comment of St reisand, but she seems to speak only of herself and s ongs, so far she has just mentioned Kris or details on the scenes of the film. His voice sounds EXACTLY the same time then. <br /> <br /> Take a look, if you grew up in my own age (born in 1960) you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
