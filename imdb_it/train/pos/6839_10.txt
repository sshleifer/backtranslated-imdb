In what must be one of the coldest movies ever, a transvestite is killing people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. You can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and things like that. Michael Caine plays a very inspiring character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a rich bored woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can't really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you may never know just who you can trust. Also played by Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
