The sequel of Vincent Price to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that cemented his reputation as an icon of horror, revolves around a bitter ?? even if enterprising ?? showman. Although it is a remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains the superior effort; That being said, apart from some resilient comic relief, the obliged recourse to economic expedients (it was another three-dimensional showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever had happened to the missing purse that apparently appeared in a police station containing a severed head?), this offers more than enough Grand Guignol-type thrills and overall field value (the price is amassing in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating the missing-stars summoners who took advantage of his genius) for stand alone feet. Incidentally, does the involvement of the director Brahm here prove no coincidence? since the narrative incorporates elements of two horror titles (both played by Laird Cregar) that he previously directed as I LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young protagonists are played by Mary Murphy (as Price's naive assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (as his police police fiance), curiously, himself, would have taken the lead in a similar song, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966 ], which I acquired just in time to serve as an encore for this). An interesting sideline here is the adoption by the latter of a new technique of detection, fingerprinting, which is crucial in causing Price's downfall (in a predictable but rather embarrassing blazing climax) even if the his spouse's persistent espionage of amateur novelist has at least a lot to do with it in the long run! Looking at the star in a tailor-made role, does the film come out very funny ?? in particular at 73 compact minutes.
