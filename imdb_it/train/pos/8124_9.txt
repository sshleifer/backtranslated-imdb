Apart from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is the oldest science fiction film. While sometimes the film is a bit long-winded and the acting can be a bit wide, it's a fantastic film for two reasons. First of all, it is extremely original both in style and in content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films you can think of as something like this. Secondly, for his time, the special effects were absolutely incredible - using opaque paintings, models and huge casts to create incredible scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. Sure, you could sit down and beat the movie because, by today's standards, the effects are just so-so. But it must be understood that this was the state of the art when the film was released in 1936 and really had to amaze the public. In many respects, the sets are very reminiscent of the "modern cities" present at the 1939 WORLD'S FAIR. <br /> <br /> I think the film is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "are people really that stupid? destined for greatness? "The end result seems to be a bit of both! As is true! <br /> <br /> A final note: I've seen it twice on TV and recently on video. All three times the sound and print quality was superb, especially the sound. If this is available on a DVD, hopefully it will be much cleaner and will provide optional subtitles. As the sound of the video continued to cut, I really would have appreciated this!
