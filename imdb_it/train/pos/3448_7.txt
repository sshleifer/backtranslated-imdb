A documentary without a word loss ... always ... <br /> <br /> Suppose the narrative is more than a parody, let's say it's a commentary on Japanese society. And since the film has such a fast pace as an absurd documentary, constant puns, as quickly as possible, and poorly translated as it is ... in the current version of its festival screener seen tonight at Copenhagen Cinematek. .. it's still pretty fun. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and ONLY the real patient and the open mind, I'm talking to you about Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I think this is a movie for you. It is an intelligent film if you allow yourself to be conquered. <br /> <br /> Fairly beautiful, and quite kitschy, and a fairly Japanese sub-culture. And quite experimental. 2D static in a 3D world. All in all, Fun for those who want to see a Japanese film that parodies the culture of Japanese food. A thumb up if you want something completely different.
