This is a good movie, but it's not recommended if you don't like smart movies. These are two guys who want the world to go, and that's exactly what they get. The acting is great, the ending was not predictable and actually had a good story unlike most movies these days. People complain that the film is too simple or too boring. I think they should be limited to films like The Toxic Avenger (I really b movies) or Billy and Mandy's The Grim Adventures. One note: if you notice this, this has exactly the same actors as Cube except for four actors. Take it two notes: wait after the credits (trust me on this). Enjoy the movie.
