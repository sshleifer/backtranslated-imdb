I loved this movie. Not being an avid fan of Ed Wood Jr., I prefer to appreciate his "boundless enthusiasm" and recognize his flaws. His films are funny, but his personal story is tormented by pain. I was hoping, and was happy to discover, that this film should have understood his turbulent life, rather than merely praising it posthumously. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get are people who knew Ed Wood better to talk about him from all points of view, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Ed's. Let's deepen Ed's personal and professional life: from his novels, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends , to his enemies, and even to his film production. <br /> <br /> The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems to be made out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of the most theatrical films of 1996 would be disrespectful (a bit like wearing a more beautiful dress of the President). The production designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of intuition when combining each cast member with his own background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be thrilled to hear personal testimonies regarding Ed Wood's disputes, and newcomers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible-to-find gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood used to define people through their association with him (for better or for worse), to the point that a woman would go down in history as a "pool owner" for granting to him and his friends being baptized in his pool. This ability to define the inheritance of a person passes through universally, since the most surprising effect of the film is not only to give a rounded idea of ​​the man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a complete view of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having that cast member interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood has created between the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with a great sense of involvement. <br /> <br /> The title also alludes to the horror genre B-list, but in the end, we see that this is also a kindness. What begins as stories unrelated to random people ends with the conclusion that the whole cast will forever be woven into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that the story will bring into a haunting unity with Wood's legend. <br /> <br /> In many ways contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed into a single point of view. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing it that we can ever get. Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at the same time respectful, provocative, thoughtful, compelling, amusing, sad, kind and rewarding.
