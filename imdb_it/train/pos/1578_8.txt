Rosenstrasse is a moving story of courage in adversity. The Reichdeide women discover that their Jewish husbands have been locked up for deportation. An aristocrat disowned by his family, Lena Fischer, finds himself in the crowd as the sister of General Gudarian. But rank and privilege do not deserve special consideration. <br /> <br /> Neither service to the Reich as a female inmate whose husband is on the Ostfront will learn. In one of the film's most terrifying scenes, the guards take the wedding ring given by the soldier's husband. <br /> <br /> So that you think this is the typical German brutality that today in America Lady Bush imperiously orders the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of members of US services killed in action) because their presence is offensive . Too bad, unfortunately, it changed in the 60s from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, her eight-year-old daughter Ruth escapes capture. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena At the beginning Fischer is reluctant to accept Ruth by answering in a way that we consider typically German. Lena Fisher's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware of and opposed to the Holocaust, also warns Lena against it. but Lena chooses to embrace the idea with an American rebellion, even renaming it Ruth, the most Aryan name of Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse but Lena cries: what happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, sets off in search of her mother's past and meets the 90-year-old Lena under the pretext of writing a personal story of the war. I thought it was interesting that Hannah wanted to look at her family so much but never check her grandfather's fate, the last known for serving on Ostfront.
