Accidentally pressed, he was behind the movie box of what I thought of renting, I didn't find out until I got home, I looked at it anyway. Absolutely amazing! a wonderful film, and one of my three favorite favorites of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is fun and easy to follow, this could easily be messed up, but the actors and the director do a great job of keeping it together. <br /> <br /> The actors are fantastic, they show a wonderful character and they do a fantastic job. <br /> <br /> I have to find a copy somewhere ...........
