You've never seen anything like it. Once the coup begins, it's the most dazzling thriller you can ever see, even if you know the result. And it's all true, because it's a documentary - incredible. <br /> <br /> When it was over, it was on my list of the 10 best films of all time. <br /> <br /> Ignore the right-wing fanatics. Everyone I know who has seen this movie gives it a 4-star rating. Even if you're not interested in Venezuelan politics or politics, you'll find yourself nervous and - believe it - on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> It's a roller coaster ride.
