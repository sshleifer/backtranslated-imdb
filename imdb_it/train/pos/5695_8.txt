Some films manage to survive almost exclusively on originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to launch everything in an almost feverish tone, but without making it inconsistent. The speed of this thriller should not be chosen to cover a weak script, but rather to accurately reflect the drugged reality. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox is a very special way of working with his actors. Most of the characters are perpetually in danger and often because they are rather ugly characters. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a hustler, able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes only seems able to control the mind drastically weak. However, it is an extraordinary performance. Comparing him with Kilmer's more 'Hollywood' roles as in "The Saint" seems to prove to be much more comfortable in the gritty independent films. <br /> <br /> Actors are the main force that keep everyone together. There are several small interpretations that stand out, especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time alongside their male counterparts, but they're all fantastic. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a strange and surprising energy to their roles. <br /> <br /> I originally sent back to watch "Wonderland" because I thought it was a movie about a porn actor, in the most rigorous sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it literally has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is a mystery of murder, and as such - it's excellent. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
