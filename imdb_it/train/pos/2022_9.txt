The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sex-up. The things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. They thought the audience would be too stupid to understand if they didn't show it all out, right? In addition to this, this is of excellent quality. All the actors do wonderful work giving life to their characters. For shallow women out there, it's worth looking at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen, I would conveniently forget that I was still married as soon as I saw him on him ... <br /> <br /> A bit like a spoiler. The final scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
