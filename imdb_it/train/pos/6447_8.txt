A famous conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers what looks like a heart attack while he has finished conducting a concert. Suddenly, we watch him as he arrives in the small town he left years before. Since he came out so young and his name has changed, he helps give him a new personality. He bought the old school building where he intends to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he has left to be installed in his new home, but no, Daniel accepts the harsh winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local pastor, Stig, whose church has a small choir, is calling to see if he can interest Daniel to help, but the director doesn't want to go back to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The people of the city leave him alone. Makes an impression on Lena, who works in the local store where she picks up her food supplies. Gradually, he arrives and decides to get involved with the choir. Lena will eventually fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected. While they know him better, they come to accept him and make one of them. His new position does not make him dear to the woman who was in charge. The choir members are a heterogeneous group, but they realize the change that Daniel has had in the way they play different songs. The new song composed for Gabriella, an abused wife, has a great impact in her life and in that of her fellow singers. <br /> <br /> Daniele's ideas for the repertoire clash with those of Stig. The vicar suddenly begins to see Daniel in a new light; is a tormented man who loves to read pornographic magazines before making love with his wife, Siv. His ideas clash with the dogma, as Siv points out to him. Stig decides to put an end to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by dismissing him as head of the choir. <br /> <br /> The choir, who has been invited to participate in a competition, travels to Austria. Daniel, who has completely fallen for Lena, has the chance to show his feelings for her for the first time in his life when he begins to doubt their relationship. Daniel, who is late for his own concert, gets to hear them make extraordinary music even though he is not in their midst. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, the director of this hugely endearing film, shows he is the right man to direct it. The story involves the viewer from the beginning. Much of the film's success goes to the ensemble cast that was put together. William Nykvist, who plays the lead role, is the best excuse to watch the film. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, do a great job for Mr. Pollak. Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music you hear. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better by capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.
