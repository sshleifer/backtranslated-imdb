In the film by Christian Duguay, Hitler: The Rise of Evil, Hitler's early life and politics are shown in a positive way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration. It is quite natural that a Hollywood movie contains things like the main purpose of production is the income they will get from the movie. Although such errors may disappoint some members of the public who believe that everything should be done from the book, I believe most of them fit the rest of the film, making it more interesting. We must not forget that this film is not a documentary. Who cares why his dog is dead anyway. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure who gets very easily angry and is very passionate about his ideals. But he has not been described as a super-villain, but more like an ambitious politician. I think this is a nice perspective as the film is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this has made the film a bit objective. Yes, he was a bit crazy, and his methods were crude but he was still a human being and not a completely mad figure as portrayed in "Inglourious Basterds". I think it made the film more realistic even with some inaccuracies in historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history is well reflected by the spectators. Although the focus of the film was around Hitler, we also had the chance to see what is happening in the country following these actions through newspapers, discussions of people and songs in a Jewish cabaret. The company's reaction was also reflected in the film, but it was very limited. The struggles of the journalist Fritz Gerlich and the ironic comedies that take place in the cabaret are fun and interesting, but that was all. Mostly we only saw his followers whizzing through the streets and greeting him. <br /> <br /> Another thing that was missing in the film is the information on the origins of his hatred of Jews. At the beginning of the film, some ideas on this are given, but they were rather superficial. Suddenly it was a politician who is making speeches about the need to exterminate the Jews. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Hitler: The Rise of Evil cannot be considered an excellent film that everyone will like but is not entirely unsatisfactory. If you can stand directors who change history for money, it's an interesting film that reflects Hitler's personality effectively.
