I loved every moment of this beautiful film and I was intrigued by this painter I had never heard of before. So I decided to explore his life and work later. As expected, I discovered that the film was not exactly accurate historically. I was a bit stunned however by the very negative comments about the film due to this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a movie isn't and shouldn't be a biography (or a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. A director has the full right to use elements of reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it has brought many people (including some who now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
