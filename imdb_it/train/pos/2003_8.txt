The main problem of the first movie "Vampires" is that none of the characters was nice. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time he used a nice vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. Female vampire Una is definitely the coolest vampire from Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts like a slow-motion restaurant scene (because Carpenter didn't use it more?) This movie is not at all as good as it could have been. I was expecting to see strong vampires in action and at least one more durable choreographed fighting sequence (for example inside a city) and a little disappointed. While "Los Muertos" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it drags on some parts a little longer (although it is not as bad as the "Vampires"). Very similar to "Vampires", but the climax of this film towards the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of these may seem "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it certainly isn't. It's generally fun and ranks among the best voices of the genre. It is neither a non-original Dracula remake (like almost all vampire movies out there) nor an unintelligent action show like Blade II. I could simply use a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to see a third installment of Carpenter, but it probably won't happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING the end was too predictable. One should have gone away - this would have made the film quite unusual.
