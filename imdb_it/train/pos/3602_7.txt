While the story of a child in difficulty who turns to boxing for self-respect and anger management is certainly not a novelty, the story is given a twist at the moment when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. He can't stay away from fighting. At home her father is constantly putting her down. His brother trains boxing in a gym and one day, when she gets it, he decides that he also wants to train. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this a "Rocky with girls" I believe. But it is not at all about this. The story actually benefits a lot from the main character who is a girl rather than a boy. This way you can deal with more problems at the same time. First the problem of not being accepted because she is not a girl-girl, and then when she arrives at the boxing gym because she is a girl. It's also a story about how a purpose can change someone's life. How positive things can make you grow. I don't want this to look pretentious, because the film doesn't look pretentious at all, but what I'm saying is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very good in the lead. Too bad that now it's stuck in "typ toughing", because that's not really what he does in "Girlfight". Of course she's a boxer woman, but rather it's the most sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is basically your loser story with a twist, but it's exaggeratedly raised by Rodriguez "performance. I consider this 7/10.
