"The Kennel Murder Case" starts in a race and does not stop until the end. Everyone was right to kill the victim and several people tried. William Powell is as formidable as Philo Vance, a gentleman detective. Mary Astor is as refreshing as her niece putata who just wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy his heritage. This film is paired with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disc (or pick it up from your local library), do it. It's pure fun!
