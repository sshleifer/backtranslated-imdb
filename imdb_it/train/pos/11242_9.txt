Anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with the trends of English music of the late seventies, should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film, on the search for a young woman to make her mark in the world of music, perfectly captures the times, from manifest sexism, times of rough economy, social upheavals, to the change of pop culture, from rough punk to terribly fey and pretentious Futurism / New Romanticism. The music and fashion styles created every day in Britain at the end of the seventies are still rediscovered and recycled (there has been nothing new since 1980). This was a fantastic time, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story and analyzes the cultural landscape, and it does both very well.
