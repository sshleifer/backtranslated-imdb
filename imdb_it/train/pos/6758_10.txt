Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where One Ends, Another Begins <br /> <br /> This is a noir prototype film and, as such, quite perfect, both for the style and for the view contents. The settings of photography and night are of the highest quality (the director of photography Joseph LaShelle lets the drama startle one scene after another) and the close-ups on the faces of pure expressionism. I can only watch this type of film for images, even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But the acting is top notch here, and the plot presents what I consider the core of most film noir, the alienated male protagonist (who represents the many men who return home in a changed United States after the war and feeling lost themselves). In fact, not only is Dana Andrews really convincing as the restless, solitary detective has a small but important counterpart in the film, the first (first) husband of the protagonist, a decorated ex-GI who fell out of favor and alcohol. The fact that one man kills the other may have a monumental significance, in general - the regular boy who struggles for his inner problems for success while the soldier wearing a medal slips into an accidental death with a silver platter in head. The woman passes from one to the other - we assume that they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the film. Although this is pushing an interpretation of it after the fact, we can still see the path of a man with a psychological baggage that is dear to me through a crisis up to the highest kind of moral order - turning into a small crime just to the point in actually he managed to get away with it. <br /> <br /> This film belongs to Andrews. It sounds a much more discreet and moving type than what Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You could easily see both films side by side for a textbook comparison and contrast session. The fact that Andrews, as Detective Dixon, is morally fighting for all this, and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not, could explain why one man gets his girlfriend and the other doesn't. Gene Tierney brings out a kind of extremely nice, overwhelming, and ultimately conventional and "cute" woman - not just a desirable cartoon, but someone you want Dixon to really marry. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but it's quite effective in its game with types and clich√©s. The bit parts are kept snappy, the small details (like the portable craps table), the nice touches, far from the actors of the characters or the charm of gambling in Casablanca. But then, Curtiz's great film is iconic even in its details - it makes no effort to be subtle, real and penetrating, but instead is broad, memorable and stimulating. They come to the opposite ends of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their main men. Bogart is starting his active service, Dixon and the man Dixon killed, are over. Through, thoroughly, but not washed. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that many, perhaps most, film noirs have what you would call "happy" endings. Man surpasses his adversaries and transforms his inner self, and the viewer, then and now, understands how beautiful what he must feel.
