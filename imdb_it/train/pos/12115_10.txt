Another comment on this film made him lousy. Since the spoken images were so new - I think the script and the acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. He had not yet found his style that we expected. Yet it's nice to see it this way - still learning the trade. <br /> <br /> So many clich√©s have come from this film and it seems that this film has marked some paths for the next 70 years. My vote is to see it and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open your mind and maybe you are shocked by the disturbance of the characters in this image, since 1934 and how boring we consider the first part of the last century. I love it and hope you decide not to influence it from other negative comments and a note.
