I was looking at movie listings in my area on yahoo and saw a movie that had not been advertised. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in there. Having seen "Mad about you", I was not once a Paul Reiser fan. However, I'm a big fan of Peter Falk. So my spouse and I took the opportunity. We were both overwhelmed by this story. The beautiful scenery, the sincere acting and the sense of family and moral values ​​that are rarely seen in films and in today's world. Not that nasty sticky stuff, but real-life situations from real people. I must also say that Paul Reiser was excellent, although I will not look at "Crazy about you" yet. I don't know where this movie went. I heard it was published in a limited version. It should be shared with the world. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. M.
