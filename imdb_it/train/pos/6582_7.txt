Ok, so there is a front view of a Checker taxi, probably a 1930s model. It has large triangular shaped headlights. There is also a DeSoto taxi in this black and white, inspired by the characters, almost a musical love gone wrong. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is the look of the interiors of the 1940s rooms and the hotel's fashions and elevators. Hair styles, male and female are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, she could have grown up. There is a loft artist who would be the envy of every aspiring Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> If you look at this aspect of a fantastic plot of Casablanca or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. There is a nice story under the track model approach in this film. <br /> <br /> My DVD copy with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was nice but not up there with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. This was an RKO movie but it didn't have the nice aerial logo used by RKO. I liked Victor Mature in One Million, B.C., and Sampson and Delilah and especially in Violent Saturday. See if you can find it. It was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers called Fox Hunt or After The Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson continued to do Led Three Lives on TV in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature was offered the part of Sampson's father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. Apparently, he was asked if he would have had any trouble playing the part of the father since he was as famous as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I will play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
