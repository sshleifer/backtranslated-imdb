"Dangerous Offender" is the story of an apparently anti-social girl, and how it went like this. It is based on a true story and, although I was irritated by the depiction of a single note, that is to say always frowning, of the title character, and by the hard dedication of his lawyer, I am forced to accept that life imitates art, and there are people out there that way. <br /> <br /> The film is successful for me because, even if there is a bit of softening of the character's behavior until almost the end, it has gradually moved towards sympathy for her, like the film shows how it has reached its current state - which proves to be self-destructive rather than anti-social. <br /> <br /> Truly a moving film, which will bring you a lump in your throat when you think about it - which will happen often. <br /> <br /> Despite its many flaws, (including that it is difficult to look at, sometimes due to bodily functions and suicide attempts) this is another production that I am proud to call Canadian.
