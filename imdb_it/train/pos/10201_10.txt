It is a very beautiful film, not only for Lady Death comics fans, but also for those who like animated films / adventure and fantasy series. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl about to kill for something she hadn't done, but to be the one who is the daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> So look for revenge ... and the rest is better to see it from the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the film, the characters are like the original comics, they form Chaos. I've never had the chance to read the first parts of the story in the comics, only the last ones, after the film's passages, so I can't tell you if the events are exactly like comics, but ... in one way or another another is the story of Lady Death!
