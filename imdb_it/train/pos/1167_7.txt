Alain Delon makes a quick and sure revenge against the ruthless criminal family that employs him as a point man in the thriller Duccio Tessari "Big Guns" after accidentally killing his wife and son. Tessari and screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "A minute to pray, a second to die" and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" take this career musician to a career gunslinger for the crowd to the thread. In fact, "Big Guns" is quite predictable, but still qualifies as solid entertainment with a lot of savage and often sudden killings. Alain Delon of "The Godson" is aptly laconic as he methodically distributes death to the heads of mafia families who refuse to let him retire so that he can enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the ax with the character of Delon, but the rest of his hard-nosed associates want the dead man-dead. Like most detective stories in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" adheres to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. It is interesting to note that the only man who has nothing to do with the murder of his wife and the son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari does not waste a second on this 90 minute shooter. Apart from the mother and child who die in a car bomb intended for the father, the worst thing that happens is in a car depot when a partner of the hero is crushed in a broken car. Apparently, "Big Guns" is a rather bloodless tour, but it has a large number of people for a 1973 mobster melodrama. Only at the last minute does our protagonist lower his guard and therefore the invented morality of an eye for an eye remains intact . Tessari staged a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train crossing a railway tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn. Photography and compositions are excellent.
