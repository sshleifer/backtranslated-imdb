I was the first to be happy to see Jim Carrey in a movie where being over the top wasn't the goal. His character is like all of us. Want more - better things that will happen to us and expect God to bring. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us, but ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and sympathetic to Carry. the fundamentally egocentric anchorman TV wants to be but that's how it was written. I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what would happen before it happened. /> <br /> I have read a number of reviews and it seems that some people are looking a little too deeply. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world, even if there are some messages that we could all take to heart. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
