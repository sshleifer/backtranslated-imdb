There is a certain charm that I have always found in the discovery of the great (semi) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" in a junk mail store, mixed between an infinite number of dozens of different quality tapes. Of course, this is the only place I would find it, since it is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> While watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the course of this film, I was somehow certain she was looking at a great exhibition to be discovered. Yes, I had already seen Davis in several small parts and a starring role in "A Passage to India". But, although it was superb in the film above, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Recently watching Gillian Armstrong's next film, "Charlotte Gray", I was acutely aware of the kind of actress that impresses her. Davis recalls much more than a passing resemblance with Cate Blanchett - in both ways and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis's performance is staggering, I can't say enough good things about it. He shares an extraordinary on-screen relationship with the young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), the other great actress of this film. There is a lot of drama and silent humanity that they share, whose details I don't presume to reveal here (look at it for you!). There is too much stuff in "High Tide" to include in a review. Actually, I'm hardly interested in it - the film speaks quite well for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise screenwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors, and the great Russell Boyd for her brilliant, understated cinematography (please see her work in "Tender Mercies" ).
