This is a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a delight, bringing a strong comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the film, and his oily charm is well used here. Frank Morgan is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar way is well used here. I particularly liked the performance of Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. Very credible in every aspect of his role. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an exceptional job in portraying a woman a bit desperate, neurotic, but charming and attractive. <br /> <br /> This film belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action that revolves around him. Mr. Stewart is more than up to the task of bringing the film, with an extraordinary performance that uses a wide range of emotions. He looks at Stewart when he is fired from his job due to a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that such a traumatic event causes, so perfectly. In my opinion, James Stewart is, without a doubt, the greatest cinematographic actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else who has ever been caught in a film that is able to completely convey what it feels to the public. At the time when he made this film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely master of his craft. This is one of the best Jimmy Stewarts movies and also one of the sweetest and funniest romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this film, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
