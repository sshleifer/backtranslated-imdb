Shakespeare said that we are actors put on a big stage. But when this phase is Israel, the work we interpret is multiplied by ten and all the actions we do are full of a difficult style. Dan Katzir succeeds in making a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but furthermore, Katzir manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people and, these people, far from being mere prominent figures, speak to us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the crucial dark passage in which they live, and this marvelous country rises to light like a splendid bird that is born from its ashes. For me it is very big because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans know only for informational journals or for newspapers, appears to be a near and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people seeking their place, exploring the entire state, the whole culture with the sole purpose of feeling part of it. Katzir builds an absolutely wonderful documentary and shows that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with strength and these feelings run through our hearts. Thank you Dan for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
