"Most of us live at least two worlds, the real world in which we are at the mercy of circumstances and the inner world, the unconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr. Gone introduces to the inside the world of "The Maxx" a fascinating world in which fantasy and reality are combined. Inspired by the comics of Sam Kieth, "The Maxx" is very faithful to the material in what was inspired, not only in the plot but also in the graphic style, which resembles the pages of the comic, giving this show a surreal and unique look. But also, the story is interesting and fun. At times it may become strange, but when you're in it, it's hard to get out. The story and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music fits perfectly with the style of the show and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this was short lived. "The Maxx" is a must see. It is one of my favorites of all time.
