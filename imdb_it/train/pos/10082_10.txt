The film is truly moving, unique and uplifting. History is universal in that it is a battle between good, evil and the world in the middle. The most important thing is that his evaluation is wrong, misleading and a parody. Blockbuster evaluated it as if it were a film classified as X. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple subtitles.
