I also saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was fun, warm, moving and moving, as well as fun. A film like this would do very well with word of mouth. I would definitely tell my friends and my family to see this movie. We just hope they have the chance. I consider this film one of the best films I've seen in a year. It does not contain violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so obviously the distributors ask themselves whether to withdraw it or not. Believe me, there are people out there who would like to see a movie like this that has redeemed value, instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters that are usually given to us.
