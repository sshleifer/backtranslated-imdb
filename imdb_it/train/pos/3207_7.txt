Obviously, according to a normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is really a very poor film. Kurt Russell is a futuristic superhero raised from birth to kill, but then rendered obsolete after being defeated by a group of super soldiers in a ruck dangly that looks a bit like a Gladiator race without the mats. <br /> <br /> Abandoned on a rubbish planet, he became friends with a hippie community of space naff that teach him gardening, family life and, um, breast. Kurt doesn't talk much. Eventually the real super soldiers show up and kill the hippies by shooting them behind as they escape. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is added up. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy starts a new category for "Best Explosion", Soldier will not win any awards. However, however ridiculous, it remains a pleasant experience. Military hardware is the coolest since the Aliens (particularly the APCs) and, at 90 minutes, are not welcome by far. Please note that the following mark is only a guide. Defeat five points if you intend to take it seriously and discard one more if you don't like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
