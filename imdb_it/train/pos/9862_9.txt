Finally I could see the infamous "ice age". Apart from maybe not being as fun as I hoped after seeing the brilliant teaser there isn't a dirty word I can say about it. Of course, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production (also, it's Fox's first attempt at a complete CG movie), but it has a huge heart and on some occasions (like the look in Manfred's eyes after seeing the sad glimpse of his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the child with his father, I could no longer hold them. A film that has no problem walking on the thin line of sappy and clich√© and manages to bring more than the best; the end result is one of the most touching animated creations I've ever seen. Big, fun-looking characters that quickly grow on you (and great talents of the voice) and lots of fun and memorable scenes, especially from Scrat, make the movie more than enough reason to try. Also the Dodo scene, which is my favorite funny scene of 2002. <br /> <br /> I honestly don't understand, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will take over in the future. But if this only means that there will be more films like this (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I don't mind, at least for now. 9/10
