SERIES 1 <br /> <br /> As the UK looks forward to launching the two series of "Lost", series one (which has just finished showing here) has not disappointed. <br /> <br /> A group of over forty passengers struggle to cope with their plane crash - landed on a desert island. They pray for the rescue. However, as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest around them, they begin to wonder if they are alone. <br /> <br /> Of course, the series has difficulty keeping up with the explosive pilot episodes, which launch a polar bear, a giant beast and the possibility of others on the island. However, the series manages to recover after a few episodes and is exceptional for the final episode. Perhaps the best thing about "Lost" is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks. This gives us more information and, therefore, more suspense and excitement while the events take place in the present. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this show is a superb combination of drama, suspense and supernatural; it is very simply unmissable. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR SEASON 1 FOLLOW <br /> <br /> SERIES 2 <br /> <br /> After the cliffhanger that was the end of series 1 of "Lost", series 2 begins with our protagonists who deepen the heart of the phenomenon that is the hatching. They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do. Meanwhile, Michael and Sawyer are struggling to cope with the consequences of what happened on the raft. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, viewers will not be able to switch off the TV, as each episode of the series contains more twists than a Curly-Wurly chocolate bar, one of the which introduces an entire series of new characters. With every mystery solved with 'Lost', five brand new ones seem to come out of woodworking. After the 974 th shot of the series, he finally realizes to the spectator that in reality it doesn't matter if the survivors of the shipwreck did it outside the island. However, the surprising end of the series answers just over half of these questions, despite its anti-climatic ending.
