Like most other reviewers, I saw this film for the first time (on TV, never on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My father always considered this film highly and recommended it to me then, and I have to say that it was not right, but this film has remained with me forever for over two decades since I first saw it. I've seen it two or three times since then (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it hasn't lost any of its impact with time. It's still a beautiful film and worth seeing! Manr considers the RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY of Peckinpah as one of the first and best western westerns, which had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the LAST HUNT is certainly not the best film and it was also half a dozen years earlier . Actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time, or maybe it still is ... <br /> <br /> Although I seriously think and having certainly seen 100s of westerns (I like this genre) I can't remember any westerns gloomy and depressing like this. Two men bound together, partly from hatred, partly not seeming to have other choices, surrounded by the beautiful Mrs. Padget, an old cripple and a young Inian, who lead the life of buffalo killers until fate reaches out to one of their. <br /> <br /> No one who has ever seen this film will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem. When the camera moves and moves away from Mr. Taylor, a white buffalo skin appears in sight (on a tree) and echoes of the past, when all the hate has begun, are again present. Mr. Taylor has his buffalo, but the buffalo finally caught him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the best performances of all those involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it must also be said that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photographed, I have rarely seen a well shot western (apart from those directed by Anthony Mann, also all superbly photographed), that all places are chosen intelligently and that even the soundtrack adapts very well to the image. <br /> <br /> And director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller. He has made quite a few really fantastic films and has been successful in almost every imaginable genre, but even in such a prolific career like this, THE LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not his best. br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a higher rating, compared to the 7-something of RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.
