The main characters of this film are divided into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unfortunate drug addict who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to be repaid financially by his evil former boss, the situation escapes control. <br /> <br /> Standa is really stupid but at the same time captivating, his friend Ondrej is an absolute and whining idiot who messes everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa could have the chance to face life with a modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it certainly won't be without headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius who degenerates into a delirious tyrant of Hitler. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to protect Zdenek's secrets. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its share of superb entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky e 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you've seen the best of Czech cinema.
