I loved it, but I still have nightmares about the hotel manager. The film was presented well, with the choice of the actors who played their roles in the reality of writing. Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail. The progression of the situations was written intelligently, making me believe that the story was directed in a way only to find a new twist on what I thought could be obvious. Too bad there shouldn't be any commercials. I have told many friends to watch for other screenings and of course I'll look again. I enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigues. The heated arguments between husband and wife (or should I say quarrels?) Were very realistic. The initial situation is common but the escalation in the fortunately presented history is not. I want to thank everyone involved in this great entertainment movie. Thank you! Looking forward to the next movies --- when? Whidbey
