I really like this show. I can readily see how it has reached the state of worship. It is original and stimulating. However, for some reason, I never heard the kind of resonance I could have. It does not contain the type of open door, the winter cold that had to be had from such a magnificent premise. Every time I watch an episode, I find myself encouraging it, and pushing it to answer a question without a name, without form. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me tell you that the following is my opinion, and my only opinion Different tracks for different people. I would have liked to see more scenes in "American Gothic" that were shot at night. There is too much light in this show and I think it has a tendency to counteract the suspense. We are not afraid of daylight, after all. We are worried about what is in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we don't see is often the most terrifying. <br /> <br /> Second - and this is what will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is a tremendously talented actor ... a character actor. I followed his career with Brady Bunch movies, which is why it pains me to say that it was probably a mixture like Lucas Buck. It is almost too petroichan, too nice to be the embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotic. It's heroin. It's freebasing in a kitchen workshop next to a gallon of Drain-O. Keep going back, even if you know that the end will be madness and death. It should be like the last moneylender. He is a creator of books, but also of unspeakable condemnation. Sure. You have the money, and soon you will also have broken fingers; a severed hand, a decapitated head and, at the end, a damned soul. Turning to Buck is an act of desperation, and whenever it is around, there should be a final, environmental purpose - with aggravated interest every day - in the air. <br /> <br /> It's all generosity, all the strings attached, and when you understand it, you'll also know it's too late. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to three: they showed Buck a little too often. It is in most scenes, in fact, that he could have made him lose his advantage. The sheriff would be like the mythology next door. He is the apocryphal acquaintance. Many knew him, but only a few unfortunates really knew him. It would be the stuff of flashbacks and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to present this plot exposure would have been the replacement character played by Nick Searcy. <br /> <br /> Four, the show could be very self-reverential - to a defect, some might say - and this is characterized by the "Let's meet in the fishing hole" whistle in the series pilot. I think we've already established that Cassidy and Raimi were filming for anti-Andy Taylor. We probably didn't need the concept that was delivered to us through Fed Ex. I collected it in the first five minutes so for me, the plan on the head was useless. <br /> <br /> These remarks concern everything that, for me, would have made a great show exceptional. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup. In their timeless search for LCD programming, the network has played a decisive role in the disappearance of this series. <br /> <br /> The least that these jerk-off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order. <Br /> <br /> Get real. <br /> <br /> In both cases, it is a serious loss for both fans of the genre and occasional spectators.
