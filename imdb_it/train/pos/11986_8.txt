I saw 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was o.k, but I miss something. Perhaps Buster Keaton, strangely speaking, rejected me, or the forced birth of an important woman. The next day I kept thinking about the movie, anyway. I couldn't take out the song from Durante, I kept trying to remember Thelma Todd's first scene better, I thought that maybe Keaton made some funny falls and a physical comedy. The next night I saw a scene with Thelma Todd as a brave girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very funny scene, excellent actors, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. So I saw another scene, their show is opening on Broadway. Buster, in his blessed innocence, destroys every act. Once again, I was laughing out loud, appreciating Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: it's gorgeous! It's sensational! It's sublime! Three great comedians! Dance of Todd! During singing! Keaton speaks! Certainly not a problem ... but there are many laughs in this photo.
