I watch movies for a living, identifying those that are good enough to distribute ... Leaving aside those that don't make the cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on this, I'm just leading you to how I came to watch "The Gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies land on my desk and I actually sit down through all of them. Actually I don't "watch" everything, I usually watch TV occasionally while I'm working on the scan to get production value, performance and how well the story is presented. If something catches my attention, I'll take the time to watch it. "Lou" drew me in the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and took my chair on TV so I could tune in completely. Needless to say, I was fascinated with the whole film. The story is told well, the characters are captivating or repugnant (obviously depends on the intention of actor and director for the character) and all very well interpreted. I have occasionally encountered occasional amateur mistakes in camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes it easy to ignore these errors. I heard other people's comments saying that sometimes the film brought tears to the eyes, other moments of extreme excitement ... I was laughing a minute and I was crying the next day and I was incredibly touched by this movie. Unfortunately I was not able to acquire it because I was - as they say - a week late and a dollar less. This is the way it sometimes goes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing it and can't wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and good luck to you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are no doubt a talent to keep an eye on.
