The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories about the characters! Explaining just enough to stay excited! Obviously this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters that for some reason don't show up in the third season! Many of the characters have a decent expulsion but some of them simply aren't there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they'll come back in the next few episodes! But it's a bit inconsistent! That said, "Lost" manages to be electrifying every episode (especially the first two seasons)! This is a very difficult thing to do! I noticed that in the third season the focus is more on character development than on the mysterious aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It also saves some episodes from being boring! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end I'll want to see some mysteries to solve and close! The danger that "Lost" will be canceled due to the drop in ratings is near! And it would be devastating!
