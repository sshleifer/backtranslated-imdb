Disney did it again. Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life once again to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed it. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. Show how Timone lived with his family and other meerkats before leaving to find the home of his dreams and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they look for the house that Timon wants and repeatedly fail, which is fun since Timone gets more and more crazy. Then comes Simba and we see more of his childhood than we did in the two previous films. The rest, you already know.
