This first Anime movie was a pretty good movie that I caught on the Science Fiction channel once when Anime was really popular here in America and not the rating disaster that adult swim claims is in the cartoon network. I frankly think it has less to do with the fact that it is less popular and more with the fact that people would rather buy DVDs now, they are watching the uncut episodes on the internet. But this film didn't have all those cuts and the vocal work went well for a dubbed film, although I'd rather watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. This film features a guy who gets on a train called Galaxy Express in the hope that he can get to a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to be a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally killed at the hands of a robot that hunts humans for fun. In the course of his adventures he becomes a friend of the various workers on board the train and of a woman who looks like his dead mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who like most women in anime films has a secret that could really be good for our young hero, or really bad. He also goes from one planet to another while the train makes several stops and runs into a space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his animated cartoon series, so basically the Galaxy Express takes place in that universe . All in all a very good race with a rather strange and unexpected ending. There would have been a sequel to this, but it wasn't as good as this one, however the ending was a little more definitive than it was here.
