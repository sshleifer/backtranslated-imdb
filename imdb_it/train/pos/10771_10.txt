This film has a cast of famous actors, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, just to name a few, racing in Monte Carlo, as well as other beautiful European locations, and it's great fun. The problem is that everyone comes in when they lie to protect themselves, and I highly recommend seeing this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in great shape on Once Upon A Crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Each offers stellar performances, great acting, great comedy and great timing, which is rare in films these days. Great plot, great mystery (which I love anyway) and overall, it's worth it. So grab the kids, get some popcorn, juice or tea or soft drinks and enjoy the show !!!!
