I remember seeing this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. At the time I didn't really know humor, but this movie can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film. His performance is incredible - since he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are of the first order. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when he speaks to the Spanish-speaking boy at the reception: "No! No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Richard Benjamin, who played a straight man in Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a little old. <br /> <br /> no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original.
