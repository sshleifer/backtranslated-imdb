I barely remember this show, a little, but I remembered it was great! My older brother reminded me of the show recently and I saw an advertisement for the D.V.D set that came out. The net, once again messed up in pulling this from the sky, so that they could put what else in its place? At least 3 seasons should have passed. Why not, right? Sometimes I think the network executives think they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they are wrong and cannot give up the good placement of the shows from time to time. Let's say they have a lot more flops than "hits". This was one of the wrong decisions to be cut from the line-up. Anyway, I'm getting this for my collection.
