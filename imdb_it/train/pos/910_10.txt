It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya again in what is the best. A story woven around a wedding. It's nice to have a movie where there is no single scene that you will avoid looking at with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain new elements, you still like the film, due to the presentation, the performances and, in fact, the complete treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. The film is about the fact that engagement leads to love. The representation of changes in thinking, behaving once engaged is excellent. The director certainly thought a lot and the actors did it perfectly. Even if the film is slow, you don't mind, because you get so involved in the story that you want to keep watching the joy of this new engaged couple. As a typical RajShree material, it has many sentimental scenes that are highly likely to cause the viewer to cry (especially women). But when you leave the cinema you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
