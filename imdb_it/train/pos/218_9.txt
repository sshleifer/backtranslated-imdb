Taking roles played by Jack Albertson and Sam Levene on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play a couple of old vaudeville comics, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale that seem to have a different view of life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He is an old idiot babbler whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is finding less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him badly was that about 15 years ago his partner George Burns had decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau cannot understand him and take Burns' decision himself. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits a brainstorm, gathers the boys and does it on a national television special. What happens here is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is also a sad bittersweet story, as well as for old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the film, but it is Burns who got the acclaim in the form of an Oscar at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns has brought a bit of staff into this movie well. As we all know, he was the heterosexual of the wonderful Burns & Allen comedy that the Monty Python troop borrowed a lot. In 1958, due to health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George continued to go until he was 100 years old. Or at least close enough to an active artist. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is based on the Smith & Dale team anyway and if you like The Sunshine Boys I highly recommend seeing Two Tickets to Broadway to have a look at a couple of guys who were entertaining the American public at the end of the last century. The doctor draws what Matthau and Burns do directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll like The Sunshine Boys.
