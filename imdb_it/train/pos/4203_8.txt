This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast director has something unusual about his previous films: a cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley act in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to unravel secrets from America - and they will stop at nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters on a subway car watched by federal agents. They know that she is a ring in a long espionage chain. Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation - a small pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train and manages to steal the secrets that Peters is bringing. Widmark thinks it's just another purse he searched - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he stole. Now it's Widmark on its own - with Commies and the FBI far ahead on its trail. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is compelling from beginning to end. Even if you did not get top billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress may have had the performance of her stool life. She was rarely given this chance to act and was impressed by her ability to play a broken and sad old lady. <br /> <br /> As for the script and direction, I am very good - but with a small exception. At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It is one of the few times you will see a woman who has pierced a square in her mouth! Now it's difficult. Later, inexplicably, they become incredibly close - too close to be credible. Yet with such a big drama and a film as effective as the Noir, this can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
