It was a doubly interesting experience. For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the twentieth century had never been the central figure of a film *. The closest I can think of as a film with Einstein is CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR, where (as a "deus ex ma-china") the great man hears clarify a point about a radio quiz, so that Ronald Colman is shown to I gave the correct answer after all, and in BULLSHOT where the great Albert is one of a dozen important physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis from the villain, intent on stealing some of their machines. It is noteworthy that in these two cases, and in IQ, we are dealing with comedies. So far no one has tried to make a serious film about Einstein's life, like John Huston's attempt to make one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I imagine it is too difficult to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electromagnetic field theory in an exciting dialogue. But then, only three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer made a BEAUTIFUL MIND. Perhaps no one has ever tried it. <br /> <br /> (* Later, after writing this, I recalled the hit comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about ten years ago, but this is an exception and it was a parody.) <br /> <br /> The other surprise was the actor who plays the great Albert. It was Walter Matthau, here taking time away from the film series he did with Jack Lemmon in the last decade of their career. Matthau was a very talented and talented actor, both in comedy and in theater, but normally his comic characters were variants of his "Whiplash Willie" Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE. They were conniver and gonifs. Later they would lose their criminal propensities because we had become nice, but they remained grumpy types. But his Albert Einstein is genuinely sweet. More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke. <br /> <br /> He plays Albert as dear old uncle Albert. It appears that Einstein of Matthau is living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and is seeing a professor named James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs repairs and they take it to the car shop where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robbins falls in love with Ryan, who is attracted to him - but discovers that he lacks the mental equipment he admires. Good old Uncle Albert, aided by his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher and Gene Saks) decides to help Robbins and turn him into a seemingly unrecognized physics genius. This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan, provided that Ryan is impressed and Fry does not hurt things (as he hopes to do). <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is sweet, like when Matthau and his friend chums a super physics quiz that helps Robbins to cheat (by changing the positions of their bodies). The plot eventually leads to the lie that the brilliant Robbins built an atomic-propelled ship - which brings the interests of the nation into the figure of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis). <br /> <br /> It was a fascinating comedy, and an interesting trait for Matthau as he was not hyper as normal, but much more submissive.
