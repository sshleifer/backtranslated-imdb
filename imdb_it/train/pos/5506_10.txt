I can't understand why none of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" except for political reasons. No, the film has not investigated both sides of the story, but surely a film in favor of Chavez against propaganda tides against him should be seen as an attempt to balance narrative in general (especially given the story of A. of the CIA's involvement in Latin America in the fermentation of civil unrest - the national security archive of Google and B. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly falsified scenes of Chavez supporters who shot at non-existent opponents) The most surprising thing about this film is the fact that the directors stayed in the presidential palace all the time despite the coup - certainly a first documentary - images of a coup on both sides !!!
