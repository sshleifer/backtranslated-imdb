Ride With The Devil directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another jewel in this director's cap. For those unfamiliar with the history of the Kansas and Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. In addition to some superb action scenes (sometimes quite bloody). This is a story of love and devotion between men and a woman in particular. Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright is the protagonist and like the young Jewel woman, I've never heard or seen her before, I want to see more). The acting is top notch, superb production values, very well written (adapted from a novel) <br /> <br /> This is a 128 minute long movie, but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> my vote is **** <br /> <br /> presented respectively <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
