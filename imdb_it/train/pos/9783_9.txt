As one could say that Peaches, with its complex narrative that deals with a multitude of problems, is "a small television idea" is beyond me. Also, I can think of many movies that have "a little TV idea" in their plots. Your obvious dislike of the television industry ("Sue Smith failed to overcome her television background") is confusing. in particular because you are doing "a good time" working on TV. If only we could all be as talented as Ms Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - awarded by the AFI Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. All made for TV. Come to think of it, what about those "little television ideas" like "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "The Dismissal", "Scales of Justice", "Blue Murder", "Water under the Bridge", etc. . I think Peaches is a good funny movie that interested me, and also most of my friends, from beginning to end. It's far from flawless, but I think it's among the best Australian films I've seen in the last two years. Who knows, with a few more remarks (there's so much to think about), it might just be up there with classics like "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground". I really liked this movie a lot more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These films, I think, had their moments, surreal, atmospheric, realistic and that have to do with important contemporary issues, but as for pure entertainment for me and me, it was very normal if not boring. When I go to see a film, I am always aware of the public's reaction to a film (through in-film reactions and conversations heard in the foyer and the studio). Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads, some with negative criticism, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.
