This was a delightful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well interpreted by animation with vanity, arrogance, snobby superiority and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) that I remember vividly is when Hemo gets tired of "all this plumbing ... you haven't learned my secrets yet" and threatens to escape, the scientist answers him in one word "Thalassa" - salt water which horrifies the writer of fiction, but softens Hemo and insinuates itself so well into the chemical aspects of the blood. <br /> <br /> Such a wonderful mix of entertainment and information makes this classic as fresh and compelling today as the day it was published. Stimulating interest and imagination is essential to teach children to love learning.
