I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had nice twists and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" scored higher than average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were many cuts and verbal thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed screen. I could give numerous examples, but why should I? Watch the film. Second, this film has included a rarely recognized principle. For a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a credible villain. If you don't have one, there's not much joy in cheering for good guys. And "Rob Roy" doesn't have one, but three - the Earl of Montrose, his henchman Kilairn and Archie. Even the bad ones are not one-dimensional, but completely fleshy and very bad. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there's more dialogue, and the accents are a bit difficult, but it's a much smarter and subtler piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
