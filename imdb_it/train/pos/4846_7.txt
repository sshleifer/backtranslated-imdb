This is a classic British comic thriller that I always wanted to check out, but until then I had never had the chance to do it. It is based on a popular theatrical show that had already been filmed a number of times before (particularly in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version does not seem to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake under review, the plot was updated to the current wartime situation. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was mainly familiar with the first British comedians through the films of Will Hay: since this has a similar plot of legendary elves, contraband and enemy agents, it is very much in that vein (in reality was scripted by Hay's regular writing team of Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the element of stranded travelers, therefore, was an equally proven formula. The star this time is Arthur Askey (enchanted by Richard Murdoch) - none of whose films I have seen before - who is an unlikely hero like Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating ... but soon warms up to him, and Askey certainly has a number of jokes and amusing affairs to justify the fact that the main character of the drama (and the 1931 film version) was split in two here, with Murdoch acting as Star's Straight Partner. <br /> <br /> The single remote control (the film's events take place mostly during a stormy night) offers a wonderful atmosphere; the last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the owner vehicle itself - is particularly compelling and well managed. Worthy of mention also from the list of the remaining cast is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotyped scared spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement of taking her first drink.
