This film stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of an automobile engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to an emerging car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their collaboration. Meanwhile in the same cemetery where the Japanese had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was killed by the same men. Tony's friend was looking at the garbage can. <br /> <br /> Tony decides to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is stealing while obviously the murder should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese policeman and, by mistake, arrests him. Eventually they end up working together on the case. They make a strange pair and there are some really fun parts and some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita that jumps and kicks through the windshield of a moving car and kicks on Madras's head. But it ends up being a nice friend cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is nice in the role and Pat Morita is good too. However, I am one of the most unlikely cops in an action movie. If you like friendly cop movies, 80s movies and want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
