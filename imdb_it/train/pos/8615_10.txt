I waited for this movie to come out for a while in Canada, and when it finally did, I was very happy to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at the beginning, it is a very sad film (and it was New Year's Day - which makes it even sadder) - however, it remains true to you. The next day I was thinking of it again, because even if it revolves around something so excitingly emptying, after a few days you realize that it's such a beautiful story. As a person can be seen as connecting to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things. And the way Diane Keaton's character saves others just by staying there. And how they also save it in the process. It was an excellent film, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers the perfect comic relief. It's definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues, but it will really stay with you for a long time.
