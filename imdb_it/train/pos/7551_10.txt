The best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely stunning effects, but the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. History presents a family of cats, where in the older sister dies, the younger brother sees this and saves his body, but when he wakes up he is left without a soul. Thus, the two brothers cats take a journey to find him. I reported this trip to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I look at it I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so in his physiological appearance, you will still love him. The animation is superb and the creative scenes will complement the screen. For example, the ocean that freezes over time, the god who eats soup from the earth, a strange and slightly SNM that tells of Hansel and Gretel. To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute pleasure for anyone. <br /> <br /> PS - Not for children, including free violence.
