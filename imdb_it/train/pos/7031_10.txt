This is a great movie, I made the game some time ago. He had an extra zing ... for that. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey and Jason Alexander also has a beautiful voice. It was great too The setting was very good. Except that it's 2 hours and 50 minutes, it's quite long. Overall, I give it 8.5 stars. They also added some parts, but it was still nice.
