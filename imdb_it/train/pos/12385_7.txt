Friend, I love the new DVD that Universal has released. I have never seen THE SENTINEL so beautiful for years that I had to put up with poor and grainy VHS tapes. Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks much worse for wear. AND AVOID Goodtimes DVD at all costs. Yet it sucks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the fashionable fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to the busy brownish stone house in New York, only it's more than just haunted. It is also a portal to hell and the Vatican guards an old blind priest (John Carradine) to monitor it and make sure that the devils and archangels do not escape. <br /> <br /> This cast has a cast of famous actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as cameos from upcoming 80s stars, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (which is the voice was mysteriously overdubbed) and Tom Berenger. And you won't even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to do a double-take when I didn't have enough place to see it before. <br /> <br /> Beautiful gore scenes of Alison cutting the eye and nose from the decayed corpse of her late father who was possessed by the devil. And there is a neat finish where deformed and deformed people try to persecute Alison to commit suicide, so she won't be the next to protect the portal. It seems that Alison's tormented past makes her a leading candidate from the Vatican to become the next sentinel. <br /> <br /> An excellent, gruesome classic from the 70s by director Michael Winner, not to be missed. I also recommended it to those who want something a little more imaginative than the usual nonsense as a teenager and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 on 10 <br /> <br /> -
