I was about 12 when I saw this classic "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon. I thought it was one of the first since Casper did not seem * right *, in the same way that Porky Pig does not seem * okay * in the old 1930s cartoons. , this episode in the afterlife of his ghost friend worries him by making friends with a young fox of todd who calls Ferdie. I remember being happy to see Casper having a friend, as those who saw the cartoons used to know that most people flee from him, shouting "A Ghost!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have a little fun together until someone else shows up ... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the comic only has seven minutes, so you can't really be too ambiguous . Also, anyone who reads the film's synopsis from IMDb can deduce what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit harrowing. In fact, it's probably the saddest I've ever experienced looking at a cartoon. But that just means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Oh god, the fact that I actually remember this comic is due to its emotional effect on me - I haven't seen it since. But the cartoon ends on a positive note, and I was glad to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this comic to 8 out of 10 stars. Second only to the Warner Bros. comic "Peace on Earth", this is the most I've ever received from a short movie.
