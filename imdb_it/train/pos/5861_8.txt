Overall, I completely agree with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel that I shouldn't even comment because it's a veterinarian film and I'm not a vet (I was an expert). The flaw is that Martha is poorly underdeveloped and does not act consistently. My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian and he spent too little time planning his character.
