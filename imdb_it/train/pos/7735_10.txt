An excellent interpretation of the Jim Thompson novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements: the ex-mocked boxer became a vagabond, an alcoholic widow with sinister desires, the ex-policeman transformed a small swindler, and a kidnapping plot destined to ruin. However, the film never crosses the clich√©, but remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are all superb, in particular the role of Bruce Dern as the evil sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty about the movement of the film which, intentionally or not, adds to the sad process. Highly recommended.
