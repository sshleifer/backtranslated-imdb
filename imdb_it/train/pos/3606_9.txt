I really liked the fight against the girls. It's something I could see over and over again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. I could say very convincing. The film shows how women should defend what they want to do in life. He had so much compassion and yet so much hatred at the same time. Dealing with an ignorant dad hasn't really helped her much. Even though he loved her, he was really hateful. His mother died when he was younger and this also put some sadness in the role. The love story was a part that I really appreciated in the film too. I felt the passion for each other. Then again the drama starts and then it's like he's choosing between his boyfriend and his lifelong dream. I thought it was just right. It was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them. For all the people who like a movie based on a sport with a good story I suggest you check this
