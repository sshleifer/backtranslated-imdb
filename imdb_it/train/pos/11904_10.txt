I gave a 10, since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been scurrilous not to do it. The reason I'm worrying is to add a personal remark about Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I saw "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the intelligent color sequence in which everything but blood is black and white) a couple of times and "The House On Haunted Hill " many times. <br /> <br /> Even I am not old enough to see them when Castle was up to its showman tricks, so I can appreciate them for their merit. And while most pass it as second rate, schlocky, hammy, etc., I think they do him a bad job. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Homicidal" is shocking GENUINELY and works today - and the premise of "The Tingler" while stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. Having used that house of Frank Lloyd Wright as an exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid cast, as well as a good soundtrack and production values ​​- when I saw it for the first time in a late evening in the late 1960s, he produced a public reaction I hadn't seen it before and haven't seen it since. <br /> <br /> It was the point where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we're waiting to hear the hero from the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Without any telegram of what is coming, the camera slowly retreats, forcing the AUDIENCE to change the look on ... I'm saying no more (my "spoiler" declaration above) it only covers THIS film). <br /> <br /> The point is, I believe this ploy was DELIBERATED - not random - and when it happened, the WHOLE ENTIRE SCREAMED (including most men!). He took the audience to TEN MINUTES to calm down. <br /> <br /> Now THIS is a superior film production. A flamboyant showman that could have been, but "House" and the other two films I mentioned were GOOD MOVIES. Castle may not have been a Hitchcock, but it wasn't even Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It is easy to focus on someone's oddities and forget to examine their TALENT. So I hope this documentary has recognized it. I can not wait to see it.
