<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This film is one of the most entertaining films ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. His sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) arrives, telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His companion (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes their adventures in novels. This film is a great adventure. It's fun, it's full of action, it's just great. I imagine it is a cult film with a very small cult following. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws some one-liners you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also as good as the girl and the assistant, respectively. John Hurt, the guy who blows up his stomach in Alien, interprets the devilish perverted villain who just adds fun. In many ways, this film is similar to Indiana Jones, somehow similar to the James Bond movies. Maybe he should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title, it's a very funny movie.
