I was attracted to this movie when I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for an incoming boy. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a great success in Sweden. As a very provincial American I can only speculate on reason. Maybe it's because of the provocative joke that the character of Lena makes at the beginning of the film and other social comments, but maybe it's because of the central message that I believe has the same appeal everywhere in rich societies. <br /> <br /> The message of this film for me is the same as for the Titanic movie. Life is short and, as far as I know, is all we have. It can be taken away at any time. So isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind the walls that separate us from other people because we are so afraid of being hurt? Breaking down the walls is painful, but feeling alive is on the other side of those miserable walls. Feeling alive is worth the risk. Come on and you will receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for its lack of characterization and other flaws. I say you're all pseudo-sophisticated. Take part in the people, it's a parable, a fairy tale for us wealthy Westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> So join a choir or band or help build houses or distribute food for those less fortunate than you. Spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you go out and enter into communion with your neighbor. Writing a check is not enough. We are a social species, by the way. Even the humblest of your kind can influence you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Robust individualism has its place but is overrated.
