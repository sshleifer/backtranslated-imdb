Excellent pirate show! He has all the good ingredients to keep his attention - a compelling story of intrigue, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) attracted by the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is on a secret mission on his own. They make a nice romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the bad, bad pirate who weaves his infamous network of division and conquest. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role like Mrs MacGregor, the patroness of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There is a beautifully filmed scenery of coasts, ships and the bay. Lots of action including sword fights, naval battles, daring leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). From the same blazing red that I heard in an interview with Maureen O'Hara who boasted a great mastery of the whip and could even beat Flynn in sword fighting in those days, but there would have been no need to test him here. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie.
