In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels ill and leaves a poker game while the small criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance) wins. He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped into the sea. During the autopsy, the family man, the lieutenant commander, Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the American public health service, discovers that the dead man has a lung sore caused by mice and needs to find out who had any type of contact with the man within forty eight hours to avoid an epidemic The city mayor assigns to the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) the task of helping Dr. Clint find the killers infected by the plague and inoculate them. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story, but it is still effective and with a big villain. The engaging plot did not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance plays a despicable scum on his debut, and the camera works while trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the Streets")
