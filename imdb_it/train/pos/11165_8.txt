Four words explain why this film was made: "She Done Him Wrong". The enormous commercial success of Mae West's vehicle convinced the brass of the study that the Gay melodramas of the 1990s were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast and well-written game that carefully addresses the personalities of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little more difficult to take, but it is Fay Wray who steals the movie with his damsel stock in commerce in danger. With a strong director - as Walsh demonstrates - Wray could carry a lot of punch, and is absolutely credible as the subject of both the affection of Raft and Beery. <br /> <br /> So much atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten film worthy of awakening.
