Everyone does their part quite well in this "little nice movie". Belushi has the chance to live a part of his life in a different way, but ends up realizing that what he had would be just as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we don't have or can't have. If U could get this movie on video for about $ 10, it would be an investment!
