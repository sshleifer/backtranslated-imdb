I have not seen the restoration, nor any version with regard to, of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I got it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell, Lily lives in a speakeasy, has been exploited by her father since she was 14! Then he continues to explode and is killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone for his black maid Chico, played very well by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. It does it in style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a plump employee to enter the ground floor and proceeds to pass through men like disposable candy! One throws his girlfriend and kills his neighbor father-in-law, even Lily's father's sugar, then commits suicide! Lily just blinks! STanwyck is terrific as a girl who doesn't really know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris, he falls in love with Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he is in a deep financial situation, she bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, he realizes he loves Court! Lily runs to look for him, but will it be too late? <br /> <br /> This is pre-Hollywood code at its best. Stanwyck is extraordinary and the film's appearance and music are perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another film unjustly ignored with an amoral woman, those who don't like those ultra-romantic slant films, they won't like Baby FAce, those who believe in sex, in love and in power, I love it. Highly recommended! Watch it!
