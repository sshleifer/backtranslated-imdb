I was so excited to see this movie because I had always heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> What is interesting is that it is a Japanese film that they decided to bring to America, but in reality they shot Japan with the original crew! I think this made the film ... more Japanese (which is probably why it managed to have some success unlike most Japanese-American horror flops), but it also made it a bit inaccessible to the American public. The difference in what scares Japanese culture and what scares American culture is present in the film. This worked well at times when they intended to capture the main character's nervous fear: a scared fish in a large, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond. <br /> <br /> The plot was also quite confusing. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the center of the story and from there we constantly move back and forth until, at the end of the film, we see the end and the beginning of the whole story. This constant, passing through time, confused me a lot. Besides, I didn't think that some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel that apparently reveals more than history). <br /> <br /> In general, there is a lot to love for the American public, tons of bizarre images and macabre details that represent a healthy explosion of jumping scenes.
