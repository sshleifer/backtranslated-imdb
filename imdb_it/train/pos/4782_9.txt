Well, it's definitely different from anything else directed by Lynch. No supernatural stuff, no violence, no vulgarity. However, it is a beautiful film. It's a bit slow, but maybe it was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week trip (it's my best guess for its duration). The characters are ordinary people and therefore, they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly moving. Everyone who has a brother can identify him. Lyle and Alvin don't even need to say anything. For a moment they returned to the old days and all the fighting was forgotten.
