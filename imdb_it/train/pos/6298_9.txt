Great fun. I went with 8 friends for a preview of this movie. We came to see another one but after 10 minutes, wondering what the hell we were doing right now, the jokes have become fun and have remained fun throughout the film. In the first part you keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many other examples of this jargon) and because they keep repeating the same lines (with different twists) they become more fun and entertaining. In search of this malinski all the main characters are introduced, the first even more bizarre than the next. Until the middle of the film, we didn't even know the name of this film because there were no opening titles and we went to this brief observation, but we were certainly fine. The house was loaded (around 250 people) and I think half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange comic films with great dialogue, you will love it. In addition to Clooney, this film deserves much more than the 5.6 rating of the IMDB it has at the time of this writing, but when I saw more, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable, I guess, I would like to give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after some beers) <br /> <br />
