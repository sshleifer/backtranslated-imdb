I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I got older and realized that Full House could wait and I had "more important" things to do. In addition, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who looked at him faithfully with me for those two years, started to hate him thinking he was too "feminine". <br /> <br /> Then I realized that every afternoon at five o'clock it was 11pm and once again I became addicted to it. Full House made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mother. I've heard people say that Full House is poor and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and hurt their feelings. The three men who live with girls can get into barrel sometimes. What's more real than that? <br /> <br /> If anything the show raised me when I'm down and raised me even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I screamed like a hyena at the show and gained a huge obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Obviously Hilary Duff has now taken that place but they were literally the nicest children I've ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)
