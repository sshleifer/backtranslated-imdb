If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, the first boy / girl, or the first puppy to fall in love ... this movie is for you! OK, so this film would and will never win an MA Oscar as a Dominican, I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that could go right over your head if you're not part of the culture ... the kids grew up from a grandmother who is both mother and father, the youngest child is caressed and washed with a can of Bustelo coffee (sooo Dominican!), Judy is harassed by the neighborhood men, going to church and lighting a prayer candle ... the brilliance of the film was in those small details. Of course, it was not a cinematographic extravagance of all the works, but it was not destined to be NOR, it was thought to be an educational tool for those who want to learn Latin culture (advice: make new friends). More than a bitter-sweet, fake cumentery, this film has kept it real without taking itself too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", this was simply a story of a boy's growth. I recommend it (especially to Dominican!) = O)
