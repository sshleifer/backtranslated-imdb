The film "MacArthur" begins and ends with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata, the United States Military Academy at West Point on the Hudson. We see a fragile 82-year-old Gen. MacArthur give the start speech to the diplomatic class of 1962 on what honor it is to serve their country. The film then goes on a nearly two-hour flashback on Gen. MacArthur's brilliant and controversial career that begins in the early hours of World War II on the island of Corregidor, in the Philippines, besieged in the early spring of 1942. > He said to leave the island for Australia before the Japanese army invades him. Gen. MacArthur for the first time in his military career almost disobeys an order directed by his superior president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that MacArthur reluctantly leaves his men in their greatest hour of need, along with his wife and young son, he did what he was told only to have him tormented him by the reminder of the war. This was the reason, his flight under fire from the death or imprisonment of the Japanese, which prompted Gen. MacArthur to use all his influence to obtain FDR two years later to launch an important invasion of the Philippians, rather than on the island of Formosa, supports his promise to both the Filipino people and the thousands of US prisoners left behind. Who will come back and return with the strength of the US Army and Navy to support his commitment! <br /> <br /> In the two years since the Philippine islands were invaded, General MacArther struck the Japanese forces in the South Pafific in a series of brilliantly conceived wolf island battles that have isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops. The General suffered far less US military casualties than any other allied commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> In 1950/51, during the Korean War, General MacArthur won his most brilliant victory and his worst military defeat. After bypassing the advance of the North Korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed, with the US marines invaders who suffered fewer than 100 victims, invasion of Inchon Gen. MacArther invincible sent US / UN forces to its border command along the river Yalu, of communist red China. Said by his subordinates that he is facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Chinese Communist troops, General MacArthur put pressure on him until that attack materialized by cutting US and UN forces to the tapes. The unstoppable wave of Chinese troops that attacked Chinese troops forced US / UN forces to withdraw into the "Big Bug Out" of 1950 with their own lives, leaving all their equipment behind, across the Korean border of the North, even abandoning the capital of South Korea in Seoul! This turned out to be one of the greatest military disasters in US history, with US forces losing a record, in the Korean War, 1,000 lives on the very first day - November. 29/30 1950 - the Chinese communist invasion! <br /> <br /> Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, largely due to his own arrogance, it happened that MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advance of the Chinese communists and the Korean Nordic force but the his own commander and chief dean. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, doesn't have the courage or courage in him to do what needs to be done: launch a large-scale invasion of communist China with nuclear weapons, if necessary, to prevent his troops from invading the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman who had taken enough trash from Gen. MacArthur in him who was running in his mouth in public for how he was mistreating the war, not going all out, as MacArthur wanted him to do, against the red Chinese this was the last drop! On 11 April 1951 Pres. Truman, without too many ceremonies, relived General MacArthur from his command as supreme commander of US / UN forces in Korea! Pres. Even the courageous but very unpopular decision of Truman, not following MacArthur's total war strategy, prevented World War III from bursting with the ally of Soviet Communist China - which at the time - like the United States - had the atomic bomb! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to download the famous Gen. MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his polls so low - in the mid-1920s - that he retired, in March of that year, from the Campaign presidential election. ! <br /> <br /> In was the misfortune of General MacArthur to be around when political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality would have been national suicide to do everything, as General MacArthur wanted, against the Chinese Reds, with the possibility that it could touch a nuclear holocaust that it would have swallowed. only USSR and Red China but the whole world! It was that important reality of the future war that General MacArthur was never taught, since the A and H bomb had not yet been invented at West Point. <br /> <br /> In 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after finishing her opening speech at West Point, had become both an older and wiser soldier and from the time of her retirement from the army American, senior statesman in his feeling of war and the total futility of it. One thing that Gen. MacArthur taught at an early age, from the general father of the Civil War, Douglas MacArthur Sr, who has remained with him all his life is that for a soldier like him the war should be the last, not the first place to settle problems between nations. In this are the soldiers who must fight and die in it. It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for Gen. MacArthur to finally realize how right and wise it is that his father a winner of the Medal of Honor of Congress, like him, really is!
