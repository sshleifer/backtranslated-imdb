Each story includes premise, characters and conflicts. The characters who plan their own show promise triumph, and a militant character readily lends itself to this. The premise of Ardh Satya is summarized by the poem of the same name written by Dilip Chitre. The line says: "ek palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya?". A rough translation - "The delicate balance between right and wrong (commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts) has impotence on one plate and skill on another. Is the needle in the middle a half truth?" <Br /> <br /> The poem is played mid-way through Smita Patil's film at Om Puri at a restaurant. It has a profound impact on the protagonist and lays the foundation for many of the subsequent events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in the exact same situation described so appropriately in the poem. <br /> <br /> The film strongly strives to make a one-up on the poem. However, Chitre's words are too powerful and, at best, the film lives up to the poem in every respect. <br /> <br />
