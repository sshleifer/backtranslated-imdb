Interesting how much Brosnan's performance is much more realistic than that of the original James Bond novels compared to bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and a womanizer. It's a perfect break for him, if only to make fun of the bond icon. "I'm a disaster, a parody of myself," he says. There is nothing better. I have just finished reading Dr. No and this is very much how Ian Fleming played James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond because it suited the icon too much. There was nothing for him to personalize the character, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's nice to see Brosnan play a character both rooted in reality and massively off the wall. A superficial character who tries to come to an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has nothing to do. It's an impressive portrait, and having Greg Kinear on the ground is just poetic. This film reminds me of some dynamics established between the main characters in "My Blue Heaven", but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.
