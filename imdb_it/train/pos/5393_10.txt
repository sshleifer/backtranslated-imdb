I was probably one of the few Australians who didn't watch tennis when this series aired. I must say that when William McInnes first appeared, I think he is a lousy actor! But as the series continued, he attenuated his performance and I loved him totally. He was such a rotten guy but he made me laugh.

Seriously, Long's performance was a total and truly brilliant shock. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the lead actress staged a fun performance.
