To dig! I would say to anyone, even if you don't like Metallica seeing "a kind of monster", it's a "spinal tap" documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world that behaves like a mental boy during a crisis of sorts. It's fun and fascinating. Dig along the same lines! A film about "Dandy Warhol's" and "Brian Jonestown massacre" two groups from Portland that start a kind of music scene in their hometown just for one of the bands that will become huge and one that will fall by the wayside in the history of music books. From the beginning, the two bands move in opposite directions precisely on their ability to make decisions both good and bad. Shot for seven years and sometimes painful to see we see the fame of the dandy rise to fame (thanks to that vodaphone announcement!) And the fall of Jonestown by stage instigators to aspiring litigious. As the bands become more disconnected, friendships are strained and at various points collide in discussions and even in theatrical battles. All this is half funny and half tragic and believing it or not is perversely able to look. As I said at the beginning, you can watch the Metallica movie even if you're not interested in the band. To dig! on the other hand it is slightly different and is more pleasant and much easier to look at if you have a passing interest in both bands. Still a good movie and more a testament of not being in a band than encouraging it as a career path. To dig! It is a mad rush on the tails of the rock and roll coat and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.
