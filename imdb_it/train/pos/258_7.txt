Strait between San Francisco and Captains Brave two of the most important parts of Spencer Tracy is this very curious film about the war and its effects on some people. They gave him Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone are a couple of World War I disciples, Tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill into the training camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy still plays the lovely braggart, the youngest type of Wallace Beery that MGM had imagined for him when they signed him away from Fox. <br /> <br /> On the front Tone gets an opportunity and takes it when he is able to reach a church tower that peers at a German machine gun during a fight. He has learned to shoot now and is a sergeant York. But Alvin C. York has never been changed by the war in the way Tone has. <br /> <br /> Wounded in the fight Tonal defeats in a hospital with Gladys George looking for him. Tracy goes alone to visit her friend and he and George get something. Later, when Tracy is reported missing, Tone and George get married. Tracy is heartbroken when she returns and learns marriage, but sits down. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has to do with Tone applying the warfare he learned to the job of a gangster. He's a hit man now and George doesn't really know what he does for a living. I think you can understand the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that gave me some problems is that I can't believe Gladys George couldn't figure it out. She is a fashionable girl, her part is very similar to the one she played in The Roaring Twenties alongside James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, the development of the character of Humphrey Bogart is similar to that of Tone even though he was not the central character of the film. In fact there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> World War I battle sequences are well represented by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin shot this film, I think it's much better than he gave credit.
