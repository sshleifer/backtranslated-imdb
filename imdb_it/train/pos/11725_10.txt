I suck at Boob's free references, so I'll just write a flat review (no pun intended). I love Elvira, not in a "I'm-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical", but suffice it to say that I think she's taking a leap. The film is interpreted as a horror movie from the 50s only much more fun, look for the reference "Leasurely stroking of the ankle" to know what I mean. what transpires in the film is the absolute charm of Elvira (or should be Cassandra). I saw this film for the first time at the tender age of 8, and I've seen it in these contless time since ... I really should go around buying a copy, the video store version looks a little worse for the 'usury. If any other fan of the film wants to send me an e-mail about it, feel free. <br /> <br /> ps another great performance by Edie McClurg (parade of the cast), an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
