I really liked the first 2 seasons. because a lot of good characters disappeared later. like most shows are a bit slow at the beginning and then improve in the following seasons, but this is the absolute opposite. Jenny from the 1st season and Valarie from season 2 were Sabrina's friends, I didn't care much about the others, Jenny and Valarie were her nicer friends. I think for some reason, the producers wanted us not to like his college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode of season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode of season 2 is the trash witch, this is the funniest episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and she never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wish they had better things done. I also liked how the first 2 seasons, during the opening titles Sabrina would have said some words while wearing a costume, as in the pilot episode in which she is in the witch costume, I liked how she said "this is not me "and later she kept trying to change herself for something else is what I think, but this is a really interesting show. it's kind of like the awe griffith show in a way, because in the beginning it was nice, but once the color and the bartender took off, it was nicer. but I still like to watch it, but the only reason I look at subsequent seasons is because of the sabrina. what I meant by the opening sequence is: the opening titles of the seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror that poses with different costumes and different clothes while the names of the cast members flash rapidly at the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina would have said a kind of pun connected to the dress she was wearing, then disappeared. the opening sequence of the fourth season includes the characters in the bubbles. the headlines of seasons 5-7 present Sabrina at various locations around Boston
