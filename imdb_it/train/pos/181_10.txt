UC 0079, the one-year war is almost at an end. A neutral colony of Side 6 was targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon task force. Their goal, a new Gundam built exclusively for Newtypes (apparently built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside it. When the boy Al Izuruha, a Zeon MS fan, meets a Zaku after the battle broke out in the colony, he makes friends with the new MS pilot, Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Ciclope team. Through the show, Bernie acts like a paternal figure for Al (whose real father always works) and seems to be caught up with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but in the end they have to meet ... in battle. He soon learns that war is not child's play and that Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For just 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well-made show. The mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may seem dated, but it really shows emotion in the characters. If you liked 0083 then check this, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look at a drama and character development show, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that battle for mobile suit. I would rate it more than a drama than an action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
