Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the great directors of the world. This sensitive and visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well the dark irony of the writer. John Turturro gives what I consider his best performance (usually I'm not his fan); and also Emily Watson is brilliant. Worth seeing.
