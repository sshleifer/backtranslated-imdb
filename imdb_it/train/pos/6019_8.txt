ZP is deeply tied to that youthful dream represented by the hippie movement. The college debate at the beginning of the film affirms the cultural situation that gives rise to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that enormous transformation that society is going through and in the end Marco's death anticipates the goal that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more easily understood if we return to that moment in life. During the 1960s and 1970s, young people were the driving force behind the profound explorations of change. One of the most significant changes was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think that the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would exhibit in the hypothetical situation where there would be no one to to hide in. I saw the scene in which couples threw sand and appreciated the magnificent way in which A depicted the impossibility of continuing to hide this fundamental human instinct. Repression was the way to "control" social explosions at that time and this is the method, the police apply to stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and this is clear when students have access to weapons by skipping all false checks. The dialogue between the policeman and the university professor, who is detained for no reason, shows part of the society interested in this youthful feeling and part of it completely disinterested. Presenting the flight as the most accurate symbol for freedom, theft of the plane represents Mark's inner desire, but his (turning back or turning back (segun)) shows the difficulties in getting rid of these bonds and how 'I said , A describes the death of the dream from these difficulties to win the game. From my point of view a film to remember.
