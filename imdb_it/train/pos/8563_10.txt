The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (it could be translated as "The most beloved among humans"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that became something like La Bible or the story of Hamlet, very popular and difficult to obtain, because of its satirical content on the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a "red" world. A film full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite its psychological charge (after all, it's a European film).
