This has just been broadcast by the BBC and I am absolutely delighted to have seen it. As the credits flipped, the cast alone made sure I tried. After just five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was formulated and predictable, but somehow added to its charm. The 1940s flashbacks were wonderfully positioned and captured a feeling that was matched in a few productions. <br /> <br /> A true wellness film, punctuated by exceptional music. When it is released, I will buy it!
