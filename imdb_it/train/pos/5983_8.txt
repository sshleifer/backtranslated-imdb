I saw this film for the first time as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal dominated the world. Trick or treat has every element for a film that oscillates. With a cast presenting Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as Preacher, how can you go wrong? Evil messages backwards played on vinyl! Yes, that's right, they use the records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rock star on his turntable when things start to scare. The monsters start to come out of its speakers and its stereo becomes possessed. As a teenager I tried to play my records back hoping it would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick or Treat is still one of my favorite movies of all time.
