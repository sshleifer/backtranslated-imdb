Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but they are never less interesting. "Insignificance" is obviously, first and foremost, an adapted stage game: it is verbose and very "very tied to the room". BUT, it pays to see this film more than once: the underlying themes are not presented openly and, moreover, it takes a while to adapt to the juxtaposition and reversal of roles of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is shocked by the guilt about Hiroshima, yet he imagines the simplicity of a sexual relationship with Munro; Munro is sick of being seen as a child and craves intellectual belief; Senator McCarthy is at the peak of his witch-hunt powers but is a powerless sleazebag; DiMaggio is not sure of his celebrity, obsessed with himself and prone to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. Each character has a troubled, abused / offensive past and a questionable future. Little by little, we see that the obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with its post-war icons and cultural customs; the obsessions of the protagonists for something that nobody can have: peace-of-mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, a proposed unified field theory and, indeed, the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of the protagonists of Roeg seem insignificant. Yet these aspects of the physical universe (it's all quantum, believe me!) Influence us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. In fact, ALL the references within the script are accessible only to an experienced viewer: an au fait with occurrences from the 1950s / personality cults and how they influence us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script are either very, very intelligent, or extremely opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, however, probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> live long and prosper :) <br /> <br />
