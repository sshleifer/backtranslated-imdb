This is what a film should be when trying to capture the essence of what is very surreal. It has this confused nuance that is rarely captured in the film, it looks like a dream sequence and really transports you into a dark and haunting memory. The boys were extremely credible and I expect some things to come out in the future. A very natural acting for the younger ones, I don't know if Bill pulled him out of there or just so good, but no less excellent. Bill scored for me and for KevNJeff's comment on Paxtons' bad actor, what can be done in that role. He played the part pretty well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said that Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawke's version?) Wow ......... Don't listen to his comments. A great touch to make you feel really uncomfortable, if that's what you want? Cinematography also achieves an above-average rating.
