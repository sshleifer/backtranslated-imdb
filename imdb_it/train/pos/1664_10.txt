I thought this film was amazing, with the absolutely exceptional performances of Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi interprets Artemisia so beautifully, with temporary but confident mannerisms, his hands trace an idea before moving his models into place. The passion that Artemisia gives to his art is simply spectacular to observe. <br /> <br /> Although not all the characters were of excessive beauty, this made the film more realistic as the hair and clothes of the face were perfect for that moment. <br /> <br /> In general I thought this movie was fantastic.
