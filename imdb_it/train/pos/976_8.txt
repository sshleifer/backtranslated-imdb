Takashi Miike's incursion into the children's territory conquered me almost immediately because it shows courage and courage in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought there was something sinister about most fairy tales; Horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a little scarier (and more disturbing) than what they seem to be at first sight. The director brings the archetypal story of a boy into a wonderful search outside the preschool classroom. Accentuate the true fears of a world full of endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to minimize the seriousness of the bedtime stories written especially for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of history but also shows signs of a brake. But a Miike with its self-esteem is even stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
