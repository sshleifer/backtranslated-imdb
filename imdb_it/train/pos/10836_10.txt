I thought this movie was fantastic. It was fun. It reminded me of the Spinal Tap. This is a must for any 70s rock fan. (I hope my friends and I are not like that in twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy offers an excellent performance as an outgoing singer who tries to win back that old spirit, <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the film like the glue that tries to hold the band together, but is not succeeding. <br /> <br /> If you love music, and you've always been in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not regret seeing this movie. I know I don't know. My family also found it funny, and that's saying something.
