I've loved this show since its first airing, and I've always wanted to watch every episode every week. The plot, the characters, the writing, the special affections were exceptional! Then the science fiction channel messed up once again and canceled a very funny and well written show. I say bring him back, I know that all the actors will come back. I would suggest buying the DVD, I am. I hope the leaders of science fiction channels will take word on these comments and realize that they must be more involved with their viewers. Now I only watch one show on that channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they will soon cancel that one too.
