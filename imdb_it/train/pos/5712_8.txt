This is an irresistible, cheerful and technically done film! <br /> <br /> The film features some of the most beautiful sets you will see in the films of the 1930s, although it is too obvious that they are sets, rather than real places. Often, if a character falls or shakes a too aggressive door, the whole set will obviously move. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were the quietest, most antiquated and slapstick moments. It shows that René Clair's true heart was silent cinema. The general humor is really great in this film. Moreover, of course, the musical moments were more than great. This is a very pleasant and light French music, simple and pleasant. Even if the best moments are moments of silence, this does not mean that the film is not full of a great humorous dialogue, which gets very well from the main actors, who all seemed to me theatrical actors, who in this case worked extremely well for the film its general style and pleasant atmosphere without worries. No wonder this worked so well, since this film is actually based on the play by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> It is a really fantastic technical film, with some great innovations in camera work and some really great editing, which creates some quick and pleasant steps to watch funny sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a smart director, who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It is a very creative film, which despite its simplicity is always a totally original and ingeniously constructed film, which it never captures for entertaining. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is particularly unforgettable, without breaking down too much, and it is really among the greatest, as well as the most creative moments in the first cinematographic comedy. <br /> <br /> The film is full of really funny characters, who are obviously all very stereotyped and stupid and were obviously expressed for their appearance. All this contributes to the pleasant light atmosphere and the delicacy of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you've ever seen! <br /> <br /> 8/10
