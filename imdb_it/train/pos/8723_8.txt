The animation was fabulous and the film was fun. The two circus insects, Tuck / Roll were very funny. If you have waited until the end of the credits, you have seen a very funny sequence of movies, in which they showed the bugs that pretended to do wrong things like in other films, which was smart because it made the characters more human and credible.
