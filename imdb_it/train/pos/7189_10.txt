My favorite character in the movies, but in almost everyone Zorro's character has a bit of cloth as a mask and if the bad guy can't tell who's under that stuff, then they're crazy. <br /> <br /> But in the "Zorro Combatant League" by Reed Hadley (1939 series) the mask fills his whole face making it a true mystery to who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But still Zorro is one of the best films of the characters and to update it I think that Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is vast, but I have a real sympathy for the 1930s / 1940s series .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
