Alongside "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It is a real pity that it is not as well known as the previous films (perhaps because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than on contemporary or science fiction settings, and which is British, which means a smaller market for films) but it is wonderful know that reputation is deserved. <br /> <br /> Like all great family movies, one can be a child, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (there are currently 18), but you must appreciate classic movies first. I absolutely love this movie. It has an extraordinary soundtrack by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic soundtrack) that rivals any soundtrack by John Williams "Star Wars", a fast but unobtrusive rhythm, beautiful sets, dialogues and use of color (both the sets that the cinematography won the Oscars) and the Oscar-winning special effects (for the moment and some still wonderful). And, of course, the sultry appearance of June Duprez as the Princess rivals that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' (it even looks like Jones in a sense!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies over time (alongside "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and really deserves more attention. It's a real spell adventure everywhere and, together with "Robin Hood", it's my film about the desert islands that I could see over and over again without getting bored. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
