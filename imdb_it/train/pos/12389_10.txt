Bored by the normal base films to watch this Halloween that I saw over and over again, I took the opportunity for "The Sentinel", hoping that it could make my horror juices flow again. Mind you, I had just come back from seeing the remake of the Dark Castle of "The House on Haunted Hill" - complete and complete shit. Fortunately, "The Sentinel", BLEW ME AWAY! In a compelling story about a model moving to a creepy building in Brooklyn Hights, the film offered everything I hope to find in a good movie: (1) Campy and imaginatively juicy characters, exchanges and dialogues, including hilarious laps by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and above all, Martin Balsam, as distracted professor - (2) Terrifying terror! Not to give a frame of distance, but there are scenes in this film that have cooled me to my pancreas - (3) Gore fantastic, fantastic makeup and extravagant direction (if very irregular) by Michael Winner, which flows rather well with this unreal to deal. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this film - after looking at it for the first time, with my mouth open, I wrapped it up and looked at it again. Now it is an all-time favorite. Do yourself a favor and take a look!
