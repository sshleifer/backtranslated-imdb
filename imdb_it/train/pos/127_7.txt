Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another noir film set in the rubble of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there is a very creative machine work. There is an innocent American who is emotionally moved by a woman who does not really understand, and whose naivety is all the more surprising in contrast to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I should say that The Third Man has a nicer plot. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this regard. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it too coherent would ruin the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is inexorably gloomy - "noir" in more ways than one; you never see the sun shine. Grim, but intriguing and scary.
