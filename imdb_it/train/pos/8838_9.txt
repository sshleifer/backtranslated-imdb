Finally a film in which the audience guesses what will happen until the end. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spiral into destruction since nothing else is there to go but down, but we don't know how or when until end of the film. Hoffman is superb, as usual, and even Hawke was as decent as his younger brother who basically does what he is told because he can't think for himself. Hawke could have been a little out of his element, but he played the part quite well. Add to this mix Andy's wife, played to perfection by Marisa Tomei, cheating with Hank; Misappropriation by Andy of company funds to pay for his addictions to drugs and sex; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie will make you think.
