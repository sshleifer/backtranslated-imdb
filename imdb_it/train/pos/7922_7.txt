In this feeling of horror films, cold war paranoia of the 1950s, Reagan era America and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the quarterback of the stars of Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to communist Romania and while he is lost on the road one evening, he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the United States, he cannot control his animalistic impulses and continues to revel. Frustrated, he flees the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and registers again in high school. He still can't control his transformations, and the inhabitants of the city, and his friends, realize that he is not entirely human. Everything culminates during the big school football game. <br /> <br /> I expected this to be one of those "so bad is good" movies from the early 1980s. But I was surprised that the film was actually legitimately funny. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as pervy coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's former flame, Demond Wilson as a bus driver and Alan Arkin as an extravagant doctor, do everything with hilarious results. <br /> <br /> While watching this film, I was struck by the way in which writing and humor were similar to "Family Guy". "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and never takes itself seriously.
