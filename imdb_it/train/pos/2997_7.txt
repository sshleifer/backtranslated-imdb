William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case", a 1933 film starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo entered his Scottish Captain Terrier serves as the background for a room closed mystery with too many suspects. The mystery is very intelligent and the epilogue is complicated and interesting. Since the talkies are still quite young, the operation of the camera is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent; the whole cast takes the film up a notch. Many actors have starred in Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played the most (five times) and is the best choice for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was done before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to the great celebrity - he had spent about 12 years in the film for then, starting his career on the stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable stage presence and a remarkable actor who lived for almost 92 years. We are so lucky to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a fun movie - not to be missed.
