Remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was an animator in Terrytoons, then in Paramount Cartoon Studios, after that, was a director on Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, this is Coonskin. And it's actually pretty good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (No, duh, it was a working title.) But with a turn that becomes a flash of a Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> <br /> They are Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friends, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas), to escape from prison, but are stopped by a place of block and end up in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to the other escaped Pappy (Scatman Crothers), as he begins to tell Randy a story about "three boys, I knew him, just like you and your friends". Pappy's story is told in series of animations on live-action photos and background movies. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (voice of White) and Preacher Fox (voice of Gordone) decide to pack and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and he sells it to a man who turns her into a brothel. Arriving in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox discover that it is not all that was conceived. They meet a con man named Simple Savior, a fake revolutionary leader who claims to be the "cousin" of Black Jesus, and who gives his followers "the strength to kill the whites". In a showy stage show in his "church", Salvatore acts to be brutalized by symbols of black oppression represented by the images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners "donations". <br /> <br /> Rabbit first comes across against Madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white policeman and the man of the bags for the mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including the refusal to do the bath before an early meeting with them (he believes it is not worth it). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit has taken his profits, he and his cohort, Ruby and Bobby, are taken to a nightclub called "The Cottontail". <br /> <br /> A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Madigan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then manipulated into sexual intercourse with a stereotypical homosexual man, and then pushed into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype, adorned in something racist, and finally pushed out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> Then, as he recovers from the delirium of being drugged, he randomly shoots his gun, and is shot dead by the police after shooting one of them. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opponent boxer descend from the boxing arena as it explodes. The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping while being hit by various white policemen, but they manage to survive. <br /> <br /> This film was controversial in that release period, and was filmed by the director several times with the title, Street Fight, which is obvious, since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary on the racism in the streets. In reality, this film has the same subject as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This caused the closure of Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this film and the original Tobe Hopper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but due to racism, Bryanston took over the production of Bakshi. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth it. The animation was fantastic at the time, the plot makes sense, and it's fun too. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: 9/10
