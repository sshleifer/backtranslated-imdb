I found it very intellectual and artistic in every way! I felt that the script conveyed all the things that I feel physically and emotionally when I came home from work and saw it. this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format. <br /> <br /> holy guacamole! how I wish those days would come back. I tried to put a bubble window on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but the void formed muffin trays that didn't cut it at all. even in my civic, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by the waterbed, as it is brilliantly depicted in the 'van'. <br /> <br /> 'the van' is the most extreme part that splits hilarity and can even replace porn if you watch some scenes privately. <br /> <br /> I expect a lot that Sam Grossman (the director) made his opus. <br /> <br /> john Ratings: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
