One word: suPURRRRb! I don't think I've seen anything like this on the net or cable television for a long time. Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air among television shows full of reality shows and boring shots. <br /> <br /> I must say I had my reservations. After all, the critics were almost unanimous in crying and ruining the show. But when half an hour is over (by the way, thanks, NBC, for conducting a show without ads), I still have the feeling of an instant love, love at first sight, the true love that you feel in your guts . Everything about this show has screamed EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics of this show were at least at the height of Finding Nemo and Shrek. It was no small feat considering that these films took years to develop. <br /> <br /> The cast was wonderful. I'm partial to the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team was certainly on a par with John. Special Mention: Lisa Kudrow's guest appearance. She was at the top of the game creating a neurotic, plump, lovable panda with a Jewish vein in her. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this show.) <br /> <br /> Script was fun, with lots of jokes inside and for adults that were sharp but not tacky. A note for all parents: NOT for children. This show has never been advertised as such, and there's a reason why it's set for 9PM, not 8PM. So, if you feel like complaining about the "questionable context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and Father of Pride is. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a bit puzzled by the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, I'm gay. Yes, they are extravagant. Yes, they speak with German accents. But this is yesterday's news. Give us something new, something fresh, something fun. Putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "stellar power" that these guys have. It's OK for me. But please don't dwell on something that everyone already knows by heart. I hope the rest of the show doesn't play the same old record over and over again. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is definitely a Must-See-TV. Funny, witty, with some unexpected twists and turns here - there hasn't been such a beautiful comedy since Seinfeld. I look forward to the next episode.
