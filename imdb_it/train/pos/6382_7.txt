Definitely a great idea, the script was OK. It would have been better, the positives are that you will not be bored if you are an adventure lover, A new idea of ​​the lost world of Atlantis. Negatives are that I personally feel that this idea had much more potential than this. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this. It wasn't bad at all, but it would have been a lot better with a little more runtime. to say that it was boring or not good .. A good for people who like adventure animations like Sindbad, like The Road to the Dorado. This movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice adventure with a very nice happy end.
