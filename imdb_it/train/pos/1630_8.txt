I could very well be one of the few who really joined this film. I saw this movie even when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was way ahead of his time. The humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine. I don't see why MAD is behind this feature. He was also one of the few films of the early 80s to have a killer who accompanied the soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from L.A. at the time. I own the soundtrack and I play it constantly until today. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies out there. I don't consider Porky to be as fun as Up The Academy, there are some really good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall on stereotypes or fuck. Hey, nobody said it would be The Maltese Falcon.
