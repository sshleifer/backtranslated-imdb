I found this movie by mistake many years ago and wondered then (I still do) why it didn't get the applause it should have. A well-written, beautiful acting, an ironic twist after another, and HERE IS PLAUSIBILITY in what the evil characters are trying. I would not recommend this film for people with short periods of attention; it requires sufficient intelligence to understand that perhaps there is a nucleus of truth in this story.
