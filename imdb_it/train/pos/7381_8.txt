IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners of a company together with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the former contract a professional assassin, ANISIO, to kill ESTEVÃO (the plot, at least at the beginning, does not do it t explain very well why). The boy does it and after receiving his money he starts to blackmail the two partners, appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something ??). At the same time she meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVÃO, and starts dating her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be persecuted, except for MARINA, who is the only person you don't know what is this happening and haven't you betrayed anyone ?? <br /> <br /> This film sarcastically portrays the sad and cruel reality that exists in the great metropolises like San Paolo, where crime is the presence of every day. We can feel irony, but also veracity in characters like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), who blackmails the guys who paid him without scruples and even flirts with the daughter of the boy he killed! He must really be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him out there, in Brazil or anywhere else? <br /> <br /> Is it a very beautiful film, cruel but truthful, about a sad reality? The acting is great and also the soundtrack.
