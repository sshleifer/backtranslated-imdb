While I was the video store, I was looking at dollar bills and came across this little gem. I don't know what it was, but I just had an instinct about it and wow I've always been right. <br /> <br /> The story centers on two girls who have just survived a school shootout. One of the girls is Alicia a teenager who is the only witness to the complete attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by a miracle. Put together by destiny, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful demonstration of healing and movement. <br /> <br /> I hate when incredible movies fall through cracks. Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was seriously lacking in special features. Oh, and some of the jumps in the movie were a bit jarring. But all in all an excellent film.
