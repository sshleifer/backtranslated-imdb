This is one of the best films around and that means it was for television. I really wish the dv. Helen Hunt had given such a stark performance. He played a novice cop perfectly thrown in the case of the serial killer. When he falls apart because he kills another boy it was incredible. She is so lonely, so he comes to her. When he talks about his mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as a serial killer was really shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. He was worthy of an Oscar. When he talks about killing children, scary! When he realizes who he really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really don't make them that way anymore. It was a real thriller without being gory.
