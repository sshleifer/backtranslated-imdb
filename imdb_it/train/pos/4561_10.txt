I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I see it it becomes more personal and more exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Acting is amazing, which is not hard to believe as it is Daniel Day Lewis, who is a fantastic actor. Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder, though. Capture your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who is unable to walk or talk until he is in his late teens. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough good things about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies that are based on real events or simply enjoy beautiful dramas in general.
