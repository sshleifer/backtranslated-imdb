I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless it's driving me away. I found him sick, brilliant, twisted and psychologically sophisticated. You won't go deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this. It has layers inside of layers, faded acting of Stone and a texture that will make you guess even after it's over. People need to overcome the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 and that Michael Douglas is not in this. I predict this film will be a big hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the professional critics who are out of the picture. Give it a try, you might be glad you did!
