I saw it and I like it Melissa plays her part well. In reality it was credible. My brother-in-law saw him with my sister and me and when I spoke to my sister I had forgotten that it was based on a true story (I had seen it a few years ago). He said just because it's a life you think is true and both my sister and I were like it anyway I was wondering if anyone knew what murder was or was really involved was because I wanted to prove it to him. I love movies for life, especially real ones, or just those that teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I don't remember where any help would have been appreciated.
