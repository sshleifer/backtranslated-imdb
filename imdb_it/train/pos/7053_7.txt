Do not confuse "War Inc." for a sharply chiselled satire or an intelligent comedy full of jokes for news lovers. It is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old screwball comedy, with ridiculously concomitant twists, series characters (with some depth in the amusing performances of John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and an approach direct to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political points of the filmmakers are things that almost the whole country already knows that they are true. Yes, we understand that the multinationals that profit from the war are corrupt pigs, the political leaders who are in charge of it are even more funny inept, and American imperialism has never seemed more large and out of control than it is right now - but none of this is the point. <br /> <br /> Here, all that noise is the setting they cheat - sometimes ingeniously - as a backdrop for a foolish game, like the character of John Cusack (the success - man with a heart) seeks to change his life with the help of the do-good journalist who doesn't trust him (Tomei) and the young Middle Eastern actress who wants to give up his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her assistant with an almost comically comic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed wasted in his smallest part as a ruthless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's it, and it works. It's fun, but if somehow you can't see the reality and you think the war is going well and everyone in it is doing a good job and there is no corruption and people in the Middle East would like our Western culture supplanted theirs, so you might not find it so funny. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political advantage.
