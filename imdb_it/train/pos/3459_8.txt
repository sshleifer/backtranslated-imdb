Along with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic villain of Columbo. The first "correct" episode of Columbo, followed by two autonomous pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from the classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, one half of an association for writing a mysterious murder. His partner Jim is the talented, while Ken has no talent but the gift of gab and a skill in promoting books. As soon as Jim decided that he no longer requires Ken's marketing skills, Ken hatches a plot to kill Jim. Except it's not a new plot, it's actually the implementation in real life of a plot of murders originally intended for one of their books. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take much in Columbo to understand that Ken is the murderer, although unfortunately another murder must happen (Ken makes a novel and then kills a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to get a conviction. <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong with "Murder from the Book", but it's not quite as good as it should be. I would simply give "Publish Or Perish" beyond this: both episodes feature Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish Or Perish" is a more tense and unpredictable fraction. But this is still a great episode.
