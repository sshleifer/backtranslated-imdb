I must say, from the beginning, when I saw the Stargate movie that I didn't like anything or it was like a medium science fiction movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, even if the film wasn't like that, erm, fantastic like other movies science fiction like Star wars or aliens, that if you are a science fiction fanatic you will admit that one of these two titles is surprising, even if I'm not a fan of science fiction like some people, they are not Remember a line of one of those movies, I'm not a big fan of wearing Star Wars shirts, in fact if you saw me you would seem like an average person, ah, being a little off the point here, well my point is that you don't have to be a hardcore science fiction fan to appreciate this fantastic series, which unfortunately ended after 10 fantastic seasons without any decrease in its quality, approaching the end of 2006. <br /> <br /> Even though I didn't like the film very much, I couldn't wait for the first season to start of 1 997, and let me say that special effects were just one of the illusory things about the series, the chemistry between the characters simply destroyed my special affections, they were good if not better than most of the science fiction shows going on today. I must admit that I would never have entered Sci Fi had it not been for stargate, and my father, who actually let me get into the sci-fi when I was 6, and I'm glad I did, other essays I wouldn't have seen brilliant shows like the SG1, which in my opinion now sets the benchmark for almost all science fiction series and films, in practice if a new science fiction series isn't as good or as good as SG1, it's not worth looking at. basically this is the best science fiction show to date, and if you don't watch it, you have no idea what you're missing out on!
