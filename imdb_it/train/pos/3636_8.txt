This is a pleasant film, about a person's dreams and the push or drive to make them. It is a beautiful and inspirational film. Because some people have to try to find flaws in every movie that comes out, especially good ones. Dennis Quaid offers a good solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher and baseball coach who is pushed by his team to still make a shot in a professional baseball career. With an excellent supporting cast, including Brian Cox, as the old former naval officer who let many of his son's successes pass without his support. It was nice to see it as something other than a villain in a movie. If I have a complaint with this film, it's this: never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". Evaluate two thumbs up and a large "well done".
