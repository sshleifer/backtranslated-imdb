With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, how can you go wrong. Very unusual scenarios, especially modern ones. The construction of modern machinery is very effective. Here you have bursts of beam bullets from building vehicles that help clean up the area, so you can create new structures. Although he is much younger in this film, it is not very difficult to understand who the future Mrs Pumphrey of the BBC series will be, All Creatures Great and Small! Really effective reappearance of Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The soundtrack is by the famous Swiss composer, Artur Honegger, and is also unusual. For the moment (1936) it seems that they used really big series or the effects made it look like this. Finally, it's really a good story.
