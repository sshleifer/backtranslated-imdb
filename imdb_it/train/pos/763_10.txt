This film changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but I had never seen it done professionally (hey, I was an 11-year-old Dutch boy!) When I saw this movie, everything changed . I was actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city, I started dancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I consider this film a favorite. Of course, filming and "cinematographic" importance may not be as significant. But who cares if the wide field was badly turned or if you saw a microphone hanging over someone? That's the one for you personally that counts ...
