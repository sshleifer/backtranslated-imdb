If anyone ever wonders if cinema is an art form, it can be worse than focusing on this film. <br /> <br /> It is simply the perfect combination of history, script, actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a convicted bomber pilot who missed his heavenly orchestra conductor in the English fog during World War II, and his subsequent brushstrokes with the heavenly authorities (or is in his head) he is played with a wit of David Niven and Kim Hunter and is incredibly moving - especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot (Niven) describes his situation on the ground radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The sense of another world is intensified by the photography of Jack Cardiff and the incredible production projects. <br /> <br /> The supreme touches extend to the celestial shots that appear in black and white and terrestrial scenes presented in Technicolor - this is also mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not just a pinnacle in British cinema, but a pinnacle in cinema, period.
