The writers Perry and Randy Howze have made a very engaging little story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who returns to his ex-wife's home many years later, the plot takes unexpected, delightful turns. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four-year-old Robert Downey, Jr. makes a delightful performance, ably assisted by Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has the right chemistry for this caper, playing with one another in a graceful style. I've watched this movie a number of times on TV, and every time I found it more enjoyable.
