Memorable film, intelligent and full of suspense by one of the true geniuses of French cinema, the formidable Henry Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel to the assassination of JFK and takes place in a fictitious non-descriptive country. The film, both visually and at the plot level, is extremely sharp. Shot with meticulous precision, follows Henry Volnay, the Prosecutor who takes care of revealing the coup. In many ways, it is a very disturbing film, not least because of the cold and analytical precision of its commentary on the internal mechanisms of the so-called modern state. The atmosphere and the characters are quite believable, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in his tight plot. On another level, this relatively little-known film has just had a 15-year start on Oliver Stone, who was hailed for the movie "JFK", an inferior film in many areas, least of which is not credible ... <br /> <br /> It is a masterpiece, any movie lover should see it, preferably in its original French version with subtitles.
