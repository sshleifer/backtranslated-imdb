An excellent adaptation of the novel by Amrita Pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai gave their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural touch in the film and I felt it immediately. It seemed that Bollywood had finally given away its charm and that some quality artists would perform on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the content, the film represented very exactly what happened during the partition showing the suffering of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part is that they didn't become a drama with a lot of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I simply loved it.
