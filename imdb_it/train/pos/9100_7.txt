Spanish films are, if not gold, certainly an age of silver. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the feelings are strong or almost at the level of life and death, they are still not really melodramatic. This could happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here that become connected. One concerns the retarded girl, who does not have the courage to pass the road to the next block. One concerns the middle-aged woman who finds her life's lover in a foot fetishist. Another concerns the girl with drug problems that the lover leaves her. Yet another concerns the madame of a brothel who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain that filmmakers take women seriously.
