The obvious parallels between the fascinating fantasy of Bedknobs and Broomsticks and the C.S. Walt Disney's Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty obvious. There are more coincidences here than the comparison of Bedknobs and Broomsticks compared to Mary Poppins, although many of her own creative talents have gone on to the two Disney films. <br /> <br /> Like The Chronicles of Narnia involves some English children leaving London during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And those children have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike the C.S. Lewis the boys from Rawlins have the magic to invade their world and help defeat the people who make a mess of it in the here and now. No retreat into a fantasy realm like the Pevensie children. <br /> <br /> No heavy duty philosophy here by Walt Disney, except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentices like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury has never been one of the most bankable artists for nothing. It bears its magic mark that even the guys from Disney's special effects couldn't get over. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this movie. <br /> <br /> Two artists gave their farewell to the films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she loved many films in the UK as one of their best chamber music performers. And that great actor Reginald Owen in the role of the retired general who leads the old domestic guard at war and in the offerings for the songs is aimed at the audience of films from all over the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and useful one. The Age of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost the Shaft theme. Personally, though, I like the tribute of David Tomlinson to Portabello Road, the most colorful of London's streets. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a beautiful fantasy film that holds up well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer-generated graphics.
