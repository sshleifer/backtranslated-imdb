Charles Boyer should be Spanish, and he came to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent", a 1945 film starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he is accused of murder but is determined to take coal for his people so they can fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This film has its good points and not so good. He's tall for the atmosphere and for the suspense, and he's very funny. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is bad, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix appropriately pathetic, and Seymour outrageously wonderful. <br /> <br /> The points not so good: Bacall should be English, and Spanish Boyer. Uh, no. Boyer is exceptional in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a bit uncomfortable. Not even his acting is able to sniff; she's better at other movies. But she is a woman of surprising appearance, and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost exaggerated and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a guest of the hotel that studies human nature. It's a big part and his performance is perfect, while some of the other actors aren't that good. This was certainly a case of small parts, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.
