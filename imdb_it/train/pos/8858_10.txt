I have to admit that this is the kind of film I would normally avoid, but I rented it basically because of the stars. I certainly didn't mind. In fact, as you can see, I rated it five stars. This film is the perfect combination of acute directing and superior acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the crude crime of stealing their parents' jewelry. The crime is terribly wrong, thus starting an examination of the three men of the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we meet Charles Hanson and we come to understand the tense relationship between father and children. <br /> <br /> Younger brother, Hank is basically a vice. He has always had problems keeping a job and practically goes in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure, a coward and very much under the influence of his older brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank "nailed to a T" and gives what is probably his best performance so far. He shows us a man who is fundamentally good-hearted but so influenced by external forces that he cannot follow an important task. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - seems to be a successful businessman, but we soon find out that he is addicted to drugs and has appropriated his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who invented the scheme to rob his parents' shop, and Hank has the weak will to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - certainly one of the best actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a fascinating businessman appreciated by his acquaintances but a real ball of slime underneath. It's absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or you could say that, through his superior acting skills, he made Andy the perfect part. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a common father to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or callous man, but he has a bad relationship with his children because he never really understood what was necessary in cultivating a positive bond between his children and himself. He has always been too quick to criticize and warn. He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his elder, causing an emotional rift between him and Andy. Knowing Charles and Andy, the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob his father becomes less incredible. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I can't believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my father, and how Andy and Hank reminded me of my brother and myself. Perhaps this could be one of the reasons why I enjoyed the film as much as this story of a distant and critical father, a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother found themselves so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I never got to the state of committing a crime against my parents, I suppose we were made of stricter and more moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex of personalities and actions has been cleverly put together by director, Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the audience compelling characters and the hypnotizing place-side action. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years before Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, but he hasn't lost any of his magic touch by showing us characters that will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> Before the Devil Knows You're Dead events and characters are hard and unattractive, and this is definitely not a good mood movie. However, they are two hours of definitive fun that I highly recommend.
