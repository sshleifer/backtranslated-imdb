YETI deserves the 8-star rating because it is one of the biggest bad films ever made. I saw him at a midnight screening in the L.A. and people were roaring and cheering for madness - this movie is one of those movie trader in which you think you can't find any stranger and THEN FA! The millionaire who funds the project to defrost the Yeti seems that Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured in an inadequate outfit - the boy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors to appear on the screen - and yes, there is a silent boy (who somehow seems a bit like a girl) and has been silent since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm - maybe therapy for the child ??). Then this beautiful Italian girl is seen by Yeti (once she melts - which she ALWAYS takes) - and if he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things in the film is that this giant Yeti is "camera eyes "to her - she is like a great Barry White trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, once the big Yeti picks up the bomb and puts it against his chest - he accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple and yes, the movie takes the time to show his gray nipple GET HARD !!!! Yikes of all YIKES! In addition there is a collie dog because the Italian producer must have heard that the American public loves dogs and somehow tried to get a Lassie - there is also this crazy scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - he holds the big fishbone and use it to comb the hair of the Italian girl "Damn, thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout. You're the best." This film is more bizarre than what Ed Wood could have ever imagined. If you are a fan of the shit of classic cinema, look for this child.
