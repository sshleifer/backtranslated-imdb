I was pleased to see that he had black hair! I have been a fan for about 30 years and I was disgusted by the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /> <br /> I was pleased that the writers updated the period to include a computer, it did not ruin everything. In fact I watched the movie twice in one day, a sure sign that it was up to standards. This is what I do with the books I like too. <br /> <br /> I thought that all the characters were well represented and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise very well, as demonstrated in both books and comics. I should also disagree with a comment made by a previous reviewer about the bad guys that must be ugly. Did he really read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very nice movie and I can't wait for the sequel to begin.
