Let's have a long story short. I loved every minute of it. A sumptuous fantasy in the style of a thousand and one nights. There is an evil wizard, a beautiful princess, a djinn and everyone lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. Unique quibble: the special effects are quite dated (loved Sabu with the djinn's foot though!)
