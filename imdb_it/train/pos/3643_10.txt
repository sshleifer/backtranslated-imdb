The end of an era was released here in the US in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie", a Disney action movie that seemed to be the "best for last !!!!!" It took place right here in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by a prefix found on a sign over there. It was a high school coach who was so convinced by his high-class baseball team that he decided to become a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: it was so beautiful !!! !! It was an excellent sports film, the "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. He had also brought spectators to Texas, somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). I can say this because I recognize that ballpark (it was "The Ballpark in Arlington", now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It was great to see Disney's "Golden Age" end up here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Golden Age of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920 -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with a mouse .. .and ended with baseball. " (hiccups) <br /> <br /> 10/10
