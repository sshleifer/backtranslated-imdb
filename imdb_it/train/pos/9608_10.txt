If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly suggest you do it. It's an excellent true story. I love Alison Lohman, she is a very talented note: I loved her even in seventh heaven. The whole plot is incredible and the way they chose there are fantastic waz characters. The acting in this film is very impressive <br /> <br />.
