Suraj Barjatya is the best in marriage films. And here it is; back to his basics on Vivaah. As the story goes, this is a story from engagement to marriage. A film that you can watch with your whole family around you. A movie you hate to watch alone. The plot is simple, but the music is good, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is the best, everything about the film has its own class. There are a lot of scenes that will make you cry and I'm sure that if you're watching the movie with your other half, both will keep you hand in hand until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita jodi gave us previously successful films like Ishq Vishq and Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, it was not well accepted by the public. A true film by Shahid and Amrita.
