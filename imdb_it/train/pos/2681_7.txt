As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific boy. He made hundreds and hundreds of movies, many of which are shit. However, he managed to occasionally sneak into quality work among all the exploitation of the assembly line. "Succubus" is not his best work (be it "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many of his brands that make it a must for anyone interested in immersing himself in his extensive catalog. Combines the erotic (alternating between showing full frontal nudity and leaving something left to the imagination) and the surreal seamless. This is a very dreamy film, full of great atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant namedropping. Despite being incredibly pretentious, it's fun to hear all of Franco's influences. <br /> <br /> However, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and can see where they come from. It has a nice rhythm, but I can deal with it. Inconsistency is more problematic. The script here was obviously rushed, and within five minutes of starting the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and from then on it never really came together). Who wants a substance with his style, look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it never becomes scary or even suspenseful. Still, I was entertained by all the psychedelic nonsense that I really didn't care about these big flaws. (7/10)
