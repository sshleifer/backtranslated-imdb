Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock find themselves trapped in the last ice age on the planet, while Captain Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, it is the previous couple that has the most difficult time. In addition to the freezing temperatures and the sanctuary that can only be found in the caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to return to his ancestors' behavioral patterns, feeling a natural attraction for Zarabeth and throwing "caution to the wind" to never leave this place. Only with Dr. McCoy's constant "reminders", Spock somehow takes reality into account. <br /> <br /> This represents one of the few times the character shows some "emotions" and Nimoy (Spock) plays it to the end, coming close to throwing out the Deforest Kelly (McCoy) bejesus. Surprising of the previous episode, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to get the girl, another advantage for this. <br /> <br /> Perennial "old man" Ian Wolfe tests the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio to the past.
