I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not even sure what's in particular, but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVDs. The women were strangers and yet they got along quite well to spend the time they had in the villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, have done an excellent job. The characters were all so different and intelligent that it made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship problems all in good time. This requires 10 lines, but I can't think of anything else to say, so I start to vibrate until I get 10 lines. I am sorry for this. What else can I say that it's been a long time since I saw it. I can't wait to see it again but it's not available.
