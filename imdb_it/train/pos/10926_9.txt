If you love kung-fu movies and haven't seen this movie, you're fooling yourself. This film is one of the few expensive kung-fu that could be recommended for fans of all types of films. Normally, it takes a huge fan to see something in these movies, but this one has it all! The story is well told and complete. The fight scenes are fantastic and tend to end before you are completely bored by them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw some mystery and torture and you have a hell of a movie. See this at all costs. Hell, my wife liked it too. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 9 on 10 <br /> <br />
