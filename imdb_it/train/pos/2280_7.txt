Difficult to classify the film - perhaps it is an avant-garde espionage thriller? Mother Night is a great novel by Vonnegut, and certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt to a feature film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The "indie" approach to the way this film was produced is probably more effective than a big Hollywood studio that funds it. These days, I doubt a clever novel like Mother Night ever received the green light from the Hollywood grindhouses. And normally it's too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a very narrow direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to have better roles as he gets older, still has that "human" character that allows him to play a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and fantastic as always. I always thought he deserved better than he left the entertainment industry. I imagine that making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little air time is not the best role, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. In any case, this film is absolutely fun and you don't have to read the book to understand the film. In fact, given the geopolitical realities of today, the premise of the novel may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of the story will be completely confused by the events taking place (I am talking to you, American comrades who are students the lowest score in the industrialized world in geography, history, and the lord knows what other topics!).
