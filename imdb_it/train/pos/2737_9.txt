The film was compelling from beginning to end and his black and white photography of the American heart is stunning. We feel that we are right there with them as they cross the great region of the sky and then to Mexico and back to America. Towards the end of the film, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake resembles small streams of sweat and tears running down his face. Finally, we follow them up the stairs to their last moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock can be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the boy with the stars in his eyes on the wrong side of the city. This point is made in the film and we are always surprised that criminals do not look different from anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two delirious men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that is not there. Once on the run, they start writing wrong checks, tracing a trail for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many good supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as a case detective, Alvin Dewey. Furthermore, Will Geer shines in a short but excellent scene like the prosecutor. <br /> <br /> I have often wanted to see this film to the end, after having read it only in brief fragments; I finally reached it after buying the DVD. The result is the best classic crime film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this fantastic movie. For me, this is all about great movie production.
