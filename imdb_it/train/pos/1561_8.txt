I really liked this episode. See Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (although all he did was swim) made me open my eyes. Seeing most of the founders of the Justice League, trying to bring down Lex Luthor, is what I've been waiting for. This sounds a bit off-topic, but doing a live Justice League show would definitely give me a reason to push everything I usually do during the week just to watch an episode. This is the thrill I had watching this episode. I wish they had made this episode a little longer, like a two-hour special, because I felt that an hour of the Justice League wasn't enough. Now before I get bored (unless I already have my wanderings) I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. He almost lost his touch when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the authors will return to that hole. :( So enjoy this episode, who knows when another good will come out, get it back on February 22nd, if you missed the first airing.
