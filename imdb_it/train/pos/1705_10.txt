"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I don't understand, because this film didn't get better critics, it's fun, harmless and sweet. I saw him for the first time at 11 and really fell in love with him ... 2 days later, I took him on VHS :-P To this day, I showed it to many friends, and everyone liked it, but nobody knew the film before. I think this is the problem, almost nobody knows it, so almost no one can appreciate it ... This film never had a chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc" ". "Spaceballs". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say is that, if you ever want to laugh out loud, look at it! Even if you don't get mad, it's worth watching! -> Get ready to laugh, scum of earth!
