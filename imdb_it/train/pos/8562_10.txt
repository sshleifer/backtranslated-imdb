I liked it! The plot was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC disagreed with both. Drews' acting was dubious in some places, but this may have been due to his life at that time. Dennis Christopher as the shrink was pretty strong, and as always does his best - I'm still a big fan of Dennis, that's why I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I didn't get the ending! that strange thing about the red animatronic skeleton seemed right out of the film school, which is OK, I think, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> .... and the whole thing with the knife - if it was so uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> He's been very confused since it was the strange thing about Doppelganger or when he was DC - or was it always Dennis? Because Doppelganger made friends with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick if he were Dennis as Doppelganger, I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was OK but intrusive in some places, the whole orchestral score seemed to revolve around a theme but this theme was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A great mix of blood and free shots by Drew naked. <br /> <br /> All in all a Geas-Guilty Pleasure movie. Don't read too much, don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you won't find it. There are a few moments of diamond and awkward in abundance- LOOK AND JUST HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH IT!
