This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after his return from war service, wanting to change his image by doing a western, which is largely considered the reason for the influx of westerns in the 1950s since which is very impressive. Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins the first prize for "the gun that won the West", but then he must pass the rest of the film trying to recover it when he is stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shadowy girl with an unpleasant reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local Bad Boy gunslinger in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boy. And you wouldn't know, being a Universal-International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both rather unknown at the time) have a few roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence presents the first Indian attack, so CHARLES DRAKE turns out to be a coward who leaves, leaving Shelley alone on the horse-drawn cart. Afterwards he redeems himself, but it is only one of the twists that passes the gun from one insecure hand to another - but in the end it ends with the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have a fairly conclusive shooting that is almost melodramatic (but not quite) as the final of DUEL IN THE SUN's blazing weapons. McNally is the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous as the bad man he played in the 1940s as a short gunslinger. <br /> <br /> The well-structured plot is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann, and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) wearing the Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who casts longing looks to the then thin and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing and certainly above average history.
