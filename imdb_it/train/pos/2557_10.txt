I, I am a child in my heart, which means that I love watching cartoons, I still do it! I remember seeing Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was still my favorite. I thought it was a big "new" TV show, and that my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching it when I was younger" and I'm like "Daddy, Bugs didn't exist when you were younger." So I guess he's definitely happy with more than one generation, maybe 3. I love the show is great for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, my husband and I, both twenty years old, love watching shows, and we don't even mind replicas. This show brings back many memories, the happy ones. I also love the Christmas special with Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can't choose my favorite Looney Toons character because they have changed over the years. When I was little, of course, they were Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is beautiful, I've always loved him. Actually, I have to say that there is all my favorite. I'm giving this show 10 out of 10, because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, vocal acting is incredible, the only flaw is that unfortunately it came to an end, 2 decades ago, but the shooting is great!
