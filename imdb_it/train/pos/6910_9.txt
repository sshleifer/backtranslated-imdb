Paul was totally robbed by someone who did Dave. It's the same story, not so fun though. <br /> <br /> Paul told me this morning about the scene in which sammy davis sings the new national parador anthem. arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Las Vegas, three planes, a car ride on the set, etc. has been beaten. could not bear, had to use a stick. he was in a trailer the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> he didn't know he could do it. then he saw the extra 6000 crowd, paid 7 dollars. came to life and shot that scene for two hours. it was magnificent, so it almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is an exceptional boy, although very liberal. a real talent.
