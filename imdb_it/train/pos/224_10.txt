The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I saw it for the first time when it was the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and I love it since. I ended up seeing it 6 times in theaters, and if it sounded today I'd go see it again. <br /> <br /> Now many reviews here mention the wonderful lead performances. Matthau was brilliant, but he had the misfortune of being a candidate for Randall P. MacMurphy's Oscar-winning performance in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Burns won, although Richard Benjiman at least deserved to be named too . the roles have been interpreted to perfection, as Fritz Feld for auditing for the spot of fries. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my reason for the review of this film, the direction of the very underrated Herbert Ross. the person plays "The Owl And The Pussycat" on the screen and made a complete movie, he still does. He opens the shows without making them look like a photographic theatrical representation, flipping through the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes from the movie before arriving at the scene that opens the comedy, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and talks to him about the comedy special. play during the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago I saw the Broadway revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think Ross and the writer, playwright Simon have improved us. It's just a wonderful movie.
