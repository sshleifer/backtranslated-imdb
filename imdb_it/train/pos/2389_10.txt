I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years and everyone loves Doodlebops. Doodlebops are energetic, lively and captivating. Once they start singing, '' We are the Doodlebops We are the Doodlebops We are the Doodlebops Oh yeah Come and join the fun because we are laughing and singing all day 'it's almost impossible not to join them The Doodlebops takes the viewer into a world of colors and fun. Every show is an adventure, the Doodlebops don't try to change the world with preaching messages all they do is have fun while solving the challenges of everyday life that the small child can relate to. Doodlebops is a refreshing and high-action alternative to television programs for regular children.
