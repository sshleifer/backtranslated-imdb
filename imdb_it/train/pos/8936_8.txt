After "Beau travail", everyone was waiting for Claire Denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never came. Now he has it. Denis takes a leap in quality in this film, an orgy of splendid cinematography, an elliptical montage and intentionally obscuring narrative events that feel strange and also act in a stranger way. There is a nominal plot (derived in part from the book of Jean-Luc Nancy with the same name) of a mature man who needs a heart transplant and who is looking for a Tahitian son whom he has long since abandoned; but above all it is an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes a couple of views to fully understand, and has stimulation problems near the end, but it's even more advanced and compelling than anything else I've seen this year. Missing at your own risk.
