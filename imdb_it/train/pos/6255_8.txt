This film shows people in the middle of the 2 hottest days in Austria. Show people who humiliate other people and who are cruel to other peoples. Show the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. <br /> <br /> In the screening I attended, people were going in the middle because they couldn't watch the movie anymore. And rightly so. Because the film is not easy to watch. It has a very depressing message and there is no moment of pity in the film. It is a very cruel film, not for all tastes. You can't talk about enjoyment terms from this movie. It catches you in the throat and never give up and in the end you just feel breathless because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I cannot "recommend" or "recommend" this film. You should create your mind based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that this is not a normal movie and is not for everyone.
