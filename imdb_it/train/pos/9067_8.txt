After being forced to sit among some stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". For once, I didn't guess the ending! It was fun and funny and did not resort to a lot of coarse humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both loved it - oh and my "boy" of 45 had a smile on his face all the time. This is a film for families that is not only tolerable for parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He doesn't stop singing just to annoy me !!" Furthermore, the way the new child tries to make friends and the way these friends are formed is right with the way children behave. Obviously parents have to behave in a slightly stupid way, but my favorite scenes involve the father getting used to his new job. Have a good time!
