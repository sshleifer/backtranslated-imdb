I was lucky to see Zero Day last night. It's a fantastic film. A very disturbing thing. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Zero Day is comparable to "The Blair Witch Project". It is shot completely with portable video cameras. There are about 2 children. Only your normal children. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against the High School entitled "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the form of Video Diary, with 2 children. Show relationships with parents, among other people, showing that these are just normal children, just like the people we know or have met. We find out that the last mission of The Army of 2 will be titled Zero Day. They plan to shoot High School over there. <br /> <br /> See how they get access to guns, how they plan it, everything. They stress that the media have not influenced them at all and there is no reason to do so. As I said, this is all said in the form of Video Diary, and then they store the tapes in a safe to be seen after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual footage is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school . Really cool. The film is very chilling. Some of the things they say, how they plan it, you should see it for yourself. A quote I remember is the only time Calvin is alone. He says "André thinks they went off in some escape machine, doing this in many schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm leaving school is in a black plastic bag." <br /> <br /> I'm probably not even giving you the right idea of ​​this movie. You really need to see it by yourself. He's going around festivals right now. <br /> <br /> A +.
