This film deserved better. It's very funny, it has some wonderful jokes and gags of sight, some in-stuff for the "Geeks" between us (and we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Watching Paul Reubens fart in front of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I've never read the comic book series before seeing the film, but since then. as good as I am, I still recommend the movie to MM. (Although having the character of Flaming Carrot would have been nice, too) Greg Kinnear is, well ... surprising as Capitan Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy My favorite line in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny and it looks like he ordered the lobster." Watch this movie. BUY this movie! They are only 5 dollars and some change in your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. You really will. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in it. THIS OTHER makes it worthy to be seen
