Rupert Friend gives a performance, like Prince Albert, which brings "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is superb. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a deep and dark depression after the death of Prince Albert and looked into the eyes of Ruper Friend I understood. The film does not lead us to his death but to an accident that could very well cost his life. An act of love I believed it, or I should say, him. I thought what he felt was real. Nothing or nobody comes close to the delicacy and depth of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good but I didn't believe it for a minute. It was Victoria. No real sense of the period. It may not have been his fault, but his prince deserved the crown.
