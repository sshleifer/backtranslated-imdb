Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! no, i'm not 10 years old .. i'm 30 years old! I own an old and original VHS of this that I bought from a rental store. I've seen it countless times .. <br /> <br /> while it's a fun movie for kids, it's an intriguing movie for adults. I once saw this movie while I was ... not sober. my eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I saw the moral to be strongly encouraged, both openly and somehow subliminally ... I wish I could remember all the things I noticed in particular, but it's been a long time since then. Be assured, there are tons of things referred to throughout the film. if you have the chance to see it .. it is not sober .. do it, you will not be disappointed .. indeed, you will probably feel rather happy and warm. <br /> <br /> unique and wonderful!
