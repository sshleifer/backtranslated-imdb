Let me say at the beginning that I have Cerebral Palsy and I went to this film expecting to have to take allowances for the main performance. I left the theater half convinced that they would play an actor with Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew it wasn't. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think it's her name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy has talent, brazen, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant, in other words human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portraits of life with CP. Not a complete portrait, but excellent examples of people with disabilities. Highly recommended.
