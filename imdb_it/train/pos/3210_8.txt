SOLDIER is not as bad as many have done. I found in the film some of the sacred and cynical humor like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and maximum action are deliberate and contribute to the atmosphere of the comic. <br /> <br /> A special trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space war tattoo campaigns on his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For those who can't see us, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the latest elegies of Roy Batty in Blade Runner. Imagining that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is shocking to say the least. Did writer David Peoples feel nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I will give this 3 out of 5.
