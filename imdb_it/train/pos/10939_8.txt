The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. There are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu movie: great choreography, horrible dubbing, different "styles" of combat, and a wide range of very exaggerated, often creamy human emotions. However the plot is certainly better than average. It is interesting and attracts your attention during non-combat scenes. Occasionally he is even able to turn on the audience, such as when the character X receives a horrible injustice. Another thing I love about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the film's morals and themes. Almost everyone gets what is coming to them. The cowards, the greedy and the corrupt are lost. The bad ones, consumed by selfish greed, are eventually destroyed by their own betrayal and stabbed in the back. Good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome the odds and get the most. <br /> <br /> Poisonous clan rocks!
