My dog ​​died recently, and this was a film I loved as a child, so I had to see it to try to cheer up. <br /> <br /> (Beware of Dog, I mean Spoiler.) This film is not for children only and is anything but ordinary. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. First of all, the dog was not interpreted as an extra member of the family in this film, but as an adult with his complicated life to deal with. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Charlie is not very different from his dishonest and brutal workmate, Carface. He is driven by money, greedy and escapes death row, as he says at the beginning of the film. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and her assistant, Itchy. Carface won't even listen to the fat, ugly dog ​​with the big glasses that are closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface attempts to kill the hero, because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and not content with only 50% - a very unusual way for a mix of German shepherds to die. Furthermore, being eaten by a prehistoric alligator that ends up saving your life because you can sing is highly unlikely to be a dog or not. This is a cartoon, which is why it is logical here. <br /> <br /> Carface's method of revenge is through murder, while Charlie believes success is the best revenge, the financial success it is. After surviving death, he started a business by taking the funding source of Carface, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a lot of races and Charlie tells them he will give the poor money - suggestion: Charlie and Itchy live in a landfill and are therefore poor. Use the money for your casino / bar / theater and not the other "poor". The reason why Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and listens carefully. He teaches Charlie's ethics by emphasizing his gambling, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to make up for it by buying his clothes. He added the ethics his business needed, while Charlie did the management and Itchy took care of the construction. Carface uses violence and property damage to bring down Charlie's business, which is not protected by the government. Charlie loses everything and all he has left is this child. In the end he had to choose between his life and his. First, grab the watch from the auto conservation and lower it when the girl starts to sink. The girl and the clock were sinking, and he had to choose which one, and chose the girl. <br /> <br /> The great part of this film that focuses on a person's ability to learn from evil over time and a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of their pet's death is that never shows anyone who dies! The clock symbolizes his life and the clock is shown submerged and stopped. All the deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. I haven't cried during this film so far, and I've made a lot more, that I had to write it and share it with you.
