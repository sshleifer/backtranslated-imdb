This Wrestlemania didn't do it for me. While some things, like the actual battle and the involvement of celebrities were a return to the good old days, so to speak, seemed to be more of an intellectual "In Your House" than anything else. Above average ... it's worth it for several games like the tag team title match, although it is noteworthy that the title change meant nothing, since it was canceled the next night.
