A great British Indy movie! The fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters makes some hilarious sets of drug pieces that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. It's great to see Phil Daniels on the big screen (although he changed teams from Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a gift for women! I liked the final scene of the fight with his nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on Top of the Pops! ... does not act ... is really a British hippie in good faith !!! You don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's directly in my collection of post-pub repetitions on Friday nights. <br /> <br /> Add a twist to this movie and you won't be disappointed.
