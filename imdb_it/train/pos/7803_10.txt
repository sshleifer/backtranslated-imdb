I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history lesson. it was electrifying and it was a brilliant insight into what really happened to Steve Biko during the period of the apartheid law. As someone can say that this film was the most boring or boring 2 hours and a half of their life I don't know why it made me hang up from beginning to end. it was nice how Denzel Washington played it and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for blacks. In one part Steve Biko tells a policeman that we are as weak and human as you are, this is to show them that he and all the other blacks in South Africa were not different from the whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he was strong for what he believed in and he didn't totally believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko have forged a strong friendship that shocked South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it to everyone. it helped me to see that racism is not right and that everyone is equal, their destiny should not be determined by someone's skin color. n
