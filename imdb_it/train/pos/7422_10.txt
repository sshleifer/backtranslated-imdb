As a longtime fan of Barbra, any publication of this type will be distorted. Apart from this, this film is classified as a classic. It has its flaws (emphasized in other posts), but it reveals a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and it is fascinating to watch the screen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make this movie his. I don't think she was ever satisfied. But he offers his fans a new Barbra (for the time) with the LIVE song, a young and fresh look and a very heavy acting. <br /> <br /> The plot is approximate, but exciting and contains your interest in everything. The extended "final" of a frame is hard to seduce for most non-Barbra fans, but it speaks to those who admire its talent. <br /> <br />
