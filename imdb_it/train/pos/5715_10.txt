Karen enters a Japanese house as Emma's replacement nurse, a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she meets a scary ghost. He will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good The settings are disturbing. I love the whole plot! The ending was shocking! I stopped in a scene where the boy was meowing so hard that the man found his sister upstairs and I was shocked. This is the scariest movie I've seen. I didn't see the Japanese version. I recommend it to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
