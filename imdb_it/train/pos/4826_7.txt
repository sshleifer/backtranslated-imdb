This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her early years as a monarch of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> "The young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated with immaculate details. The extravagant costumes, the sumptuous places and the beautiful landscaped gardens all make "The Young Victoria" really impressive. I was the most surprised by reflective cinematography. As each person is related to the background or in the foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me most was when Victoria speaks with Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the center of the door frame from the corner of Victoria, while from the corner of Melbourne Victoria lay between the space where Melbourne had her arm on her hips. <br /> <br /> The plot is too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events have passed in a hurry or are not even explained. I was expecting a great coronation scene, and disappointingly only lasted a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it had been longer, so that the events can be adequately explained without haste.
