Let's make one thing clear: this film does not seek to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Stranamore or Young Frankenstein. It's a stupid film, with three great female leads (I don't remember other comedies with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler of SNL and indie queen Parker Posey, as charming as ever. The story is basic: the three girls were "losers" in college, and they still are after defending them. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even have a blind date), Posey is an assistant for a senator (who "hasn't been touched by a man since Clinton was in charge" ... I understand that a few minutes later ... I'm a little slow, OK!), and Dracht has a gay girlfriend (SNL's Seth Meyers, funny). They must prevent the senator's "not cool" daughter (the ever-pretty Amber Tamblyn of the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") from embarrassing her during the spring break. So, of course, they have to go and watch over her, and some hilarity follows. All in all, a light comedy, simple, rather short and very funny
