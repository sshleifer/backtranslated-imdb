"It can contain spoilers * <br /> <br />" All Dogs Go to Heaven "is a great movie, I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old, I didn't understand it well but as I saw it more and more times I started to love him, I love the songs in this movie My favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon you will come home". These are beautiful songs. The only thing that bothers me about the movie is Charlie dying when I was little sister could not even look at that part. Also this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around. The sky is beautiful in the film and the "watches" are very clever, I also love Itchy, in fact I have 3 dachshunds alone, they are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall I love this movie and suggest everyone to see it.
