The film opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story of how his best friend - he makes that customer - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are close in a small apartment in New York, with little space in the closet and too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, the advertising printer Jim falls in love (or falls for!) With an advertisement for a house. Once he has bought the house, the bills and frustrations accumulate incessantly because everything that can go wrong with the construction of Jim's "dream house" goes wrong. <br /> <br /> One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a fascinating little comedy - not very tiring, without a great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughter is there from the beginning, when the alarm goes off and Jim tries to turn it off, only to be hindered at every turn by Muriel. The timing and delivery of lines and comic situations can only be given by a couple of experienced professionals, and that's exactly what Grant and Loy give us: refined performance, simple chemistry and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in a rather ungrateful role (it is clear that Grant's character, Jim, gets the lion's share of lines and acting, and Grant, as always, pulls out both with remarkable aplomb), but gives Muriel a color , a life and a bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Even Melvyn Douglas plays having fun to perfection, never beating a single wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes must be when Bill gets himself locked up in the "warehouse", and Jim goes to 'save' him ... just to get everyone in! Every little problem that arises for the Blandings renovation project - including the petty jealousy and an advertising campaign for "Wham" - seems to put together everything that * could * go wrong with building a new home but make it credible and a funny watch. 8/10
