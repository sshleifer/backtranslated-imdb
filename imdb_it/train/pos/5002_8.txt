I had the privilege of seeing some fragments of Aardman's original version of this show in the UK. It has always been fun and always fun. None of the spells have been lost in the translation - it is as fresh as the people interviewed - if a part of it is written or not, as has been said, it is out of place. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the only aspect that I probably love most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the porcupines that discuss the fear of needles, the painting monkey). The regulars really grow on you too, like the teenagers of Maryland horses and donkeys, most married couples (parrots, insects and cats to name a few) and the character of children's voices, and I really came digging the ferret! Monday has finally become a day to look forward to.
