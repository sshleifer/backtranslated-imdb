This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire, well told and provocative, we see the internal mechanisms of a world that has disappeared, and learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I like the story, the characters, the acting and the scenes. Some scenes have undergone rapid editing and the subtitles have sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character Safiya is wonderfully played by Marie Gillain who I am pleased to say that she did a fantastic job without doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are fascinating and adorable. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic than the world they are emulating.
