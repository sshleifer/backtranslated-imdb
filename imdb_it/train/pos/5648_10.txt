I recently bought the complete series of American Gothic on DVD and was impressed. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that were never transmitted. I loved "Ring of Fire" especially the stories I hadn't seen the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an exceptional player. I thought of Brenda Bakke that Selena Coombs was also superb in her performance. In fact, the whole cast was incredibly talented and had a great affinity with each other. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the series was fucked by the net (in collusion with a thriving group of censors) because it was really designed for viewing adults. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic novels and horror genres, offered brilliant characterizations supported by brilliant acting. <br /> <br /> I had the most terrible craving for the devil for once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most luscious "fallen angel" ever.
