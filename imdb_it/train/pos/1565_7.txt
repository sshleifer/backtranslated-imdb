I just saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was the first appearance of George Sanders as the Saint, in which he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting in a night club. With the help of his acquaintance, Inspector Fernack, who came down from New York, helps a daughter of a criminal boss. <br /> <br /> Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad movie Saint. To be seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
