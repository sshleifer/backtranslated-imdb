I saw this movie again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore Cary's childhood part [Leslie Howard]. Considering that <br /> <br /> at the time you can't show much on the screen, [not that there is much in the novel] the obsession of the character with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well transmitted to the public. I recommend this film to anyone who has ever fallen for another person and the other party has tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started working in the studio he started crying and could not finish more than a few lines and the whole project was blocked. It can be said that the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of at least part of it.
