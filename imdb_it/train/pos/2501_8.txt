I'm a fan of both actors / singers especially Gackt and when I find this movie for the first time and watch the trailer, I think it's a fool. After a long waiting period, I finally looked at it and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I consider that everyone knows the plot and we won't talk about it, instead my first applause goes to acting, generally that Japanese films don't have any brilliant and recited. In MoonChild there is all the cast is simply wonderful and we entered, especially Gackt reflects his emotions and his characters quite well, I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous, as for the part of HYDE, his acting is good, but deliberately remained in the background as an actor, respectively as his character, throughout the film. I didn't like photography, especially lighting and some colors, but due to a limited budget, it still has brilliant moments, but the real jewel of the film is history. It has some sweet moments but that's okay for me, and the movie's friendship theme is very well developed and moving at times, on the other hand the story indicates a cruel world that no life is guaranteed and with some memorable scenes of death reflects this theme to the graphics. An interesting note aside, this film has some similarities with an excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire, also played by the most beautiful actors (not beautiful, beautiful) of American cinema, in reality Moon Child is somehow interpretable as Interwiew's brother , yet original alone. Only one problem with MoonChild is that it's a bit slow sometimes, I'm a fan of Japanese movies and I'm used to it, but it hasn't changed. MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But all in all, this film is really good and very emotional sometimes, as for duo actors / singers I hope to see their other films in the future, and I recommend it to everyone who likes love and science fiction movie of vampires-fiction 8/10
