In a moment in our culture where the reality exposed as narrative is an overbearing fiction as we know it on the small and big screen, "Apart From That" is a film that shows real life moments that feel more honest, fresh and innovative presentation I've never seen it before. The usual spoon feeding conventions do not exist in this film, leaving an audience of content to sit and watch these moments of real life that follow one after another on the screen. While watching the film, and even after contemplation, it's hard to believe that these incredible performances are actually performances. Every moment with the great cast of actors felt like the truth that is exposed in their daily everyday lives. Even so, "Apart From That" does not seem like a documentary or a television reality, but instead transcends a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This film must be seen.
