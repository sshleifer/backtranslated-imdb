Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. It is an ancient piece of ancient China full of martial arts, where the position of an underground den full of traps and prisons marks an important role as the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the set design is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and VHS is almost impossible to wear, even if you are near the second largest city in North America (as I do). If you can find it, don't let it pass.
