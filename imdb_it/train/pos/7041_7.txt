WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> <br /> A hit-and-miss-21st Century "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who co-wrote the screenplay with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser ?? plays a tired hit man called Brand Hauser who is destroyed but decides to follow the last assignment conferring a Middle Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not Omar Sharif but he gets the tone from this misfire for a laugh) commanded by the former Vice President of the United States (Aykroyd, the old co-hort of "Grosse Pointe Blank" by Cusack, making a vulgar meaning of Dick Cheney here), enlisting Brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade Show the producer in mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the private American company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> While being informed, Brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he meets the intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union between Eastern European teen girl Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly respectful Duff who mocks her own celebrity with the cheeky tongue) and the idiot son of the country's leader. <br /> <br /> What follows is a courageous attempt at a black comedy of the 21st century at "DR. STRANGELOVE", but for all the intense and intentions there are unfortunately more errors than blows in this vast attempt at laughter between political message (an unjust war being outsourced by American capitalism, check!) <br /> <br /> While Cusack's riffs on his Martin Blank of the aforementioned "Pointe", adds some nice touches of his man in black ( makes shots of Tabasco sauce to take the edge of the cast), the rest of the cast listens (except for his sister Joan who is a revolt as Hauser's aide-de-camp and has one of the funniest laughs in the film: "My communication skills of mass are finally paying ") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the war in Iraq earlier this year in "Grace Is Gone" at 180 degrees and here he lets his political opinions wear out on his sleeve; while admirable on the whole the rhythm and rhythm of the film are largely not, thanks to the director Joshua Seftel who made his directorial debut here (and it is obvious) except for the well choreographed fight Hauser is involved with the entourage of the idiot boyfriend of Babyyeah. /> <br /> A nice attempt but a wrong failure; maybe next time Cusack won't try so hard and he'll let the idiocy of war speak for himself instead of doing the heavy lifting on his own.
