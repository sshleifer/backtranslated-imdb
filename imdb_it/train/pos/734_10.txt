This movie is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish. The Ramones, the reigning principles of the 70's punk rock, look like themselves. PJ Soles plays Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, his favorite rock band. She keeps school at bay, and encourages her fellow students to join her in her cheering antics. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the school in which Riff participates, has just taken on a new Principal, called Ms. Togar. She is a tall and intimidating woman Amazon. And she swears to make students "linear". He also has a couple of students who act as observers, who bring them back to their classmates with filth. Ms. Togar is particularly determined to capture Riff and put an end to Riff's anarchist scams. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn. Congratulations on the superb interpretation of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary movie actress. And in this film, he plays the fascist Ms. Togar, with a mocking taste. PJ Soles in the role of Riff, turns into an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as Eaglebauer's duplicate, he has a lot of fun with his role. <br /> <br /> The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential, in the punk rock scene of the 70s. Of course, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you don't like Ramones, or Punk Rock, this movie is a fantastic (literally) fun of energetic fun.
