This film was not so well promoted here in Greece, even though it got good actors, excellent script and good photography was not a so-called "blockbuster" movie in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it is the difficult period when a newcomer has to pass when he returns to his native village after being released from a 5-year prison (drugs). The end is pretty sad ... Mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and runs it very well ... Lambropoulou is big and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is once again close to excellence. .. 7 out of 10 because very few Greek films can make such an impression!
