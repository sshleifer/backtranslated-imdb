As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) reluctantly took my younger brother to watch this film, although I secretly hoped it could be East is East II. The trailers seemed fun, so I thought I'd try it. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but then I was glued to the screen, and this had nothing to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too close to the front due to a crowded auditorium. The acting was fresh and vibrant, the characters engaging, and the jokes were really fun. The whole auditorium laughed at every minute. Football fan or football fan, sport has become irrelevant to the basics of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a bit of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, I would dare to say it .... East is better than East. <br /> <br /> This movie trots with a good rhythm, never dwelling on anything more than necessary and leaving nothing incomplete, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. Although it is not a typically round dance film, there are some pleasant surprises on the road and things do not always happen as one would expect. <br /> <br /> Saying that there were elements of predictability, but these were exploited more satirically than used as a script-filler. I suppose, depending on your particular inclination for happy endings, you may be delighted / disappointed by the ending. Personally, if there had been another result I would have written a strongly written letter to the writers. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I'd say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) did the best performance. I never knew that people like that existed, but his realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me that they probably do! The prize for the most convincing (of the main characters) goes, unfortunately, to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but don't get me wrong, she also offered a great performance, it's just that someone has to be the last of the best and sorry Kiera, this one time it's you. <br /> <br /> Tip: do not leave before the credits. Once the lights came back on I realized to my horror that maybe I shouldn't have watched this movie after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice. Oh, what I'm saying, it was absolutely fantastic and I can't recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and I will add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I explain only if it's really worth it.
