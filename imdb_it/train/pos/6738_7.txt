But towards the end, he has but not before falling in love with a woman who meets who is the lover of the person who killed ... <br /> <br /> The cast includes Dana Andrews (As the city sleeps, Curse of the Demon), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (Streets of San Francisco, Beyond Posidon's Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Cape). Good parts from all. <br /> <br /> Where it's worth going to Sidewalk End if you get the chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
