This film is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's film). But it's a less glamorous story and more in the face. And of course here is not the father, but his grandfather who tells the stories. <br /> <br /> Even the narrative of the film moves back and forth (so the plot here at IMDb, could tell you more than you would like to read, before watching the film). It's fun and engaging, even if you switch from one story to another and even in dramatic moments. It surprises you here and there too, with things you would not expect. A nice little movie then, that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : OR)
