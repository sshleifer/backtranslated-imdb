Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman: Dead End that only helps stimulate our taste buds and leaves us wanting more! This is what a real superhero movie should look like! Also tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. Attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although it is a production of limited resources, it embarrasses the "other" productions related to superheroes with limited budgets. Here the main and supporting characters act and seem to be real life people. Finally a Superman that looks really "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman as it should be, without the ostentatious rubberized and torn rubber armor to hide the scarce physicists for the highest paid actors who do not deliver. I just hope an exaggerated Warner Bros. performer gives the OK to produce an integral adaptation of this jewel. I don't care if it goes to the movies or directly to DVDs, I would never get tired of watching it. Only the plot itself deserves my hard work for it. I hope that the "big guys" of the Marvel and DC productions will take a look and see what a real well-made superhero film should look like. No more fiasco of "Batman & Robin", or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little directors of the time and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero of the film, only to have it "bombed" in theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
