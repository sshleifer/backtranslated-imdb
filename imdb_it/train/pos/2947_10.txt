If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing. The first time you do it, you'll be literally sore lying on the floor vomiting from laughing so hard, and probably even wet yourself. <br /> <br /> It's so much fun. There was not a single comic performance on this date that I saw that this is the maximum, or even is approaching. So many classic, stories and segways. <br /> <br /> The drunken uncle at the barbecue, Gi Joe, Mr T, goo goo goo, ice-cream maker, you say one of these things to anyone I've seen this show and I'll bet dollars on donuts that won't be able to keep be serious and burst out laughing, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Too bad you can't have it on the DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rated 10+ out of 10
