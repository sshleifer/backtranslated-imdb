I found this movie really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a white body from the mid-1950s. He does not realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as before. Listen to rap music, sing and play the stereotypical part of an urban colored man. The real humor in this film was looking at the problem that this behavior involves him in the black community.
