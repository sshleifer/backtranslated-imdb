The playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had a series of flop comedies after a great success. He receives a play written by a student of his, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) which is fantastic. It's so beautiful that Sidney says he'd kill for it. He will do it? <br /> <br /> The thriller of a thinking man. Originally it was a game ... and show. It's mainly on a set and everyone talks but I've never been bored. It is very well written with many twists and a good cast working at full speed. Caine is as fantastic as Bruhl, another of his great interpretations. Reeve is, surprisingly, very good. I've never thought much about him as an actor, but he's really good at it. Dyan Cannon does miracles with a role signed as the wife of Bruhls. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) like Helga ten Drop, a psychic. However, his accent got on my nerves. The director Sidney Lumet does very well with his one set. The camera is always in motion and keeps the attention going. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILERS DIED IN ADVANCE !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this film turn out to be furious sociopaths and also contains one of the least romantic kisses I've ever seen - but these are slight complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have completely disappeared since its debut in 1982. Too bad, it deserves better.
