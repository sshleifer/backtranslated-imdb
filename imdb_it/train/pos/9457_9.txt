How can we sum up exactly how good, right and touching this film is? For several weeks this DVD jumped off the shelf every time I entered the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films before, I didn't want to smear my thoughts on him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it with a 'What the hell!' attitude! And how surprised I was! I just wish I had bought it before. After watching it three times in two days, I am still smiling about how the portrait of a widower struggling with three daughters, eager for what is missing from the passage of his beloved wife, who thus meets a charming woman, captivating her in such a deep interesting (dare I say libertine?), throws a completely different light on life that makes him understand that it is what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> The hitch of that woman who is his sister girl complicates matters - which portray Dan comically shy and with sincere displeasure, seeing his "someone special" that brings so much fun and enjoyment into the house of family, as well as in the lives of his brothers. You have just started trying for him. <br /> <br /> Then, when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - this is the turning point in Dan's estimate of Dan !! The look she gives him when she repeats her comment, about not enjoying Ruthie - Sheer Green-Eyed Monster! Unleash an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well done, as Dan starts to relax regarding Marie. <br /> <br /> More extravagant scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, faced by his brothers, starts to describe what just happened .... when Dan's face goes down it brings a strong influx! ! <br /> <br /> The younger daughter Lilly who celebrates her love for Suzanne, his late wife, brings a small gift of sincere warmth and a small sip while Dan realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings at the Talent Show .... his voice cracks slightly as he takes up the song. ... absolute jewel! <br /> <br /> The acceptance of what happens late in the film by his daughters ... all three love their father and want to see him happy, they will not allow him to deny his love for Marie; the desperation of Dan not to abandon his daughters because it is their rock, their fortress ... and I will tell them much more in a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I'll leave for now - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future .... but I'll finish by saying ... <br /> <br /> ... if you want to watch a movie this is just so damn nice, with comedy twists to lighten the drama, which never feels forced or coarse, which looks like a genuine portrait of a man who discovers a new life - not only with a woman but also with her extended family, so look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for a cinematic experience so well rendered with a soundtrack by Sondre Lerche, which takes you intimately anywhere without ever being intrusive, with a fine show by the cast of ensemble. I can't wait to see him again !!
