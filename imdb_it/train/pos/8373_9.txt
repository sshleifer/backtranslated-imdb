Note to previous reviewer: This film is "science fiction adaptation of the Iliad" according to the screenwriter. So if the references are painful or not, we apologize, it's the basis for the film. They admit to having stolen ... even if adapted the P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Great flick but too short. He probably didn't come out as the author, director or studio he wanted, but it was really fun. The fact that the study itself has imploded during construction only adds to its legacy. <br /> <br /> A big budget remake wouldn't be so fun and probably wouldn't make the script more justice. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. A DVD version with some meager extras is apparently available, but I don't think it would play on NTSC players. I'm not an expert and I'm still trying to figure it out. For now, I live with the VHS incarnation.
