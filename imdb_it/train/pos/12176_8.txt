Paul (Jason Lee) is an underachi who is just engaged to a type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily schedule. At his bachelor party, Paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) back to his excavations. "Nothing happened," as they say, but the two wake up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. He's going to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul pushes Becky out, even if his underwear is left behind. But there's even more fun. At a family dinner at Karen's parents' house, Paul again bumps into Becky, learning that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanations to do! But instead, Paul chooses to fake a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night instead of Paul? And what will the consequences be? I'm sorry for the critics who film pan like this. They should definitely clear, because this film is fresh and fun. Of course, it doesn't hurt things that Lee is a fun and consummate man, Stiles is a charming beauty or Blair is a pretty but anal girlfriend. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also quite nice. The appearance of the film is wonderful, as are the costumes and settings of California. The best thing is that the script is imaginative and inspired, creating great laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones, take this movie tonight. It may not be an Academy Award material, but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a damn good one.
