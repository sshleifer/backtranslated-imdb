This is an exquisite film about finding some bliss in everyday life. The rhythm, the camera work, the emotion, the musical score and the pure charm of this image make it a must see. It is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted. The only flaw I can see on this film is that it was not captured in a more technically perfect movie format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the best sound format available. (An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeters.) The splendid Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have made it even more luxuriant and the small beautiful moments would be even more wonderfully seen and heard. As it stands, it still requires attention like a small moving film. I can't stop myself from watching him every time he arrives on the satellite. The transformations of the characters from content, narrow and wary are always a joy to look at and I should really recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> The casting is perfect, the atmosphere is perfect, the acting is above every reproach. It's a film about middle age and the choices people make. He is deep and meditated without beating the spectator with a heavy hand. Watch it at once and let it have its effect on you. If you don't understand, maybe you haven't lived long enough, or something else is wrong with you.
