If I had just seen the pilot of this show I would have considered it as a 10. I was immediately conquered by this wonderful new world. The subsequent episodes were not completely up to the promise, but I will continue to watch and hope that it continues to improve. Production values ​​are incredible and acting is top notch. I don't mind that it doesn't seem to be perfectly in line with BSG because I'm so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, it's two different shows. I am happy that both Esai Morales and one of my favorites of all time, Eric Stoltz, are back in my life (even if only weekly) because I missed them both. This is a show that requires some reflection from its audience and that is always a good thing. You should wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in the lines of the plot, in the characters and, of course, in the various virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey seems to be a nice ride.
