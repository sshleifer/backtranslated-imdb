*** SPOILERS *** In the throes of hatred and half-breed revenge, Zach Provo, James Coburn, had spent the last 11 years in a chain gang planning his escape. What Provo wants is more than freedom is also the score with the man who captured him and in the process, during a wild shootout, he killed his wife Navajo: the former sheriff of Pima county Sam Burgade, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Fleeing after killing two prison guards, Provo heads for Yuma knowing that it is not only the place where Burgade lives, but where his daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey, also resides. Using his companions who fled to convince Burgade in the vast Arizona desert, promising them $ 30,000.00 in gold coins he buried there, Provo intends to expose his bloody revenge on Burgade. But only after having seen him testify that his daughter is brutally raped by his fellow prisoners or, not being with a woman for years, excited like a rabbit during the mating season! <br /> <br /> A brutal and very effective Westerner who updates the 1956 John Wayne classic "The Searchers" in a father who searches dangerous territory for his kidnapped daughter. Charlton Heston as guilty Sam Burgade in his slaughter somehow responsible for killing Provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter Susan is perfect in the role of the retired senior sheriff . Even Charles Coburn as the vindictive means Zach Provo is at his best as obsessed with hatred and murder escaped the condemned. <br /> <br /> The man who fled with Provo really has no interest in his personal affairs but has no choice as he knows the territory like the back of his hand, but to go with him. It is only the thought that they have their way with Susan, when Provo gives them the go ahead, as well as the buried $ 30,000.00 in gold coins that prevents them from parting and going their own way. <br /> <br /> together with Burgade is Susan's fianc√©, Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, who ultimately proves to be as good as Burgade, who felt he didn't have it in him, either to track down escaped criminals or to use common sense, which in this case is missing in Burgade, in doing so. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** The incredibly brutal and bloodstained clash between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to bear. Provo, who hated Burgade bordered on the right madness, wanted him to suffer a slow and heartbreaking death. it was that hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and, after taking half a dozen bullets, he ended up putting the thirsty and bloodthirsty, as well as unreasonable, mad ones on the run forever!
