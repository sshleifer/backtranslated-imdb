I am a bit conflicted about this. The show is a terrible part, the acting is terrible (even when we get real actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode), the dialogue is morally and the premise / morale of each episode seems something raised by a 50s Teacher . There is no way you will be frightened for a moment by one of these episodes, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, useless and banal in a sort of Bob Saget on America's Home Video's most fun ways. <br /> <br /> On the other hand this is one of the funniest things I've ever been on television. The fashions of the 80s, the soft focus makes the actors always like them on the set of The View at all times, the premises lend the material more to self-parody than to fears, so we remain with an episode in which a boy high school is afraid that if her SAT fails her girlfriend will dump her and her parents will deny him, another is afraid that she will be locked up in prison because she is a poor mother (her husband is played by Brad Pit), another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another is afraid of being confused with his socially retarded twin, another is afraid that if he does not break his mother and his stepfather will get him killed for a party at his house. The list could go on and on. <br /> <br /> Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look beyond the points and devices of the ridiculous plot, but they are so out of the left field that there are no opportunities for writers to actually scare the public. You have characters dressed as something from a 80s themed nightmare that wanders around offering bad dialogues in a very funny way and making illogical decisions that do not serve any other purpose than to move the plot to the next plot point ( usually looking at something unusual for a healthy person as a peripheral character, while our main character is stunned and too shocked to do something about it. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something that scares you, stay away. you are looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80's ever. I watch it. <br /> <br /> He has performed on Chiller TV lately (practically every day) and I was watching it , first for morbid curiosity, and now just to have a good laugh every day With Arrested Development and Extra off the air this is officially the most fun thing on television right now.
