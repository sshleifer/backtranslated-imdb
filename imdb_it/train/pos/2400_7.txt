I see what my ancestors saw in the young Bette Davis. She is splendid in this almost crazy political comedy that actually sees Warren Williams as the political agent constantly behind her food. Vivienne Osborne is as brilliant as her ex, and I found myself rooting for her. The Williams character is not at all nice, and he is not even a good candidate. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate dragged out of his sleep to a political convention and appointed governor to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, so this whole mess is brought about by an internal political war in a party called "Progressive Party". If you are of a political mind, you will probably see a different party than the one you are affiliated with, reflected in Williams and Kibbee's "Progressive Party" imagery. I could draw exact parallels, but we're not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever seen one of Wheeler & Woolsey's old titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, like Williams's right hand man, who looks and behaves very much like Bert Wheeler. It made me fooled. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this.
