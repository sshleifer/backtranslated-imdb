Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it badly would like to refer to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and gave him 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect, or spectacular, but I liked it. A Chorus Line is not so much a story, as it is a group of stories about the life of Broadway hopes. I read the reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie. This is an incorrect view. It's another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of Broadway's hopes. What people fail to understand is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things that goes through the common man. And I think it's really the point of the whole show. It is to show not only the talent of these special dancers, but to give us some moving things to think about in life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because it has gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points, and sometimes gets confused a bit with the rhythm of certain plots, but all in all, I liked it a lot. Take a closer look at the film, and then maybe you'll understand what I'm talking about.
