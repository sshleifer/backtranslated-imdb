This is the first film by Tom Hanks that I had the privilege of seeing in the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard he was going to play an assassin, I was a little dizzy thinking "Mr. Hanks can get him out"? And he did it in high fashion. The 1930s depression film talks about loyalty, redemption and a path where you don't want your children to fall to the ground. Tom Hanks is the star of a stellar cast like Michael Sullivan. Being the family man, and the secret life of the contract killer for Oscar nominee Paul Newman. This film, Tom Hanks, is based more on reaction and look than on dialogue, which offers a direct elimination performance. <br /> <br /> In one night of one of his works, Michael's son Michael Jr., played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, bears witness to the blow. And Michael Sr.'s scene partner, scene mate Daniel Craig, can't get this information. He then takes out Michael Sr.'s son and wife, except Michael Jr. So they go to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Paul Newman, Mr. Rooney). <br /> <br /> The drama and the intense plot thickens as a father to fix things, even if the son is around. During this deadly journey, someone took a success for Michael Sr. The murderer would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a stained Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The film will make you feel old times. And with the beautiful and obsessed Thomas Newman soundtrack, you can't help but appreciate this film by Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. So sit back and enjoy the wild journey.
