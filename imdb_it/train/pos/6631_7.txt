I have no idea how to describe this film, and I would also like to offer others the same opportunity I had - seeing it without any previous knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it immensely, but I can also say that I hardly understood what was happening, if in reality there was something to understand in the first place. David Lynch fans (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin's films should particularly appreciate it, and all fans of the EIGHTBALL comic will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder (it was as close as possible to any movie I saw humor Dan Clowes creates so effectively). <br /> <br /> A small note to warn anyone easily offended: this film, if evaluated, would surely be NC-17. Fans of male full-frontal nudity, anyway ... hmm, well ... yes. This is a strange wild stuff.
