The actors perform wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's great that Robin Williams played Osiric's comedy role, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in such a production. It's really nice that Kenneth has decided to use the most complete version of the text, this is certainly not too often ... Thanks to this, viewers can see everything, not the parts chosen by the director. Moreover, thank God, the film is in a classic form; NO to surreal fanfabetics! Although "Tytus Andronico" was still impressive, but still Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view.
