I'm very sorry for the people who go to the movies with a notebook and a pencil to write down defects and keep notes on how bad a film is. I also feel contempt for people who go to the cinema and CANNOT suspend reality and / or allow themselves to enjoy their boring or busy lives 90 minutes! Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a very funny film. If you take movies seriously, this is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to look like the book in ANY way, this is not for you. But if you liked the hilarity of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or "what the hell I'm looking at" of Moulin Rouge. Or the coarse comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" So let Cowgirls escape. It has some really fun parts. Really fun. He also has good music, kudos to kd.lang. I also said that he has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... should I add anything else?
