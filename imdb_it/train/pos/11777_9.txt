"Jared Diamond pointed out in the first episode that other peoples of the world did not have animals to tame, but Europeans did, and this explains why we were able to manufacture steel and invent complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. Please don't ruin this great piece with your simple mind. The reasons are much more complex than the single thing you mentioned. Please read the book as it is a great source of information. I loved it. This book is even taught as a textbook in some universities.
