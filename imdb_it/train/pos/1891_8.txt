When you see this film you begin to realize how a drastically underutilized resource was the late Dudley Moore. There should be a dozen films like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was already a first-rate talent before he went to Hollywood, both comedian and musician. But above all he is remembered for his combination with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of these was 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> He has always tended to be eclipsed by Cook, whose jealousy and pettiness have split their partnership and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in America. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. Moore's clown comedy as a drunk is undeniable. The script fits his manners perfectly with a series of hilarious, almost surreal conversationalists. There is something so British about him that I am really surprised to have found such charm in American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian who followed the same trend, tended to draw a void. It's Moore's almost childlike vulnerability that is so captivating. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play straight roles against him, but still have some good jokes. In particular, John Guilgud delivers his with a sarcastic and immature authority that is a treasure to watch. Invariably he steals every scene in which he presents himself and fully deserves his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up film called "Arthur 2 - On The Rocks". It never reaches the same sublime levels of fun that it achieves, but it is still quite good even so. Guilgud only gets a cameo at the beginning and like a ghost. It's darker And there's some interesting inner research. It will be disappointing if you look first at "Arthur". <br /> <br /> Hollywood seems to have lost interest in Dudley, a cuddle after these two releases. Eventually he returned to Britain, downcast and seemingly dying. <br /> <br /> But "Arthur" is an example of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great films he should have made. <br /> <br /> You're sadly missed, Dudley.
