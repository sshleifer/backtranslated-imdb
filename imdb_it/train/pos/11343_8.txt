I remember seeing him on TV in the late 70s - and he stayed with me! It's fascinating, strong, colorful - a fantastic children's movie. I wore it for some friends at a party recently - and of course they thought I was crazy and I expected something bad to happen to the puppets at "Meet the flebles" But no - its clean and healthy fun. <br /> <br /> jack wild is in excellent shape, as is mom cass and the attractive witch poop. <br /> <br /> If you like bananas and you're in your thirties, this recreates the surreal childhood on a Saturday morning atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Although I understand now that Pouf is a bit disgusting - like all it does is capture and escape! Quality TV movies - if, like me, you're in death metal, you'll love it!
