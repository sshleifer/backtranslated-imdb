I've been waiting a long time for this film since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, played by three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And although it was directed by Harold Becker, who did an irregular job, he and Pacino combined on SEA OF LOVE, which ranks among their best works. But the interferences on some levels (for beginners, many of the scenes in the original trailer do not appear in the film) and the change of tone (the subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, while watchable, anywhere like it could have been . <br /> <br /> Which is a shame, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how the government can still be worth it despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about that corruption, not the usual good guys against the bad guys. And there's good acting here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello offers one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is wasted in his role, having nothing to do, and while there is a merit in the central plot, when he turns into a thriller, the film loses its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then it falls down completely at the end. I wish I could enjoy it more, but no.
