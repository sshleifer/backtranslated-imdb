If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to an amiable wanderer and get your laugh out of laughter, look at something else. If, however, you love slapstick comedy played by one of the best, look at this. <br /> <br /> The image is of the tramp who cannot really conquer the girl. He sees another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has an explosion that ruins their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "park comedies" filmed in the park of Mack Sennett, with pickpockets, policemen and couples. These short films work because the format allows Chaplin to shine while moving through difficult situations. I checked the box, as this could be considered a spoiler, even if it's not if you've seen these movies. Everyone ends up in the pond except Chaplin. He gets the girl, who in this case was played by Minta Durfee, a.k.a. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
