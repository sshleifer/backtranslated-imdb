I gave this film 10 not because it's a superbly coherent film, but because of its sheer ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of a woman's struggle against all odds is now an old clich√©, but very few films have carried it forward with such cordiality and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> showed a different side of the African-American experience - showing that after the slaves gained freedom many fell into the ways of the hated "white man" and were offensive to their same people. I find this to be an important point as it goes against the trend of white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar portraits. <br /> <br /> Even the performances are excellent - especially Oprah which I now have a new respect for. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at - but keep some paper handy.
