Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are "Three Smart Girls" in this 1936 Universal film, which introduces Deanna Durbin in filming the audience. He also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, who now live in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who feel that their father (Winninger) is still marrying. Not seeing him for 10 years and knowing that his mother still loves him, they board a ship in America, with the help of the housekeeper / nanny, determined to stop the marriage. Realizing that the intention, called "Precious" (Barnes), is nothing but a gold digger helped and favored by her mother (Brady), who have her present a rich count. This is organized by the accountant of their father (the king). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for a rich count (Milland). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary, with some fine performances, especially from Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are nice and they all do a good job. The emphasis, of course, is on the young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a well-trained singer. In fact, his youthful voice is much more uniform than he would be as an adult - he has no problems with high notes, as he did later because he put too much weight in the middle voice. Sing a delicious "Il Bacio" in a police station. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is to see his father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and knows them. Barnes as the gold digger is not so young, but the girls' mother looks up there, so the inference was probably the oldest man who was looking for his youth with a younger and more charming woman. In fact, he finds the youth he sought in his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin the accumulation of a big star here - it has the final version of the movie. Ray Milland was still paying his dues at this point, and it will probably be a surprise even for movie fans how young and attractive he is. <br /> <br /> Very funny and, of course, this led to a sequel and great celebrity for Deanna.
