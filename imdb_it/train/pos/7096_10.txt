I had the privilege of watching this film in a preview showing years ago, and outside the theater I found myself in front of a TV crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At that time, the only words that escaped my mouth were: "Fantastic, simply fantastic". I like to think of being able to articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was a bit incapable of doing it. <br /> <br /> The plot is intriguing and inspiring, and the acting is of top quality from all the principals. This film was the first in which Terry Gilliam directed not to have a hand for written credit. Back with Universal after his long and arduous battle with them on "Brazil", Terry had achieved what he wanted most; final version ". Terry is a master craftsman, and every shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been carefully constructed, with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be free in his attempts to convey a concept. , there are still limitations in these agreements. <br /> <br /> The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed on the package. It contains, among other things, an audio commentary by the director / producer and an extremely interesting 90-minute informative documentary on the making of the film "The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys". they were badly tested, hitting the team with feelings of insecurity and despair, fortunately for all of us , they decided to change the film very little and made it a huge success. <br /> <br />
