Although sometimes the plot was a bit mushy, and VERY rushed to the end, as if the director had run out of time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was good enough for the for-Backwoods - TV-gender difference. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see more of them around the cinema. Even the music was well done, getting every possible chill out from the dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think "JAWS") music-based build-up type. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm "I want to see" While the kids are sleeping "again, but if I did, it would be focusing on the execution of the talented Klaveno.
