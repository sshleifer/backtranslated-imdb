This is the film I've seen more than any other (I think I've seen it on average once a year since its release). And every time I see it, it's equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was probably a combination of the best that has ever been in the ex-Yu film industry. This film is an absolute must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a movie poker that everyone should have in his private video collection.
