This documentary has been broadcast on RTE and BBC in recent months. Having seen it twice, I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the production of media and documentaries. <br /> <br /> Initially this documentary was intended to describe the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew set off with these intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is surprising when they witness first-hand the attempted overthrow of the rebel factions (especially the oil concerns in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government. What the public is witnessing is the way in which the media manipulate the situation and in fact hinder the overthrow of Chavez by distorting events that occur when the coup increases. <br /> <br /> It's really an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers. <br /> <br />
