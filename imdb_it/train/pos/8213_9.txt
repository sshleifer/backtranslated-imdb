Anyone who is a witness of our judicial system or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. There were not too many shades of gray regarding the characters or the plot. Virtually every character in this film has embodied the best and worst of our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that many of us, at one time or another, have had to deal with pranksters, bureaucrats with open mouths and disheveled hair that enhance them in the name of "politics". correctness ". <br /> <br /> Performance across the board was compelling. I sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same time, I found it gratifying to see her dry up the arrogant, arrogant arrogance from the faces of her former attackers In particular, I found the dam one of the ugliest characters in all the movies I've seen, so it was good to see his former victim shut up forever, the main rapist and the psychopath were equally ugly, so it was right that the same Dirty Harry had offended him in a grotesque way in the end.This was the only sequel to Harry's dirty saga that equaled the first.
