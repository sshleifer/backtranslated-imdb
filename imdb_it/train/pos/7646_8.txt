This film is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I made and how my life would have changed if my choices had been different. Play directly in the "Multiple Universe" theory. <br /> <br /> The only thing that doesn't sound real is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has trouble understanding what's going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
