Bruce Almighty, one of the best photos of Carrey from ... well ... for a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and also the chips in some jokes that are surprisingly fun. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but above all a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene in, is where Jim is messing up the anchor man's voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
