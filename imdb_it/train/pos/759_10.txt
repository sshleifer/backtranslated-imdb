For many people, Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative about hip hop culture. <br /> <br /> Young Lee lives in New York in the 1980s when hip hop was in its infancy. He is a member of the "Beat Street" crew, a b-boy team. The film follows Lee on his average day, dancing, scratching, etc. <br /> <br /> The director managed to make a film with a plot and at the same time present hip hop to the rest of the world. The film has old school features like the Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force, the Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers and many others .... <br /> <br /> Neither the film Beat Street nor the spirit of Beat Street will ever die.
