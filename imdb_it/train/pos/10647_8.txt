I can't understand what fans of the genre didn't like this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with the reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited for the video to come home, which I felt was another reason why I wouldn't like the movie. I think movies with special effects should be seen on the big screen, but again it wasn't. For me the film asks for comparison with two films that were released in the same period. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror movie of all time. The mummy made a lot of money and was pure disaster. People liked it for its special effects. Movies like Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse. Well, with that analogy the Mummy was a ticket B for Haunting's E-ticket.
