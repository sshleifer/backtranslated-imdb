I LOVE Jack's lines like "The cliché is ..." or "Above the cliché top, black, oily skin, a bit spooky ...". It's simply hilarious! Daniel is starting to reach him! Good thing, Jack is no longer on the team (in a sense), otherwise it would have been a craze for sarcasm !!!! I love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I must admit), the characters are fantastic, the actors are fantastic, I'm starting to take facial expressions (and not only) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! They go again !!! Sorry, I'm also starting to collect the traits from Carter, and all this is driving my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they continue to make the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !
