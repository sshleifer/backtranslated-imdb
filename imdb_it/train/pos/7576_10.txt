The third and final episode of "Hanzo il Rasoio" is the most concrete of all. The training is also completed in the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's borrowed loan surveys carried out by an order of blind monks. He also makes a historical comment on the proud refusal of the old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a fun and bloody ride with little connection to the plot, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" manages to connect everything, and brings everything home at the end. Definitely the perfect ending. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of useless blood and violence (after all it's * Hanzo the Razor).
