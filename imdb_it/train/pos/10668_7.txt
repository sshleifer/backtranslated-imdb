As many reviewers have noted, the film version differs a lot from the theatrical version of the story. I have never seen the theatrical version of the story, so I have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still a fun account of several dancers trying to make the big moment in the choreographer's show Michael Douglas. The film does well not to select any actor or actor famous for ending up in the final test group. In this way our attention is focused on the movements of the dancers and on the stories and individual struggles that take place during a day of marathon testing. Douglas is probably not the best choice for the part. Apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one, and the backstage story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added. I have to honestly say that this was the weakest part of the film. The repeated intrusions that Cassie made during the attempts seem to reflect the almost desperate pleas that often have to be done when engaging in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film was made to die in the past, and it is curious to see this old and tired shoe once again tread the heel. The revelations of the dancers themselves started out quite promising with the number "I can do that", but then trudged a bit at various points while the dancers told their stories. Frankly, their stories differed little from people in real life who never had a chance like this. *** of 4 stars.
