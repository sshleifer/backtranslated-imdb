This is a fantastic and ridiculous horror film that captures the essence of the obsession from the mid to late 1980s of the way in which metal evil music was supposedly. I remember being frightened by the metal boys when I was a child. It doesn't help that I found a tomb desecrated in my town's cemetery when I was ten. It turns out that this strange metal boy has dug old bodies and used their bones in some strange sacrifice for satan. So maybe stuff like that has discouraged me from metal for a while, but now I love it, at 24. <br /> <br /> I bought this used DVD for 6 dollars and I expected it to suck because of the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled. It's about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you have to love a scene where a guitar shoots at the lazers and vaporizes the bombs in the crowd. This movie is fantastic, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this is for you. 9/10!
