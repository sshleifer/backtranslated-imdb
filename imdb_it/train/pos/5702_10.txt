I didn't expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that he wasn't the porn legend himself. In fact, the whole cast has had incredible performances in this largely underrated film. <br /> <br /> As some have already said, look for the set of two discs and watch the documentary "Wadd" first; will give you a lot of information about the story that will be useful to appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> Some people seem unhappy with the LAPD crime scene video included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons why he may have been included, one of which is that the John Holmes murder trial was the first in the United States where the footage was used by the prosecution. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" in the menu!
