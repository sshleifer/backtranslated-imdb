Having seen Peter O'Toole's version recently, I was ready to be impressed by the clever writing of this version. Little time is devoted to combat, which I prefer. Instead, we are shown all the many reasons behind both the French and the English (who held Normandy) politicians and priests who put her to death. Even the worst hypocrite of them all, the archbishop, leaves us with the thought that "Of course, she was innocent, the innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the powerful." He had no idea what he was saying, no idea of ​​the implications of blasphemy or going against the church. Not sculpted, he had no idea what the church's position was on such matters. "<br /> <br /> Preminger was faithful to the myths surrounding his death, and I appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames rising and burning. Why? They used jets of gas in the film and 2 of them they were stopped. Suddenly, the air pressure blew on the interruption and the flames rose just above her, luckily for her, they didn't have to repeat the shot because it was so realistic: she was burned !! Introduction traumatic for an Iowa girl to her new acting career. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud performed exceptionally well, and it is the English politician who is orchestrating the show, which also makes the point that once I condemn someone to death, you don't want to be around to see them die. You could withdraw from your "duty" next time ... not that such delicacies annoy the soul of our aspiring president. resort to the Old Testament when it comes to capital punishment, even if it was bypassed by the words of Jesus. Give public executions like this child. The smell of burnt meat could bring us respectable people for the senses of our souls. <br /> <br /> The only small "choice" I have of this film is that we are not shown why the priest who was so adamant about pushing it to burn becomes so suddenly so contrite, to the point of madness. There should have been more expansion of his character, more dialogue - because the sudden 'coming into himself' makes no sense. <br /> <br /> And, if Graham Greene does it deliberately or not, St. Joan is such a small, confident but almost not at all, I'm glad you meet him. And when he refused life in prison, for some reason I thought of Anne Sexton, the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of "stealing her death" when she committed suicide ... knowing that such an action guarantees immortality . You must be amazed !! <br /> <br /> If ever there was a good example of obsessive thinking and tight compartments of logic, this is one. Santa Giovanna was supposed to become a Buddhist and calm the "voices in her mind".
