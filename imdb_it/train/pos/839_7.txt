Think of Pierce Brosnan and think he is a suave, elegant, intelligent James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against the guy - and enjoys doing it (as well as the audience). This is a movie about a hired assassin who makes friends with a tormented businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a funny film, with very good scenes (a compelling Brosnan on the board and a Kinnear, good, respectful, "out", has good lines). My only quibble is that Hope Davis, playing the tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Does not appear more often: it could have been a wonderful film for these men. <br /> <br /> This film is like a matador: it plays with the public, while "it is going to kill". The ending is fantastic because a plot emerges (with a positive moral!): This is a fast-paced, frenetic and fun film that deserves a large audience.
