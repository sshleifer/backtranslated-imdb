This film contains more action before the opening titles than in all Hollywood movies of this type. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and starring Jet Li. This team brought you many Hong Kong-style film productions, including the Once Upon A Time series in China. The action was swift and furious with an incredible thread work. I only saw the wires in two shots. Apart from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as a filler. To find other action films that can compete with this, you need to find a Hong Kong cinema in your area. It is really worth a try and usually never disappoints.
