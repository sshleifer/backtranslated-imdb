For God, it's been a long time since I saw it. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells us (guys) all about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally put together - Disney-style animation, in addition to human actors - it was directed by Frank Capra, for heaven's sake! <br /> <br /> Type of overkill. I wonder if the very high production value is worth what equals the value of a strip of film on the human body? But the children will see him learn: even now I can clearly remember that Dr. Baxter has been challenged by the same Hemo to name which common material looks more like human blood, to which the Doctor immediately replies "sea water".
