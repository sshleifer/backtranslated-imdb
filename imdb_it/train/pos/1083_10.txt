Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A performance worthy of consideration by Oscar, once again avoided by the academy. Mr. Grant runs the range from silly to tender in this wonderful play about a man who decides to move out of the big city. The pitfalls of building a house are well documented and have become the basis (freely) of the most modern vehicle Tom Hanks, "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you like good old-fashioned comedy without the curse and free sex, this movie is a must see.
