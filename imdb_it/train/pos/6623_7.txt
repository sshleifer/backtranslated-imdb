First of all, this film is painfully beautiful. A person who works on 3D CG films like a lighter / composer, the images shocked me. Every moment I was amazed by what was on the screen. As for the story, well, that's fine. It won't light up the world, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner-esquire story (and who doesn't?) Then you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I must say that I felt that the speaking voice was particularly bland and distracted from the film as a whole. I saw it in the cinema in English, but I hope there is a French version that floats somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
