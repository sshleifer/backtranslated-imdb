This is a great movie if seen in the right context - It was meant to be a parody of adoration movies for kids-horror-devil (and the 80s saw quite a few)! I saw this movie when it came out, and I immediately liked it. Being a big KISS fan, it was great to see Gene in the film. And anything with OZZY as a preacher who hates metal can't be bad at all! Furthermore, Fastway was already one of my favorites, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (this was pre-DVD) for Trick or Treat contained an illustration of Sammi on her knees, playing her guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" to watch. It was a special order, and the price for the VHS copy at the time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. The "OZZY-Gene" cover was created only for the $ 5 re-release. Probably the company that released it had imagined that Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the film, so it was better to put them on the cover! The same thing with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for all five minutes, but now they have it on the cover as if it were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick or Treat" website, and it's surprising how many people believe that Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped to perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to "Sammi Curr". <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it was a good time, a rock-n-roll movie. Definitely not to be taken too seriously, but simply enjoyed!
