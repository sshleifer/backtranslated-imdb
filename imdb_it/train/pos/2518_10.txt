This is, for all categories, the best film I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their films are always sucked - that's art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who detests what he has become and lives by denying it. His desire for a final death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from different Asian countries live. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the film. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, you are excited, sad, happy ... Never has a film touched me like this film does. And the actors are fantastic - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without sounding strange. A great praise to the publisher for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> A final comment on this brilliant film is that he sees Gackt (former singer of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (singer of L'Arc ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent roles such as Sho and Kei. I am amazed how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting according to the age in which he is acting. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you never see films, see Moon Child, the crow (Brandon Lee) and the new masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All in their original languages, of course!
