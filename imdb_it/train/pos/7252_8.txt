I saw this film before joining the British army. I followed my basic training, initially difficult and then I progressed much more easily. My time was spent during the height of the problems in the NI and the cold war. There have been times when I wondered about what I had gotten myself into, not for a long time, since the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. The above item used to show what the soldiers are thinking is apt, although I would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pulsate in the eardrum in certain situations. A few years later I was in Canada for a family together. A my aunt who lives in the United States and is a lecturer at the Columbus Uni Ohio had made a document on the effects of the British army in NI. He spent some time out there doing research. Although ex pat was very anti-British. He made a bee line for me and he condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer was to see the movie "A long day is dying". It is the closest that a civilian can understand why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
