This is a silent film better than the average and worth seeing if you are a fan of the silent ones. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try some other films before watching this. This is because the plot looks rather outdated and hard to believe in commercials. But despite this, it is still a good film and has kept my interest. <br /> <br /> A nice lady unfortunately connected to the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film begins five years later, after she came to understand that he is indeed a brutal thief. Despite this, he tries to make the best of it and does not dwell on how beautiful life was before this idiot entered his life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. Become a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a deal. Unfortunately, the lady who was trying to connect a potential customer with a dinner cannot make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely for the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now - since she's actually married and the new guy wants to marry her ?! Well, watch the movie yourself to see how everything is solved. I DON'T LIKE how they managed the husband, as it seemed terribly predictable and clich√©. However, once he gets out of the way, I admire that the film DID NOT give up a final by numbers and left the film with few conclusions. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very beautiful film to watch, but certainly not exceptional.
