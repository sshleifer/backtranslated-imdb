This is widely seen in Australia as one of the best detective movies ever produced here ... and for my money, everywhere. It's raw, gritty, the characters are real, situations are credible and don't shy away from the darker side of life faced by cops and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their various orbits every day. > <br /> This show lasted 2 seasons and was interrupted because the show did not sell well overseas. We are all sorry for his loss: however, like Fawlty Towers, we will be able to honor it as a series of uniformly high-quality limited length.
