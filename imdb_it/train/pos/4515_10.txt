That movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you look at it with your friends it can be a nice day ... Of course you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and played (Tomba / Unziker that couple), and this is probably the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy it very. We looked at it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first ones, when the criminals kill Alex's friend, and he tries to behave like a desperate man, and the result is a first-class comic scene ... And then when he shows Leva (Antevleva, what a name) the "Palassio di giusstissia", and then the Leva incident, which once is driving out of the street, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What a magic!
