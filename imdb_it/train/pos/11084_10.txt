<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine - I bothered my parents to bring me back three times. I started looking for it on the video about five years ago, finally discovering a copy on an online auction site, but I'd like to see it picked up by a new distributor and reread (I understand the original video was small), or have the rights acquired by The Family Channel, Disney, etc. and shown regularly. It is a fascinating film that throws you into the story of the fight of a fox family in northern Japan, told by an old wise tree. The excellent soundtrack completes the film well. Today it would be a good seller, better than many of the weak offers for children's movies today.
