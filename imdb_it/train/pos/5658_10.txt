This was one of the best shows ever made for TV. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists. Compulsive Vision I was lucky to see it in the UK. The order of the episodes could be wrong, I can't remember, but at least it was active at regular intervals every week. My girlfriend and I were hooked by the trailer, and none of us is a big fan of the American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We lost a couple of episodes and made you sad and angry for a week to lose those lol. <br /> <br /> Great casting, superb acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned into an extraordinary performance for a child, and Paige Turco was at her best even after Party of Five. And Nick Searcy, of course, as the suffering sheriff's friend. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which I assume would be explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. This made the ending weak, and it could be said that they killed him. Did they do WHAT? Why did they do it with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.
