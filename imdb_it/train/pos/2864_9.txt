It had to be a joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for all the women to get involved in some Cartwright man. After all, Ben Cartwright was a widower with a son three times for every marriage. And every woman who has been involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe will end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the widow's formula and the three children who gave birth to this classic western TV. <br /> <br /> Maybe if we did Bonanza today the writers would have female revolving characters that came and went from the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some are good, others are not, it's just life. And today we are less demanding than our heroes, so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But this is if Bonanza had ended today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot from our western heroes and from Bonanza, even if it took a while and a change of schedule from NBC helped us, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his brave children. Ben Cartwright was the ideal television dad for every genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa widespread for his three children. The children were all different in personality, but all of them came together in a pinch. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights have become and still are an American institution. I imagine that this family is more interested in people than the Kennedys. Only the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to this. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as eldest son Adam was written outside the show. It is said that he did not like the noble characters of Cartwright he felt bordered on sanctity. Perhaps if it had been done now, he would have liked it better the way I described it. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people got three successful TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, the hottest, but the most romantic of the Cartwright. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. the show continued with the two younger sons, but when the great Dan Blocker left, the heart came out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added at the time, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted the young Mitch Vogel. But great, faithful, but a little often Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden death after surgery left a hole too big in that family. <br /> <br /> So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have gone down in history. I got a taste of how America took Cartwright to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, right where you see the Ponderosa on the map in the opening credits, there's Cartwright's house, the set kept and opened as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they weren't real, they should have been.
