I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and thought it was really fun. It wasn't as bad as some critics were doing it. The fact that it was written by the usual reliable John Hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is good enough and that it was even written off guard by Hughes). <br /> <br /> The film has a very striking appearance using all the primary colors - red, yellow, etc. - which makes it quite unique. The cast is also quite good. The prudent Bunny Packard and the devil-possessed Delores Salk are a show. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly a bit dated, but personally I prefer it to all the other "Lampoon" series.
