I found this film very inspiring. The premise is quite imaginative, and as a spectator I was dragged as the characters developed. The rhythm is very well done for those who like to think - soon enough it is kept hidden from the viewer, and questions continue to arise which are then answered, producing a well thought out and very satisfying film, both brain and action point of view. <br /> <br /> It seems that some people were looking for a non-stop roller coaster ride with this film - one of those that is loaded out of the gate. This would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first slowly takes you up the hill - creating a wonderful sense of anticipation - and is ultimately, in my mind, more rewarding for the initially planned foundations. <br /> <br /> Excellent film.
