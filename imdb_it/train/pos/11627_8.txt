Lisa is a hotelier or owner and takes a flight to Miami. She finds herself sitting next to a murderer named Jackson who tells her that she needs to change rooms of a family or that her father dies. The reason he has to change rooms is because Jackson wants to blow him up. <br /> <br /> It is a film of great suspense because Lisa looks for different ways to escape this trick that Jackson has created. The whole plot is fantastic and I thought they could spend a little more time on the plane. He could have had more on the plane, but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the ending because it was a panacea. I didn't know what was going to happen and I was surprised. For me, this film has just taken off.
