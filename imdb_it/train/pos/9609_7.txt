This was a good film, I liked it. I thought it was a fairly accurate aspect of bulimia and how it was not a diet, it's about having such a profound pain that they have to find a way to deal with it and choose it. Beth was a very carefully drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mother about eating disorders, you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep is the pain she feels. I also think that one of the best jokes in the film is one in which Beth screams the words: "It's not about you". to his mother. Those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. I think that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
