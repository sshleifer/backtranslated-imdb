Adrien Wilde, the photographer of the magazine for men in distress (played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrible nightmares in which she brutally kills her models. When the adorable ladies start to really die, Adrien worries that he could be the murderer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman recounts the compelling storyline at a steady pace, builds a reasonable amount of tension, offers some moments of wildly violent misogynist violence (a woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake placed over her head considers the culminating moment that induces squeaks), gives a refreshing emphasis to sincere well-designed and engaging characters, further bases everything in a plausible everyday world, and completes things with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity. The beautiful acting of an excellent cast helps a lot: Joanna Pettet as love and solar love Mindy Jordache, James Stacy in the role of Adrien's macho brother, BJ, Seymour Cassel in the role of Adrien's psychiatrist, dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter in the role of Adrien. the gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as the brave detective of Sergeant Fountain Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a tough-nosed police chief, and Misty Rowe as the sweet and bubbly model Bambi. The refined cinematography of R. Michael Stringer makes the occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots impressive. Even the unpleasant score of Jack Goga does the trick. Popping in frivolous parts are Robert Tessier in the role of a grumpy prankster, Sally Kirkland as an impertinent prostitute, Kathy Shower as a fierce female fighter B.J. struggling with in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her standard roles as an elderly woman. A solid and fun photo.
