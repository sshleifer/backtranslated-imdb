Since I'm so interested in lake monsters, I really dug this film. This film deserves to be seen. If you like the so terrible that they are good types of movies, take a look. The effects are really good and he thinks "Land of the Lost". Originally I saw this movie in the early 90s perhaps more like 89/90 in a monster show on the local channel called "Morgus Presents". It doesn't scare me but I was 8 and anything B felt more like an A. Years later I saw it on DVD in a local Circuit City and bought it immediately so I could give it a 9 because it has a personal place in my heart right there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Have fun with the B movie for all ages.
