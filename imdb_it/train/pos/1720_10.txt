This Biograph short was so fun to watch. The second on the disc one of D.W. The "Years of Discovery" set by Griffith (highly recommended) presents three excellent performances by the main protagonists, and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a campy musician who gives a Countess to the eye ( and other things). <br /> <br /> The Countess' husband goes crazy for his wife's betrayal and has her walled in a small room with her lover. It's amazing that they don't hear the wall getting up, but hey, maybe the wine has something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of the silent Raymond Hackett) gestures wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes to an end. While the lady faints in shock and fear, once she realizes she is doomed, Henry takes his instrument and "fans" it at her. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange, sexy way, and I just lost it and I laughed. The expression on his face! From that moment I was fascinated by Henry B. Walthall.
