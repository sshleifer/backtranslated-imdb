I saw "An American in Paris" at its first release when I was still at school and I immediately fell in love with it. I went back to see him the next day and lost count of the number of times I've seen him since, both in the cinema and on TV. He makes fantastic use of some of the best songs and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and presents the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in the history of Hollywood. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (eccentric as always), Georges Guetary (why didn't he make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an unpleasant role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed with the music of the title, makes excellent use of the images and sounds of Paris and the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (the guys from Paris who join Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine "). If you love Paris, watch this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, watch it. But watch it!
