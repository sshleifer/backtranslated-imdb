After reading a lot of good reviews on this film I decided to take it for a ride (I bought it on DVD, hence the word play "spin" ... I'm a jerk). The beginning was all I hoped for, a perfect set-up (along with some quotes I heard on various Wu-Tang albums) to what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so great, it was so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except for the lizard) I imagined what Venom was. Furthermore, the only interesting character is killed in the middle of the film. Ok, so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right? Mistaken. The fights were very short and few and far between. Granted the different styles were all pretty good, but I wish the fights were longer. I kept hoping to see the lizard run and make a mad ish on the walls but it never happened. I was hoping to see Centipede do some quick laps but it never happened. I was hoping to see the scorpion in the film for more than 7 minutes total, but it never happened. In short, not much happens. Combat is all pretty routine. Don't be fooled just because this movie has a plot, it doesn't mean it's a good movie.
