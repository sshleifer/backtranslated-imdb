This film is about a dysfunctional family but not a dysfunctional family. It concerns the Family of the Father of our nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. Shows how the Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to achieve our freedom. Whenever Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to get close, the Mahatma would have come between them. This is a well made film. Akshaye Khanna has proven to be a Top Actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who is primarily the actor of Plays-Gurukant Desai in Guru, played Gandhi wonderfully (as a true Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God) Shefali Shah, the girl from Monsoon Wedding, did a great job of showing how Kasturba Gandhi was divided between father and son. This film is moving, as is its "Raghupati Raghava" soundtrack sung in a very unique way. I saw this movie only 3 hours ago (released in Dubai a day before - on the 2nd) and when the film was finished there was "Pin Drop Silence" and as he was leaving the Theater, NOT one person pushed another (You can imagine we Indians do not push?) NOT ONE! There was a sacred silence ...
