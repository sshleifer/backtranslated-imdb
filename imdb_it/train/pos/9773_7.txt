The plot is really horrible, the atmosphere really depressing, unusual for a low-budget production like that, and at least, for a German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mystical thriller and slasher movies mixed together. The development of the plot and the characters are fantastic, the sets are very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. It may be perfect, but unfortunately some things have been a bit disappointing, which is not necessarily the case for low-budget films: <br /> <br /> 1.) The cast is sometimes not above average . Almost all the actors resemble a layman. Some of them do a good job, or a great job, but some behave like the actors of lousy German court shows! But I was very disappointed with Mathieu Carri√®re's acting! His acting (in many of his older films his acting was fine) was below average here! But this could be the reason, because today he takes part in crap of soap operas or TV series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) The dialogues are sometimes at the level of soap operas. <br /> <br /> 3.) Bad sound sometimes made it very difficult to understand, what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was happy to be able to rewind it and listen to it again. It is caused by the set (large rooms like in the hospital or with the group esoterically) and sometimes by the strange dialects of the actors! <br /> <br /> But all in all, it's an interesting film, well worth seeing, far beyond commercial films, which are often more terrible.
