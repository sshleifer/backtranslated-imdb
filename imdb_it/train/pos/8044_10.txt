First, this is simply the funniest movie I've ever seen. It incorporates slapstick perfectly in time, sexual humor and cleverly designed standing position. But it goes deeper than that. The Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we don't see often) that made me hope that there is love out there, that two people who love each other can work through their adversities; and that such a comedy about life (something that I think we all should have) can be accepted by the people that really matter. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope we will see more films of all those involved in the future.
