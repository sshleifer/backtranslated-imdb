Finally we have before us a category III film for the summer season 2006. Made of equal parts cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog is not limited to just a suitable title, but also to a flexible direction, to a superb cinematography and to performances of all respect. Of course there must be a grip, manifested here in the form of obvious contradictions, yet all this has said that DBD represents the mature spirit that we would like to see more in the HK mainstream. <br /> <br /> marks the announced return of Edison Chen, long absent from the initial debacle a year ago. Chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the film, yet it would have been hard without Sam Lee, whose talent for alternating physical comedy (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) and mad threat culminated in the strongest role that we have seen from him in Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duo does Dog Bite Dog, and we hope that Edison will have an easier break from now on: his touch has turned the Princess D projects into the Infernal Affairs saga, and still remains a rare event. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, DBD showcases some mesmerizing images, playing beautiful tricks with lights, shadows and perspective. The soundtrack increases this atmospheric effect, adding the unreal mood that the film shows. Much of the resulting combination probably has to do with writer Matt Chow, previously engaged in three equally gruesome extremes. Dog Bite Dog preserves many traits remembered by that horror project, that is urban degraded and a pervasive air of something disturbing around the corner. <br /> <br /> Rest assured, however, this is not a horror movie, but follows a path trodden by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, albeit from a more perverse angle. Replacing the reluctant killer character of Daniel Wu, we have Edison, who plays a nameless killing machine from the underworld of Cambodia. Sent Hong Kong to perform a single goal, the almost silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival, a chilling process depicted by courtesy of the film's brilliant graphics. <br /> <br /> Although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer, Edison's wild dog of the same name still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail, picked up by a CID team sent to investigate. This assembly presents a nice cameo of the feat of the mass movie Lam Suet and good support from TV star Wayne Lai. However, the renegade officer of Sam Lee, Wai, leads the charge, revealing that he is a very disturbed individual but still a very good policeman. We gradually learn the roots of Wai's inner conflict from his father's police corruption background, evoking demons at his fingertips in the relentless pursuit that ensues. <br /> <br /> A counting of minor bodies transpires, given that Edison seems to consider taking prisoners. There is enough the quotient of violence in store, even if the gore itself feels attenuated in the places, and the language for adults only makes a symbolic aspect. Once again, no nudity, which leads to the conclusion of Cat III, is delivered a little hastily these days. Still, DBD is a relatively mature theatrical release, and we congratulate you on your arrival. <br /> <br /> Between fights, stabs, hacking and shootings, even a career murderer needs some romance, and just as Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, even the intrepid Mr. Chen he gets a sweet love, done beautifully by the newcomer Pei Pei. His unnamed character (a lot of anonymity in this) meets Edison in a strange abandoned landfill, abused by his father to the point of a repulsive madness and lust for escape. When the killer gets rid of HK, he agrees to take her with him, and together they escape, loving to bloom along the way. While the film does not dwell on things full of love, our hearts go to the tragic character of Pei Pei and his infinite suffering. It makes the shy but valiant protagonist incredibly good, establishing that there are neither good nor bad here, highlighted by the very worrying ending. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes the recent suspense thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers probably outdated in most stories by the sinister demeanor of Dog Bite Dog. Cheang manages to keep the DBD in circulation, and considering the many parts at stake here, he resists the critical standards set by people like Johnny To in his epic nightly epic movie The Mission. A couple of problems occur, with Edison miraculously shooting at his chest, but these are highly forgivable. <br /> <br /> Marking the triumphant returns for two young, talented artists of the genre that Hong Kong needs we want the city's golden film to return, Dog Bite Dog does not stand out in history. Its strength is represented by a strong portrait and style, supported by the strength of the thespian muscle and by a sharp eye for visual and auditory finesse. <br /> <br /> HK has a long and honored tradition of stories to do with the city's nocturnal alter-ego, something that Dog Bite Dog affirms lovingly, equal to a solid race if not an absolute masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
