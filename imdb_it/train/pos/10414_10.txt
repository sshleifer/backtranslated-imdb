I discovered for the first time Fantasy by Alexander Korda (1940), THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950s on a re-issue announced as "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on a never-forgotten program. Miklos Rozsa's music has improved both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF DI BAGDAD remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. Over the years, it has become more difficult to enjoy the color of the film in the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor gave way to an Eastman Color trial in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn have reprinted the film both in the hall and on video. But Eastman Color's prints were more pastel in nature and softened the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. Even the Laser Disc version of this title has a pastel look - nice, but not as it should be. NOW the DVD of M-G-M (3 December 2002) arrives. THE THIEF DI BAGDAD has again the wonderful Technicolor look on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see him so once again that after watching the DVD once, I looked at it a second time. The only "Extra" are a dubious Spanish version, subtitles in English and Spanish and a well-made original theatrical trailer. Thanks M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD output. Now, one can only hope that the FOUR PIECES of Korda and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to be replaced in circulation with public domain prints) will soon follow on DVD.
