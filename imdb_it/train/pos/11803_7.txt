"Sasquatch Hunters" really wasn't as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the woods, Park Rangers Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacey Branscombe) accompany Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White) her head Dr. Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area. When they camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and other strange bones scattered around the area. When group members begin to disappear, they begin to wander through the woods to safety. It turns out that a Sasquatch is behind the killings and that the team unites to survive. <br /> <br /> The good news: it wasn't as bad as I thought. The film really starts to take a little steam around the mid-point, when the creature attacks. This is a masterful series of scenes, since the whole group is subject to creature attacks, and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high. The wooded area is more suitably milked during these parts, increasing tension and wondering when a single person wandering in the forest will get his well-deserved punishment. It also spreads quite freely through the film is the effective use of ringh and off-screen roars that are truly not worldly. They really add a lot to make this part so disturbing, as well as the other times you hear the growling cry. It is quite effective and works well. It's pretty nice that the next part of the film picks up the pace, since it goes very well with an action note. A scene that, in particular, I think should be indicated as a special scene for the first vision. While a man crosses the forest by the creature, he identifies the expedition that has continued to search for it. Raising his hands to ask them for help, the second who announces his presence is attacked from nothing and killed quickly. It took me by surprise and actually made me a little jump at first sight. <br /> <br /> The bad news: there were only a couple of things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. The creature here is mostly made from a horrible CGI, which made it totally ridiculous and destroyed any credibility it could have had. The threatening air caused by the opening of the film is almost exploded from the window when the creature appears on the screen. He is so distracted that it is a pity that a little more work has not been put into it. I complained a lot about this, and it's something that should really be eliminated, as it doesn't seem realistic and it's pretty fake. Another big one is the out-of-field kills here. Very often in the film a person grabbed and then ripped off, and then found the body bloody afterwards. It's rather aggravating when the killings look beautiful and juicy later. Otherwise, I really don't have a lot of problems with this, since everything that is usually criticized for this didn't really bother me, but it is required of others besides this stuff. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: I liked this, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie ever. It shouldn't be taken seriously and, if viewed this way, it's really fun. Fans of these films should take a look at this, and those who love Sci-Fi features can also find nice things here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and some graphic carcasses
