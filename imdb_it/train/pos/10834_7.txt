I didn't approach "Still Crazy" with no real expectation. Just another image of rock'n'roll, I thought ... good longing for baby boomers. This film is partially this, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, previously directed a biography of Tina Turner, and is quite successful in his style. I imagine it is right that this was his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as band's frontman. Actor-director-director Bruce Robinson appears as the band's busted guitarist. He does a great job, even though he hasn't appeared in films since the late 1970s. If you're looking for a moving and fun movie (with some great songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
