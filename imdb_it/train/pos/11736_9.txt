Those who are not familiar with Elvira, the alter ego of Cassandra Peterson, then this is a good starting point. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroine with gravity-defying tits receiving a Message. It seems that an aunt of hers is dead and that she needs to be present to read the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in the hope of getting a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place to go is the city of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to be enchanted by the collapse of her car, she discovers that her great aunt has left her 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. Residents of the city have mixed reactions: boys like her, women hate her and men crave her (even if she tries to remain moral columns of the community). His worst problem turns out to be his great-uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants his cookbook. It seems that the recipe book is a spell book that will make it a more powerful sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The film is actually quite funny, with Peterson aka Elvira using his "talents" and sensuality as a joke ("And don't forget, tomorrow we'll show the head with two things ... I mean the thing with two heads "). Particularly amusing as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works hard to keep the city in line, but ends up looking ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). Worth a peek (the film, not her tits, of course).
