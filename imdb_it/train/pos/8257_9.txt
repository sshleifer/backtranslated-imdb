I just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and loved it. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been a pioneer (certainly "extrapolated" widely and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, YES, actually I think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. The fun performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray are absolutely credible and perhaps even more important, which I suspect we will see much more in the future. However, I must confess that I really liked Tim Blake Nelson's delightful turn as the neighbor Mr. Theopolis, essentially interpreting a deliberate animated version of Victor Van Dort of the Corpse Bride (or, for those who saw the film, he would not do they read even better here as the Corpse Pride?) and, of course, the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his less animated, but somewhat deeply moving role as a titular character. Think, he wouldn't have gotten this role if it wasn't for Peter Stormare's commitments to Prison Break (as was revealed in the questions and answers after the Thursday night screening). I can't help hypothesizing that the writers should get a lot of inspiration from the Bubbles Zombie of Day Of The Dead. I am not excited to reveal details of the plot during a comment and I will not start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dark and graphically clumsy Zombie movies you can count on Romero. Rather it is a film that will make you laugh constantly and, even if (and I had to return carefully to be sure) there is a good dose of blood and violence, the delicious humor, so well valued by the surreal environment created by the Currie and by his co-writers, he does a lot to make this look like a feature that should be evaluated by PG-13. I urge you to go see this little gem of Canuck. I will certainly buy the DVD once it emerges with hope by next summer.
