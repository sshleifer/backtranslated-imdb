Japanese cyber-punk movies have never done much for me, but most of the handful I saw was at least visually interesting and at least mostly fun. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a kind of parasites that takes possession of human guests, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "necroborgs" and causes them to fight each other with purpose exclusive of eating each other - apparently like a "game" for the enjoyment of these parasites. The film revolves mainly around a shy boy and a girl who fall in love with each other, but whose love affair is interrupted by both being infected by parasites, and forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of the human will against the control of the parasite on their physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO (like most cyber-punk films), and for good reason . There are certainly thematic parallels, even if the films are definitely different. There are lots of fun and picky moments in MEATBALL MACHINE, and the creatures / borg FX are definitely the highest point - a mixture of TETSUO-meets-GWAR that are both elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you like hyper-kinetic cyber-punk movies with a good dose of splatter, this is for you ... 7/10
