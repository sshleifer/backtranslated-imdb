I wasn't sure if this would be just another one of those idiotic nightly soap workers who seem to fool in the early evening but, apparently, this is a pretty good show (not small thanks to the talented cast). Four friends with different backgrounds get together and share the weekly stories of their love lives. The one-hour program follows each of them separately through their often ruined searches to find love and does so without being boring or trivial. "Trudi" by Sharon Small is the housewife (allegedly widowed after 9/11) who gets a bit of a sermon and hassle with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their efforts). It's nice to see Small back on t.v., since she was very good at "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The chick can act. The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most damaged but still very likeable of women, as she fights with her gentle but absorbed husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly of "Spooks") in his urgent desire to have a baby with her, regardless of her needs. The last two cast members are the effervescent Jess (Shellie Conn), an event organizer who is a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, the non-specific genre, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish), a somber doctor who has a relationship with a patient his son sent his career and he loves life spiraling out of control. That being said, I am passionate now and I hope the BBC continues to pull off this series because it's good, it's different and has an exceptional cast.
