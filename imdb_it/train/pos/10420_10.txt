The Grande Caruso shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He has a great acting ability and is in excellent shape as an opera singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare say that he plays some songs better than Caruso (he controls A'Vuchella di Tosti and La Danza by Rossini). The MGM music and art departments have also done a good job. This film could be perfect, were it not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth; we see that he is doing his best, dressed in 1950s style scenes shortly before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better protagonist, and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions. Note also that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets with Lanza, giving the wrong idea that Caruso had some sort of permanent leader soprano.
