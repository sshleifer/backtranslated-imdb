No, I'm not kidding. If ever, NEVER, you have the chance to watch this movie see it. If you need to cut your arm to see it, look at it. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives The bus is unlike any movie you've ever seen. He takes the trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art. Although it contains few shots, idiotic characters, ugly dialogues, strange acting and cinematography that belongs to public access in Iowa, it actually manages to achieve its goal as a film. He strives to be the dumbest, weirdest, silliest movie you've ever seen. And the boy is always successful. <br /> <br /> I will prepare the plot for those of you who care about such things (the producers obviously didn't), but in reality you don't need to pay too much attention because the whole plot of the film is presented in a very long text reproduced before the opening titles. In any case, FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago, which is led by Satan. See, Jesus is in the city, and all the passengers on the bus should die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except with Jesus in the city, a lackey in hell calls work out, and this angers Satan because, well, he doesn't like to look crazy in front of the guy, so he decides to convince people on the bus to sign their souls directly, but he's a devil, so he needs to disguise himself, otherwise, he'd go on tour with him right, so dress up as Roger and get on the bus, where the driver is never called by name, but he's a bit fat, so I guess it's Grasso. The bus (and the knights) are on a collision course with bad temper! <br /> <br /> Examples of some madness: the title is repeated on the screen 3 times. I do not know why. A character appears on the bus in mid-travel without explanations or presentations, and occasionally sits next to others, and they look at her as if she didn't belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange nostalgic looks, which are actually the same shots repeated over and over again. I do not know why. After Satan has given a long monologue about transformation into human form, a business card flashes "Satan will transform". I do not know why. A character is a woman who is very clearly a man in drag, and is defined by other characters as "the charming Bridget". I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If there was one good thing that came out of my internship in Troma last summer, I received my copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
