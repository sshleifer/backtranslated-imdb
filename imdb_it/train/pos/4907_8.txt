A well-made and imaginative production, pleasantly refreshing from the clich√©s, this somewhat picaresque story tells a story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy in non-ideal conditions: the man a convicted person on the run who has kidnapped the youth for its value as a hostage Directed by Alan Gibson with a fine sense for a balanced narrative movement, the film offers freshness in almost all scenes, such as felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his refusal for the word was particularly undeserved, he builds a complicated but ultimately successful escape plan, following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to his childhood residence on the lake. Often bursting into a song or dancing a few steps, the capricious Steckert gradually gains the confidence and affection of his prisoner and, as the police approaches for an inevitable showdown, the bound couple is seen in a very similar way in the answers to forms of refusal, as discerned by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) charged with helping a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) who is responsible for the manhunt for Steckert and his "prisoner". This is a compelling story, which is worth telling, a novel and new adventure that benefits from a capital performance of Harris, beautiful curves from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as the kidnapped boy, with a appropriately extravagant score a contribution by Wilfred Josephs and a first-rate cinematography by Frank Watts, with all the footage shot in a beautiful autumn province of Ontario.
