First of all, I'd like to say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought that Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you can't at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and embrace your inner seven, your old man may want to avoid this movie. Having said that, having just seen the restored 137-minute DVD version, I must say that I liked it, though not as much as when I was seven (I remembered the ending). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the film worthy of criticism, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes both have really comical moments, my favorite is the contrast between the scenes played in the last 10 minutes and the curious choice of accompanying music (listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> For an action film we focus a lot on the personal stories of some soldiers and on the social dynamics of the team, given that the tension of their time travel has a price. By the end of the film, I had decided that this was a good thing, when I was seven, although the relationship was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For an action movie there is also plenty of rewarding action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and the hordes of warriors of the Shogun era. The film's creators have assured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, let's face it, humorous. I thought this was a wonderful aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say that I still do it. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers in general don 'Spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space-time continuum, they have large-caliber machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers , a tank and a helicopter and are ready to make their feudal Japan. Which is what I'd like to think that any IMDb user would have done in their boots. <br /> <br /> In short, the films that are worth watching, make the viewer regret that there are no more films made with a similar premise and at the same time offers some important suggestions as to why a film like GI Samurai is so single.
