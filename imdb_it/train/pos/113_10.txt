I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite films, this is what I seem to mention first. There are some films (works of art like this film, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden yet so sensitive that it gives a permanent impression on the viewer , not unlike a life-changing event, like the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film "shook me" when I saw it for the first time. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
