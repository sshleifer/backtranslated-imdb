This was an excellent film. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. There was so much to connect, so many beautiful images and so much compassion in things that had not been said. I was completely entertained, and I still had a feeling of joyful exuberance, just as I am when I finish most of Tom Robbins' story. Now I haven't read this particular Robbin's book, so I don't know how this got along, but I can't imagine that this movie could have been a bad interpretation. The film has left a lot for you to define yourself, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, to dream up the details. <br /> <br /> To all of you who have said that this was the worst film of all time, I pity the little that must be left of the lightening in your hearts. Far from the worst ever this film was glorious. Long life for the crane.
