"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is as much fun as the Batman animated movies. <br /> <br /> While remaining faithful to the sentiment of comics, animation is done with a lighter spirit than in serious animation. Bruce Wayne looks very similar to before, but now he seems a little less impressive. Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less shy and youthful Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, invokes the voice of Batman better than most live actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a much more decent vocal acting job than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in the live action films of Batman, the film lives or dies based on the quality of the villains. My all-time favorite, the penguin, is here. Its design is more elegant than it has ever appeared before, giving more attention to the portrait of Burged Meredith of the 1960s than to the portrait of Danny DeVito of "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice. The penguin is finally interpreted as a clever sophisticated, just as it appears more commonly in comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a Bane that is much more memorable than the forgettable version in "Batman & Robin". And finally, Batman has a mystery to solve, putting the "Detective" back in "Detective Comics" (this is what "DC" means, after all). The mystery revolution is a delightfully devious twist. > <br /> The score adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the film. It looks like a mix between the "Poirot" soundtrack and the "Mission: Impossible" score. All in all, it's more fun than your average cartoon.
