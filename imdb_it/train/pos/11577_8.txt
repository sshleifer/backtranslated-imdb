This was a really interesting movie. It simply shows that you don't need silly things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. Cross the continents in seconds, people get hit and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, the samuari fights the sinking galleons, David Essex is the epitome of the evil muddy and John Rhys Davies is just the type. I liked this movie, but I like s ** t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s ** t movie that only KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth you'll love this movie, its spasm, its fast, its fool, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It also looks like it was made in 1972
