I can honestly say that I never expected this film to be good. I don't like family movies. I'm far from a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director's last film (MPKDH was a complete stupidity and the music was very boring and insipid, but there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There were also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher that I am very much I finally saw the film and was very impressed, it brings us the young MPK lovers with a little HAHK wedding, and we have a winner, the plot is similar to that of HAHK, in the end light to serious mode at the end. The director also created a character you could relate to, the thing I didn't like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric, its perfection, Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance, that's a remarkable improvement and, above all, adapts to the role: the best is easily Amrita Rao, in fact it is her best performance, her presence on the screen is so thrilling they are destined to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakas h, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are extraordinarily expressed. Not an actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing, but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Even Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is beautiful to see. The songs are not colorful and dancing, and are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein who is meant to remember HSSH and HAHK. So what was the flaw in the film? The film becomes rather slow and the ending is rather tense. But the film still goes at a good pace, making it a perfect family movie.
