The Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best films ever made! I think the only reason it was great was for the Ramones! You couldn't have created the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols or The Clash in place of The Ramones, it wouldn't have been the same. Dey Young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the hall monters, have just added to the film. The whole movie is about the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed up to see Rock 'n' Roll High School if you're a big fan of the real PUNK. Not the disgusting new girl ... but the strong and quick type. The type that only the Ramones could do. R.I.P. (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
