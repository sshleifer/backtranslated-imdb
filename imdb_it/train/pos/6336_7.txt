OK, so FX's are not high-budget. But this story is based on real events. Not something created together to make a couple of rich, even richer actors !! Like most book-based movies, there is something that simply doesn't fit. Only a couple of people claimed that this film was based on real events, not a knock-off as many believe it to be !! This film is in no way connected to TWISTER! In addition to both films, they talk about tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with tornado science and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember ... The current "night of the twisters" was 3 June 1980. So this film was released 16 years after the real events. Try to think about how far the storm research has progressed at that time. It happened in a bigger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the city something else, and says it's a small city.
