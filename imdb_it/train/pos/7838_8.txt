If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I suggest you check this. It shows an extravagant side of Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr, apparently having fun shooting some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving the sense of knowing them as only people, and when the concert is shown a musician talented, both playful and professional, that oscillates and seems to impress screaming girls. Looking at it in concert, you would never know being a rock star is a job, but having fun making good songs with some good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances. True, there are some missing songs that I'd like to have seen there, but like any album it can't have everything. I just bought it in 2006, but if I knew it was released in 1972, I would have definitely bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love of cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car accident!
