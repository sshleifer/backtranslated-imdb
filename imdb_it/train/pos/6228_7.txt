Another fun, witty, bubbly RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a fascinating film. Although it lacks the great songs of SWNG TIME (even if the final number "Facing the music and the dance" is one of the best and rightly of the team), it is extremely funny, since these two could practically not go wrong together in the 30s . Once again, the plot is light and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is a real paradise. These two have transmitted more romance and magic in the dance than many pairs of films in a great love scene. While there are the best Fred and Ginger musicals, this is definitely a must-see.
