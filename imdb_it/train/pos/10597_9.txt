I congratulate the photos that prove something different. Many films seem just retreats of old ideas, so this is the big reason why I highly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film is set just after the Second World War and the shortages and post-war rationing seem to drive the "barmy" Londoners. The film focuses on a small London neighborhood called Pimlico. They too are fed up with not being able to buy what they want but can't see the way. This until they accidentally run into a hidden treasure and a card that officially defined this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! With this document, they reason, they can ignore all rations and coupons and live life as they wish, since it turns out that they are NOT really British SUBJECTS! Where the film goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you will have to see for yourself. Let the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios come out with this gem!
