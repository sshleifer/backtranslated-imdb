<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mixture of sensuality and dullness. The film runs slow, very slow, but takes a rhythm to tell a story of murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is almost sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, the psychological heat, the footsteps of the past ... the flashback scenes, the strangeness of the character of Patric, everything becomes a sexy mystery. I recommend this cause it's the most sexy boring movie I've ever seen. Check out the love scene, it's particularly sexy.
