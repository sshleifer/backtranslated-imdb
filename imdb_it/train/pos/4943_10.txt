This is the creation of a film to the simplest and is the best. <br /> <br /> I had my doubts, because even though Freeman is a great actor, he is sometimes involved in wrong projects; this is not one of those times. <br /> <br /> It's a small story that lasts just over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we're getting used to having longer and not necessarily better films, the director uses the little time to his advantage, because the characters are so well defined from the beginning (great portraits of Freeman and Vega by the way), that the basic information about them seems real, Morgan is himself even though his name is not mentioned , has been out of the cinema for a couple of years because he was saturated with business, and developed the fear of devoting himself to a script, and is doing research for a character in an independent film where he plays a managerial role in the store / supermarket. The story begins with his fall in a supermarket in a difficult neighborhood, where he meets the cashier of the 10 objects or not (Vega) and has to take a ride with her because "the production" has forgotten to take it. <br /> <br /> In many ways it's a road movie, Morgan offers laughter and quirks with his unbeatable smile and his positive outlook on everything, showcasing an experienced actor who has trained his mind to be able to define everyone he sees in a character he could play, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinary beauty, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a separated 25-year-old woman who works harder than anyone else without get no credit in a dead end job in a lousy supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a talkie, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well supported, the characters become so adorable right away to spend the last 20 minutes begging more time on thi's screen It is a strange pair, but brevity is in the nature of the story, so it was a good invitation from the director not to give in.
