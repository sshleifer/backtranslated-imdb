This is a fantastic ending to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to double pass on the Borg was great. The fact that he allowed himself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a "poison" that, in essence, ended up that the Borg were great. The way they ended up also left a little, not a lot, for a meeting movie. However, they took them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. Stop it with Tom and B'Lanna having their own baby as they enter the Alpha dial. it was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some kind - just to see where their characters would be today.
