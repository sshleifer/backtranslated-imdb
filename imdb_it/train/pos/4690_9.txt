Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in some classes for children in Entomology and I can still remember the excitement of children; they were enchanted! It is not just the termites that built and live in the "Castles of Clay", but also other animals that use the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a mongoose colony watches. It is not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology because there is so much about the interactions between termites and other organisms and about the entire ecology of all the organisms that live in and around the mounds . <br /> <br /> I would like it to be available on DVD, so that I could watch it again and show others.
