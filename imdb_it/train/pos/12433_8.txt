This is a good movie, although people who don't know the comic books and Modesty Blaise's books might find it a bit slow and lacking in action. For the Modesty fan, the film will be a lot of fun, especially because it is very faithful to the presentation of Modesty Blaise's "story". Peter O'Donnell is listed in the credits as "Creative Consultant" and filmmakers must have paid attention to him as the plot follows closely enough the details that were presented in comics over the years (although the events were recast to the modern days). The only thing the real fan can find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in history. This lack of Willie is again faithful to Modesty Blaise's chronology since the film takes place in the very early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden is a very credible young modesty that looks a lot like Modesty should look. A welcome change from the disguise of the portrait of Monica Vitti by Modesty.
