this film is simply fantastic. if you have the chance to see it, then you should rush to see it. Although the film has almost nothing to do with its original 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has so on him where he can say something anyway and make it look fantastic. if you thought Pulp Fiction was good with bad words (if you saw it), you should also see Scarface to see another angle on how an actor can say it. (it's pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> even though the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast over time, not maintaining the correct real-time proportions, it's still easy to follow, but you have to keep eyes open at all times not to lose anything. personally, I discovered that watching this movie makes child's play look like three hours, it's really cool. <br /> <br /> this film is one of the films that is played and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s, but that really makes you become a fan of the bad guy . "So say good night to the bad boy"
