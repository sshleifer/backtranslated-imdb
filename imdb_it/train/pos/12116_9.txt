... that Bette Davis's version of this film was better than Kim Novak's version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even though Novak's version has a more coherent plot. <br /> <br /> However: Mildred's raw emotions from Davis seem to me more suited to a slender girl who seems to easily become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> are those raw emotions that constitute * part * of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, failure, "otherness" - strong emotions that he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, shows his emotions immediately and uncensored. He has no feelings of despair, failure or "otherness"; rather, she is simply surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than Davis was, almost through the entire movie. Davis's Mildred was ** never ** vulnerable until she had to go to the doctor and ask for assistance. And when he insults her - for his method of keeping body and soul together, and to continually take advantage of his love for her - undoubtedly unleashes the most passionate repudiation of the most snobbish of you ever seen on screen: I dried my mouth! I wiped my mouth !! "Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> The authors' votes are in agreement!
