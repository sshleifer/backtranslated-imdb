The first and only time I saw the woman in black was the only time, to my knowledge, she appeared on TV in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my father and I were watching in the living room just before we all went midnight service in the village church. At the time I was quite young, but I'm not sure that he was more terrified walking through the church yard to the church entrance that night, me or my father !. <br /> <br /> There are many factors about movies that make it so disturbing, but I think one of these is the fact that there isn't much in the way of a soundtrack that sounds against the background of almost any Hollywood movies, so every creak, thump and bang is more amplified in your head than there is no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories does not involve any jumping factor like the things that bounce in the closet, so it doesn't necessarily make what you see but what you feel and what you think is happening. This is a smart medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running in revolt thinking about what's around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A superb ghost story, I have never seen anything that can match it and with all the slag repeating ad infinitum on TV, I can't believe that the BBC canceled it later (to my knowledge) just a projection!
