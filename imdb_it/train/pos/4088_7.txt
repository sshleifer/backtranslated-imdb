this is out there. Not much to say about it, except that it is a topic rarely touched in bestiality films. I can understand why this film has been banned for so long, the topics covered in the film are still a small taboo because most of the world will say that the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits the mood of the film. It's a good movie that is well acted and serves a purpose ... to shock the viewer and the transverse boundaries that we don't often see in movies. I came across this movie on the net that I thought I could control. I liked the film because it is stimulating and at the same time a little erotic. Something you rarely see in today's movies.
