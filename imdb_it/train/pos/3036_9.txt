The name says it all. I saw this film with my father when he came out and having served in Korea he had a great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this film is that it focuses only on a short period of human life - curiously the whole life of a man would have made such an epic bio-photo that it is disconcerting to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters escape the faulty characteristics of man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Duty, Honor, Country" are not just words blathered from the lips of a high brass officer: it is the profound declaration of a man's total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically Peck be the liberal who has been collected a better understanding of man. He does an excellent job showing the general without fear tempered by the human side of man.
