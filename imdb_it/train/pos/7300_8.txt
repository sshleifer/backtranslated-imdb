Like the gentle giants that make up the second half of the title of this film, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. The last issue of the producer, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but somehow they managed it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was his passable animatronix, which is always fun when it comes to wonderful worlds beneath the surface of the ocean. But even that was only passable. Little attention in some scenes made the production seem amateurish. With dolphins and whales, technology is almost completely wasted. Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's extraordinary 3D capabilities. There are too few scenes of depth or variety. The close-ups of these fantastic creatures seem simply flat and often there is only one creature in the field of cameras, so there is no contrast in depth. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow his father's footsteps, but when you have Shark-Week on cable TV, his introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
