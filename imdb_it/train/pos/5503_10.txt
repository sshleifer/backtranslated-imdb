The material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears. Yes, I tell you the tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire us all to defend our rights, assert the greater good of the community and stop inventing coward excuses not to challenge the establishment. Chavez represents the weak and the unfortunate in the same way that Bush is the face of dirty society and capitalism ran mad. In fact, Latin America is being remodeled and the marginalized majority finally has a voice in over five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to govern indefinitely. This cannot be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the film; The rhythm is breathtaking in moments and deeply philosophical in others. He describes Chavez as a folk hero who is not afraid to challenge the hegemony of the United States and the domination of world resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. A crucial message of the film is to question sources of information, as was clearly demonstrated by the victims of the snipper who are shamefully accused by Chavez supporters. Venezuela shames the alleged American democracy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
