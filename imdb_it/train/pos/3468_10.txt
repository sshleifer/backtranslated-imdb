I loved this movie! At first I was hesitant to look at him because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how difficult it was when John was killed. However, looking at the "Two of us" brought me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did an incredible job depicting what "could have been". Aidan Quinn was as adorable as Paul and faced the challenge. I was struck by his accent and his ways. Jared Harris is also very talented and was as credible as John. My favorite parts were the park scene and the rooftop scene - which was so touching. The film left me with sadness and satisfaction, both of which I consider appropriate, given the circumstances.
