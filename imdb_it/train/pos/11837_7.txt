This is a wonderful film in many ways. Everyone in my family liked us. The animation is excellent and it easily shows that there are many producers who create visually brilliant films like anything from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> A difference from the normal Disney rate is that this Dreamworks movie does not feature a wise side kick for relief from comedy. And there are no sudden moments when the characters break into the song. I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney movie: the birth of the Spirit. But it is tastefully done and not at all offensive. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of a great animated fare. As soon as they were finished, my children wanted to watch it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
