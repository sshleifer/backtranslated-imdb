I was hoping it would be nice as a fan of the timothy dalton james and even if it wasn't his well-deserved "third bond release" it was a laugh. Belushi brought some good cheer on his part and Dalton did a good job of it, but it was probably underutilized. he liked a camped version of jack nicholson in some good men. the other brit in it was a bit shocking, but overal was a laugh.
