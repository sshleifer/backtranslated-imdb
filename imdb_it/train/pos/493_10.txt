I've been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. When they announced the schedule and the premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise premiere was worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect ship to show the beginning of what many people have learned to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula was simply superior as Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave an impressive performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That only two people of this wonderful new crew will take us with courage in the great history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> Enterprise looks like it will be a good series that is worth looking at, and I recommend it. Watch it.
