I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I didn't know who the actors were, and I didn't know that the film would be different from the way it was intended. However, I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty plays 1930 detective Dick Tracy chasing the city's biggest criminals. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very powerful man and is ready to take over the city with his singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) who has his sights set on Tracy. It gets even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. Moreover, the famous villagers have returned from the comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to watch especially as a child. Warren Beaty was just like James Bond of the 1930s in the way he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> A cast of the cast includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O "Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus More! <br / > <br /> Dick Tracy is a film for all ages and is a fun film for the family.
