Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shaken by a haunting childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. Leave work as a dishwasher and become a swindler for wealthy people. Meet a misfit named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two grow noticeably close together and soon cannot live without one another. However, there is something very important that Ratso did not tell Joe, and could destroy any hope they have of surviving in the city together. This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a harrowing and shocking portrait of too lonely men who have nothing to lose but one another. Their story is devastating to watch, but it is ultimately important for the people to see. It's one of those movies where the characters are more or less like the apparently crazy people you sometimes find on the street. The difference is that this film is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see pedestrians in this film treat them as if they were filth, especially if we were once one of those people. However, the film does not attempt to feel guilty. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the peddling lifestyle. It's not a pleasant and relaxed lifestyle as many Hollywood movies portray him as MILK MONEY and ENOUGH WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a bully male is a dirty, gritty and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves like Joe's character in this movie. What struck me most about this film is that it was released in 1969 and has stood the test of time perfectly. Today's audience will still find great significance in this film and will love it again and appreciate it as much as critics and audiences have done anywhere in 1969. The film has been rated X, but what is known about this film is that sexuality it is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has had sex before will know how humorous, embarrassing and scary it can be and this movie doesn't avoid any of this. Sex in this movie may not be as graphic as it once was thought to be. The films that have been classified as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, SALUTI, ULTIMO TANGO In Paris and FRITZ THE CAT all seem much more domesticated than the shocking things that people today can get with an R rating. Sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will look pretty strong but I'm definitely not sexy. They are not graphics, but they are realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when they watch this movie. The language of the course used in the film, in particular the word "fag", is used effectively and is not free. Violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again it is necessary for the plot to represent the world of a hustler. I'm really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY isn't dated and it's still as fascinating as it was in 1969, if not more. I can't recommend this classic enough and I hope you continue to find the public because it is a truly special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PRO: <br /> <br /> - Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both amazing to watch. They have never played roles like this before or after and are completely different than usual. You will forget who is playing in a few minutes! <br /> <br /> -Beautiful score <br /> <br /> -It is not dated or campy at all as many films of that decade come out as today <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and quick editing work <br /> <br /> CONS: <br /> <br /> - For an adult audience only <br /> <br /> - The opening scenes are well done, but they could only be a little stronger .
