I think this film is a very funny film and one of the best films of "National Lampoon", but it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about .... Men In White !!! ! The story is a parody of many films including a Will Smith movie, as one might guess, "Men In Black". I will not give the final but it has a very nice ending, it is very funny (Leslie Nielsen-style humor) from beginning to end, especially at the beginning a little when you are on the road picking up the garbage cans (Garbage Cans). In addition, they also have a very nice garbage truck (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene. The acting is not superb, in reality it is not very good, but it is what makes the movie fun, it's a comedy, it gets loose !! I love the plot, partly because it's so far-fetched and partly because it's interesting to see how thin (or should be A-thin) snatch all the other films. I'm a big fan of non-serious spoofing films, but I'm also a fan of the real, and with these films, it's hard to decide which one is the best, the film tears it above all (mentioned earlier I have this review) or the movie itself , but even when you're making a parody of comedy movies, it actually makes it even more difficult, but this movie takes it successfully. The two street cleaners are so funny, it reminds me of a UK TV show called "Little Britain". This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, funniest, best, best storylines, the National Lampoon movie to date !!
