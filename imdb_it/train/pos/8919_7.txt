Who would think that "Helen Crump" by Andy Griffith (Aneta Corsaut) had a film by Steve McQueen in his past? But this is just one of the many strange and wonderful things about the 1950s teenage movie, which could best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows From Outer Space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide "Steve" sounded less picky), a good guy with wild enough to be interesting; the very healthy and understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was interrupted by teenagers, but they are much more disconcerted when they encounter a jelly-like Man-eating What Is It that runs on the earth with its own hot meteor - and starts to devour citizens right and left. But will the adults believe them? Of course not, what they know, they are just children! <br /> <br /> The film is teeny bopper at its very small success. The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many deep looks in their eyes, and the "adult" supporting cast probably says "Kids!" third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film is its creature, which is well imagined, well executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. And although clearly on the economic side (take a look at those miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty well-made film - and there's that little theme song thrown in for good measure. The crowd of over 40 people (including myself) will appreciate the film as a nostalgia, but this will not prevent them from whistling along with the youngest along with his sensitivity in the 1950s - Milk and White Bread and the film would be a great choice for film night for families or for a more sophisticated "adult only". Create lots of jelly cubes for movie snacks! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon reviewer
