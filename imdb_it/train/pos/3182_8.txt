The handsome British airline pilot George Taylor (a solid representation of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (a beautiful and fascinating performance by the adorable Chai Lee). George resumes his health and returns to work. When Emy can't hear George for a long time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While director / co-writer Bitto Albertini actually distributes a satisfying amount of expected tasty nudity and soft-steamy sex, this film is anything but your routine to bask in unpleasant lies. Instead it is a surprisingly reflective, touching and tragic love story between two well-designed and very captivating characters (Chai like Emy Wong is particularly radiant and captivating). The picture starts sparkling and cheerful, but the tone changes radically in a darker and harsher mood about two thirds of the way. Emy's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that George abandoned her is gloomy and unsettling; ditto the surprisingly sad and harrowing end of surprise. Of course, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too silly or trash. Moreover, the sex scenes are rather tasteful and even really erotic. The famous Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice supporting part like George's jealous and uninhibited secretary, Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's refined cinematography offers many surprising shots of exotic places. The funky soundtrack by Nico Fidenco hits the fantastic point. It's worth a look for those looking for something different.
