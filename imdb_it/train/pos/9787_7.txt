This story is beautifully performed. The journey of a young girl is at once sad and moving to find out where she is from and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident, and since she was labeled the "miracle child", she is dyslexic and is finding life a little harsh . Her discoveries along the way interest those closest to her. His relationship with his guardian and his guardian's former boyfriend is handled in a very delicate and sensitive way, and the entire supporting cast is genuine, three-dimensional and credible. Set around a peach canning factory in a small Australian town, this is a warm and gentle film, and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close. After reading some rather superficial comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly cast, and extremely sexy. No, it's not Brad Pitt, but that doesn't mean he's not attractive.
