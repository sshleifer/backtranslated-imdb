This show is fantastic! I've been a fan since it was previewed, and it just keeps me looking ... I've seen some terrible things here, I wish I hadn't done that, BUT, it really shows you how addiction affects all the people involved, not just the employee. You can see all sorts of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to shopping addicts, or the addict to eating disorders. And actually, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have also come through. We have seen established musicians, an NBA player and even young people, who really need help. And since they started showing some follow-up, that was great too. Now, you can see how they have been for a long time after their ep aired. If you haven't checked this, please do it. It's on A & E, and it's great! The new eps is Sunday night at 22:00 EST, if I remember correctly ... then set your TiVo!
