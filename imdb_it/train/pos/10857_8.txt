Johny To does one of his best style exercises here, making a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. The election of the new head of the Yakuza is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> I think violence is wisely used in the context, creating a very strong gang movie. I particularly like the way he tells the story, moving all the roles within the Yakuza family and making sure we see violence as the only way they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> To talk about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of a paused, rhythmic and planned way of making a film. One of the Hong Kong films of the year. It's like hellish affairs, but without the easy action-violence scenes and the confusing plot. Strongly recommended for all lovers of Asian films. <br /> <br /> (excuse my English, better do it in Spanish lol)
