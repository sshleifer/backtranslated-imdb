A very exciting series. I had never seen an exact combination of drama, action, suspense and science fiction ever seen before. I am impressed with every chapter. The script is very intelligent, I don't know how the creators invent all these incredible stories, each character has a strange past, problems, stormy relationships, gives the show the human sense necessary to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are interrelated: the numbers, which they met before without knowing it, and so on. The others, the enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that do not make us lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> JJ Abrams, what did you think about creating this extraordinary story?
