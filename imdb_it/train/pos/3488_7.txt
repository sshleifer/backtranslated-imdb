The WWE needed a savior while Wrestlemania 14 went around. The departure of Bret Hart and the consequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation had left the Vile D-Generation X team unchallenged in the WWE. Their despicable leader Shawn Michaels had stolen Hart's title thanks to Vince McMahon's intervention and, with the help of his Triple H and Chyna cohorts, he systematically eliminated anyone who challenged his supremacy. But a new contender had emerged at the Royal Rumble. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonagement, Austin had DX worried. He was so worried that they would enlist the help of "The Baddest Man on the Planet", Mike Tyson, as a special performer. Austin would have had adversity against him in his match with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first there was an undercard to overcome that started with the Legion of Doom by winning a battle of 15 teams to forget. become NO.1 contenders for tag titles. Actually I had forgotten that this game existed until I reviewed the PPV. Not very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division during that time. <br /> <br /> The next game saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila. The WWE has established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong cruiserweight division in WCW. It was not successful and was the only time the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania. Short game, which lasts about five minutes, and is actually too short to get much. What little they did was exciting and this was a good game that saw Taka keep his title. <br /> <br /> OK, our next game saw member DX Triple H defend the European WWE title, which he had won in Shakes Michaels' fashion on RAW in December and had not defended the PPV, against Owen Hart, the surviving Sun. Triple H got a great entry with the DX band there to perform its acronym. Chyna accompanied Triple H in ringside, but was then handcuffed to WWE commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice match, before Chyna interfered causing a low blow to Hart leading to the Triple H retaining the title. The good game would have been great if it had gone a little longer. <br /> <br /> But of course we wouldn't want to take time away from our next game which saw the real life husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable defeat Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first game of mixed tags at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And honestly, it wasn't worth the wait. Although it is not terrible, the game was not memorable at all. This was the approach of the end of the only race of Mero in the WWE and the main aim was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Next up we saw Ken Shamrock flip and cost the Intercontinental Championship as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock, but then he refused to let go of the submission lock of the ankle lock, resulting in a referee reversing the his decision. This was a short but decent game for what it was. <br /> <br /> Then we saw the first good game of the night while the WWE Tag Team champions of the New Age Outlaws lost their titles for Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun junk game. The decision was canceled the following evening while Cactus and the chainsaw threw the Outlaws into a dumpster backstage, rather than the one used in the game, but this was still a fun game. <br /> <br /> NOw was time for the highly anticipated first meeting between Kane and his brother Undertaker. Kane had cost the WWE championship to the Royal Rumble Undertaker and then "killed him" when he helped Shawn Michaels to block Undertaker in a coffin and set him on fire as revenge for the Undertaker who burned his parents' home and left him horribly disfigured years before. This was a decent game and he told a good story when the Underataker absorbed all that Kane could throw at him and then threw him out with three tombstones to finish the game. <br /> <br /> This left only the main event that saw WWE. The champion confronts Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as a member of the visiting police. Michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble and was notable in this match, despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banished from the back in the early days after interfering from the outside. The game ended with Austin, who ended an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and hit Stone Cold Stunner with the down down. TYson then came into the ring to count the three, celebrating the victory with Austin and then eliminating Michaels after the game. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together and the cat had always played with the mouse. <br /> <br /> This was the last PPV game for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. He helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling world and Tyson's official-looking publicity showed a crucial turning point in the WWE battle with WCW. Austin would become the biggest star in WWE history, and along with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H they led the WWE around the time they would get their highest level of cultural relevance. And it all started here at Wrestlemania 14.
