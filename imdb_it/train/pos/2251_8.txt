I find that the review by Alan Jacobs is very accurate as far as the film is concerned, however I had the opportunity to rent the blockbuster movie DVD with a comment from the BYU editor, the James D'Arc cinema archive. The then LDS prophet Heber J. Grant approved the film by understanding the deviations from the historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith on trial. although the great oratory of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith was nevertheless condemned. So Joseph was killed. Historically Joseph Smith has never been condemned for anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, both killed before the trial.
