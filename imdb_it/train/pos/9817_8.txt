I remember this film. Intense enough for an 11-year-old child. Good editing, I felt bad for the San Bernardo. I would watch it again if it was retransmitted, but the signal is switching to Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm glad I didn't live in that neighborhood. Oh those 70s. What a decade. If they do it again, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent film for pre-pubescent suburban kids. It was very intense. I think it was shot in Los Angeles. Certainly not done in Lodi NJ. The framing with the San Bernardo was the best and obviously the most disturbing image in the film ... and then they left the carcass on the veranda. Rotten children
