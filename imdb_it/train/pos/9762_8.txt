This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows William's work knows that it is a little disconcerting (if not ingenious) but this takes the cake. <br /> <br /> He has two unfortunate ragdolls who have to save their owner's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. The strength of this film lies mainly in its aesthetic quality; his strange drawings of characters, his powerful animation and his sharp contrast between the sweet and the fearful. Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as true rag dolls, floppy and mended, rather than simple comic book versions of the dolls, which made him more credible (at least visually). The animation shines on bringing us the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities that control each end, the hunt for silent films with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, the Greedy. <br /> <br /> Greedy animation alone is perhaps the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something in this animation that leaves you with only your jaw - and every second is something new. Living in what has been called "the Taffy Pit", the Greedy is a huge blob man who lives and eats sweets without mercy. Sing a song that I can't help but feel some sexual nuance, then try to kill Raggedy Ann for her sweet heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many songs. Continue to slow the pace of the film because there are SIXTEEN. There are about six good songs (which should be the only ones) including "I Look, And What II See?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (although they didn't need to let him sing twice), "I Never Get Onough "," Because I Love You "and maybe" I'm Home ". The others seem useless and frankly they are not too surprising to listen to them. <br /> <br /> This is a strange film with strange undertones, but if that's what you're looking for, you won't find better.
