This was, without a doubt, the most disturbing film I've ever seen. The first part of the film, although strange, has a light and fun quality. The journey begins with such a peaceful note that details and emphasizes the beauty of the Appalachian hills. But this is misleading beyond imagination. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the inhabitants of the countryside are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby complain about the pain, and I shudder at the thought. Lewis's leg made me jump. Yet while the film was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral or right to take the life of another individual? What can make us do or not do morality in some cases? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusion we can draw from the film, it is a conquest in its own right (despite some aspects that were chilling real and gruesome).
