They did it. And, boy, did they do it fantastically or what? In the end the BBC brought the Doctor back to our screens on the Saturday night he belongs to! And they did it in style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He's a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but he's also an expert writer, so he knows what others want. Another strength, as perfectly illustrated in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her Rose Tyler character. Finally the Doctor's companion gets a credible story and a strong character. Also nice to see the return of the Autons - a pleasant nod to the Classic Series there. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO: "The End Of The World" - At the beginning of this double bill to show off the TARDIS 'strengths, we end up in a story where special effects are everything! Now they have the technology to create real and credible environments and monsters: no more rubber suits! Even the suggestions at the end of this episode regarding the new Doctor's past - very intriguing to kill all the Time Lords and make it the only one. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THREE: "The Unquiet Dead" - We 've got the future, now leave the past. The first episode written by non Davies is a bit flat in some places, but it is compensated by Charles Dickens of Simon Callow and the sudden turn in the plot when it is revealed that the pitiful Gelf are not so pitiful ... <br / > <br /> EPISODE QUATTRO: "Aliens Of London" - The consequences of the Doctor's actions are completely explored in this series, not least with the repercussions of Rose running away with him. Furthermore, we have our first cliffhanger; certainly not the best of those. Slitheen are an interesting villain, although they may seem too CGI for their sake. <br /> <br /> EPISODE FIVE: "World War Three" - The second part of this story about Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems as the first. Furthermore, the clips of the next episode coming at the end of the current episode are annoying and they ruin it for people. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We had the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we come to good things - the return of the doctor's archenemy. Here I think we can integrate Christopher Ecclestone - he was as brilliant as the Doctor, and no longer so in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he remembers the War of Time and his alien nature almost turning into a Dalek himself . <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "The Long Game" - actually just a story that serves as a prologue to the series finale. Saved by Simon Pegg as the skinny publisher and Tamsin Grieg in a fun cameo. The media are controlling us - it has never been done before, it has ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotions and anguish for Rose, and the real consequences of what happens when you really put the story to iron. Full marks to Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE NINE: "The Empty Child" - I don't find this guy very scary. Sorry, but I don't. It's still a good episode, but the cliffhanger could have been even better: it's those "Next Time" bits that ruin them. John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack, the jerk swindler - he is a good actor who has been around for a while but only apparently noticed now. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: "The Doctor Dances" - Second part of this History of the Second World War - very well done in terms of historical context. A nice positive ending, even if a bit confusing perhaps for younger spectators when the "Mummy" is revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest in the series, but that doesn't mean it's bad. A nice return for the Slitheen and also an interesting study of the character of the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> TWELVE EPISODE: "Bad Wolf" - starts in a rather silly way, with a bit of good humor and a blatant carelessness to the popular television programs about her in Blighty. Things become deadly serious, though, and the revelation is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /> <br /> THRITEEN EPISODE: "Parting Of The Ways" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic doctor in so many ways, David Tennant really has to work with his socks to be as good as he is. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. Oh, and the Daleks are back - to the extreme! God bless CGI, because they would never be able to do it normally! <br /> <br /> Overall: brilliant! 9/10
