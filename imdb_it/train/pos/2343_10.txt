Thank God ABC chose this instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is actually Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if an experience with death and destiny at the beginning of my life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller but surely I like his productions. I also like checkered floors, cakes, talking toys, gravel and other mischievous objects :) While a little "Burtonesque", I certainly think that you appreciate its niche that does not require a park imaginative games. Here we can find the joys and sufferings of childhood and adulthood that break in each of them and actually make sense and make us want to live life to the fullest!
