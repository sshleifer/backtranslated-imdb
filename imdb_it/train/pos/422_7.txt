"The Plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille in its most inaccurate and non-factual form. Establishes parallel plots for an entourage no less stellar than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though Lincoln was already dead at the time when the story takes place. From time to time, DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but just as easily moves away from it in a shameless show and a show. The film is an attempt to support Custer's last position with a pile of fiction that is only vaguely based on people's lives, which were already the product of artifacts and legends. Really, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a rather captivating relic by today's standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the film's harvest, this is a moderately attractive transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There is a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other times. All in all, the quality of the image is therefore in some way inconsistent, but it is never completely wrong or at all ?? just a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related artifacts are minimized and digital anomalies do not distract. The sound is mono but well balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRA: Forget it. It's universal! LOWER LINE: as a pseudo-story painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Is it enough to take his characters and the story with a pinch of salt ?? in some cases ?? an entire box seems more appropriate!
