This film illustrates the worst part of the war that survives, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. My father and his brothers come back from the Second World War. For one of my uncles the war is never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, something like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him, the memories not only lingered but tortured him. He became an alcoholic as did some of my cousins, his children. Jump over 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw it at KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there is something about war that never changes. Idealistic young people and women are not spared from the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against war you will come with more compassion for the soldiers who are trying to do what they believe or have been told is right . <br /> <br /> The coupon of the Vietnam War movie Platoon says it all. "The First Casualty of War is Innocence".
