This film seems to be well remembered when Tom & Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while but, predictably, it becomes sour. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe, a pan and a baseball bat that the two more Butch the dog engage at the beginning and end of the short. I had a lot of fun and you should try catching it on Cartoon Network.
