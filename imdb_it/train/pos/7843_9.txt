I can't believe they took it out of nowhere. Above all, when there are only a few other episodes left. My daughter, my sister and some of my friends loved watching this show. We were so angry when they stopped showing because of so-called assessments. It is not right for the people who were watching this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like them to take an overall vote from all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They could send documents by mail and we, as spectators, could give a general vote on all the programs we watch or have heard. This could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what viewers watch, you can also use it as a tool for free TV and cable TV advertising. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back!!
