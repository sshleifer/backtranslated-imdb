I watch this movie all the time. I saw it with the family from 3 to 87 years old and all in the middle; They all loved it. Really shows the real scenes of a dog and the love and loyalty that you get from a pet. Simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for those who love comedy movies, tear-jerking movies or even just pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes really thought out, and the perfect characters. What I liked about the characters is the true and well mixed personality: Shadow (The oldest, a Golden Retriever) It is the essay, full of the wisdom and mentality of every dog, Chance (the puppy of American Bulldog) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for its owner, the real girly.
