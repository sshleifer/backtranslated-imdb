I'm in front of the TV right now, watching Casomai. It is changing, evolving or rather ... devolving. Start with a marriage of two protagonist's shorts in which their love story is reported. After everything has changed, a child is born, and everything else usually happens in a couple. It is not a special film because it speaks of a normal couple, and normality is the center of this film. He does not want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love story, the story of a couple, and being normal it becomes different from the rest. It's also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is only a few seconds long. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about this, and their opinion is central, opinions create history and destroy it. It's a simple couple story like I said, but it's not boring, just show a couple, it should all be known, it is, but I'm sure each of you will want to know what happens, so don forget to watch the end!
