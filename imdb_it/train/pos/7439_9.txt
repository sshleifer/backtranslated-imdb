The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic work, as was the original poem. The context / setting with the old sailor is beautiful, clear and unpretentious. The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem is perfectly suited to the time / period of the setting and of the work itself, bringing the public into the period with a firm but moving accompaniment, using excellent movement strategies still well won by the producers of pre -MTV and much less apparent in more recent works. (MTV has brought to television and video a static movement that flows through cuts, often irrelevant, from theme to theme without forward movements and without clear relations with the theme or plot.) The voice, the intonation and the vitality of the reading of Redgrave give life to this touching poem with all its fear, conflict and pain. Moreover, the fluid movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasionally the monotone (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the author's version of the sad and ghostly tale of the ancient sailor. This is a must for any love of classical poetry, the sea, a tall story that sounds almost true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and our culture. Who doesn't understand the meaning of an "albatros"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A truly beautiful experience. Thank you Mr. DaSilva for making it alive for us, never to forget.
