An old family story told to two young men by his grandfather is brought back to life 16 years later as he predicted. <br /> <br /> People are killed and blood is spilled and the rats are running everywhere and the naked bodies are very happy. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know that she is not the murderer. Is Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Has Evelyn returned from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is superb in this thriller by Emilio Miraglia, who made just another Yellow, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruined the film was the appearance of several cut frames. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are trying to save Kitty.
