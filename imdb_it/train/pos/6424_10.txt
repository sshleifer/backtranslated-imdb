As a child I remember being nine or ten years old and loving this movie. It was the Bollywood action / comedy film in the round. Obviously it's an imitation of Bad Boys! The whole identity of exchange, but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out the window and then the arrival of colorful scoundrels who dance and sing! The action scenes of the film are not revolutionary scenes but still incredible. The movie is really fun and it was the big comeback that Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a gem as always and this is probably his best work to date, it shines like a side kick and offers the best comic scenes available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs .... The songs are both fun and catchy .............. feeling laughter when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very fun and will make you laugh like "Bade Miah" .... its accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Axes chutki naab re daal' is the best song .............. Hilarious.
