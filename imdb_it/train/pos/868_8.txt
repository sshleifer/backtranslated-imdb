What is very French in this film is the time needed to establish the two protagonists. This might take a little patience, especially since neither is "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition of that. However, once the "shot" comes into action, the film quickly goes forward, perhaps sometimes too quickly. But it's a real roller coaster ride and if you don't look too closely it's all pretty believable. The kind of movie you know Hollywood would have gone wrong.
