This film is absolutely hilarious. His cast immediately shoots with the first frame and takes us on a marvelous ride through gangster spoofing movies. The conflict between brother and brother appears when Johnny's brother becomes a donor of D.A. However, the best character is Johnny's crime rival, the excessively accented Moroni. As Johnny says "That man should be arrested for slaughtering the English language". <br /> <br /> Watch it on video. It's worth a look.
