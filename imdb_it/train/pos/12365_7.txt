I'm surprised no one has said yet that there are two versions of this same movie. The lion's share of the movie in both is identical, but here is where they differ: in one version (the version that I saw most often in broadcast TV), the group of clerics guarding the gateway is made up of the "Confraternity of Protectors" , a fictitious group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the Church. In the other version, which I saw only once on TV, the clerics who guard the door are depicted as priests of the official Church, namely the archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Moreover, in the previous version, in most of the relevant scenes, the clerics are called "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say "Father" like this and so, but the dubbed audio says "Brother" so- and in this way, in this last version, I believe that everyone is defined as "Father". <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a Resumption of the other, with all the scenes of "Brotherhood of the Protector" taken as "Archdiocese" scenes or vice versa. (It reminds me of the scenes of Raymond Burr in "Godzilla"). Off-broadcast TV versions, so no, I'm not imagining this. little more light on the story behind these two versions of the film?
