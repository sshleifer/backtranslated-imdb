Another review has compared this troupe to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also appropriately. Another review exposed on the differences between the comedy we enjoy is not critical and the black comedy, it is also worth considering. <br /> <br /> See it all, all three series. In the end, all the characters are tied and the puzzle pieces fall into place just like a Douglas Adams novel. The details and complexities are staggering. Completely postmodern. Damn funny and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or who have no objectivity. Which stimulates reflection. At the same time literal, figurative and surreal in disturbing ways. The darkest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And most likely the most wonderful thing I've ever seen.
