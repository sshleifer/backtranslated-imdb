1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second RKO film that year is the third film in this collection ?? "Follow the fleet" by Mark Sandrich. This time Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a retired sailor who has just happened to run into the squalid waterfront caf√© where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is gurgling romantic and sweet nothingness in everyone's ear. Yes, you guessed it ?? they are still warm for each other. Only this time the sister of Sherry's spinster, Connie (Harriet Hillard), threatens the entire love story by falling to Bake's robust marine companion, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use 'em up and throw her out kind of guy, forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion on all sailors in general. Irving Berlin offers viewers an immeasurable class with its classic and elegant soundtrack, including the standards 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance;' the second is a scene inspired by suicide that turns into another pas deux immediately recognizable and completely sublime for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer to "Follow the fleet" is a little weaker. The gray scale remains well balanced, but now it is a little thicker with a tonal variation not nearly equal to that of the previous titles. Wheat is still present. So they are age related artifacts. Once you have adapted to the slightly denser and sometimes more gently focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage. The audio is mono but very well balanced. The extras include a featurette, a theatrical trailer and a short subject, but oddly enough ?? no audio commentary. Considering the importance of this film in the general canon of Astaire / Rogers, this is an unusual oversight from Warner Home Video.
