"It wasn't me! It was, uh, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when confronted with the fact that he ended up in Sally's place. I have used this line dozens of times over the years (nobody has yet to believe it, though). <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best ever for pure fun and no credibility. Steven Oliver was perfect for the part of Dugan, so much so that he was in the "Malibu Beach" of 1978 as the same character (although not with the same screen). <br /> <br /> "No one calls Dugan excrement!" is another line for centuries. This classic movie was definitely worth the admission price.
