I saw FIDO on some movie channels and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The film looks like a comic strip that perfectly captures the appearance of the surreal Fifties, you know the healthy decade when they danced with Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the fun of it. The people then were so naive that it's scary and the idea that those clean people would find it normal to have zombies as pets really works here. Congratulations to this Canadian production, the colorful, clear cinematography and excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the boy. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film was not a success. It deserved more recognition. It's much better than those of Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh good. It's still an instant classic.
