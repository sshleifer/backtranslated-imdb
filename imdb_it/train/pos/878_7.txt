Interesting characters, lots of tension. Closer to white and black without being in black and white. I was discouraged by the way the seemingly sympathetic mainstream character, a silent secretary and close to the deaf, was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues, put people on his way to the test and eventually participate in a robbery, and create someone to strike as a bait for his personal expulsion. I am a little discouraged by the tendency for quality films to otherwise portray criminals in a sympathetic way without facing the injury they have done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as cretins. In this film, you never know who the money actually runs off with, or what happens to the innocent wife that the friendly deaf-mute uses to set up the sleazy bar owner to drop the missing loot. Too bad, the film could have been fantastic.
