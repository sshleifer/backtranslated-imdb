Look, if I'm interested in a Nancy Drew book, what I'd do is take a book and read it. I'm not. Since I remember reading the people who ruined the films because it wasn't like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent films in book form. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won an Oscar - "The book was better". When I saw To Kill a Mockingbird, "the book was better". Now a group of people is upset once again because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win any Oscars - if it ever becomes one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm telling you to give the film a break. It's film, not paper. As a film, I found Nancy Drew pretty funny - with cameos by Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on the O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I see Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I like her work more than most of Julia and Eric; his character remains consistent throughout the film and reacts well with the conflict. A carefree film in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is beautiful from time to time. <br /> <br /> I give him ten stars because I really liked the movie, I'd like to see it again and I'll probably buy it on a publication DVD.
