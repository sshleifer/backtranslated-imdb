Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking gangster who turns to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who attends a billiard room and spends his free time envying Frankie. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where they form a bond that may not be a friendship, but will do so for now. <br /> <br /> This film came to me with the title of "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see that an alternative name is "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would help sell the film in most effective way. I assume it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" but what do I know? I saw him shortly after another Italian criminal film, "Violent Professionals", and I must say that the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> Italians have always been behind Americans in their budget and production values, which is a real shame about this film. It is considered a "grinder" film, which unjustly demotifies him into a b-movie (or worse). With a cleaner sound and an image, this may have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and the actors) better than average and unlike "Violent Professionals" the plot is pretty clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or movie crime you should try this. A film about the crowd that comes from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) It's the best you can ask. Of course, it's not "The Godfather", but it shouldn't be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy action movie ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, okay, not really. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this film made me want to see more films by the director and the main cast. Movies in addition to "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual cult films. What could be more fun than discovering a lost classic?
