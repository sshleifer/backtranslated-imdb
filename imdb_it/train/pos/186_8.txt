There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comic roles. William Haines could act, and you can see why he was one of the most popular men on the screen. (Until a potential scandal forced him to leave the business). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit trivial, but so beautifully managed that you don't notice it. King Vidor's management is one of the main reasons for this. The producer? The boy's genius, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about creating movies, and you get to see the process as it was in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors they direct and the actors they emigrated. You get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin walks around like himself, looking for an autograph. See also Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are just names and old photographs. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you're not a fan of silences, take the time to take this movie whenever you can. It is truly a fantastic journey through time.
