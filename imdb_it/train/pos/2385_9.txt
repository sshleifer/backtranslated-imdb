In the old spot for empty audio cassettes, the tag line was "is it real or is it Memorex?" The same could be said for the events of this episode - a compilation and remix of "The Cage", the first Star Trek pilot. Mr. Spock has skillfully commanded the ship to take him to the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain who was burned and paralyzed, to return there. Why the finagling? Because having any contact with Talos IV calls for a death sentence. Because this is so it is never explained - this annoyed me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. After obtaining the ship to go to Talos IV, Mr. Spock turns to Dr. McCoy (the senior officer present, Captain Kirk is off the ship) for arrest and says: "The accusation is mutiny, Dr. I never received the order to take over the ship. "What follows is a court-martial in which - thanks to the Talosians - we learn why it was so important (in addition to the obvious paralysis) that Captain Pike arrived at Talos IV even at the risk of Mr. Spock's death. The illusions created by the Talosians, the background music and the whole plot are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie in the role of The Keeper (the Talosian head) is wonderful. Call me a sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but it was perfect! The Talosians, having given up almost all physical activities and becoming almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they're male or female and it doesn't matter. This episode, more than any other in the series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds out there and that there are such advanced civilizations! What a beautiful thing if that were so! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I also have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. Meg Wyllie LOOKS like an alien and I DO NOT mean it rudely.
