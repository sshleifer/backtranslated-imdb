The undoubted evidence of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn wildly comic and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a beautiful face man has! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and rather disturbing and emotionally intense in the parts (especially towards the end) but it is also strangely moving and succeeds on many levels. However, I felt that the film revolved around the luminous performance of Peter O'Toole and I'm sure I wouldn't have liked even half of it if it hadn't been there.
