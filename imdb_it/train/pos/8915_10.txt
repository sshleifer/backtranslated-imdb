THE BLOB is a great horror film, not only for the vividly horrible images of its almost unstoppable title, which dissolves the flesh, but because it presents a real social message. It is, in many ways, a "wellness horror film". The clever plot is helped immeasurably by the solid performances of the entire cast. The two romantic protagonists, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the process. They are misunderstood but very well-intentioned young people, and it is very easy to support them. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-company film, and its young delinquents cause problems mainly out of boredom, not out of some malicious flaw. Steve McQueen's rival almost seems to be an enemy in the early stages of the process, but he quickly joins McQueen's campaign to save the city from the sinking invader once he sees McQueen's seriousness. In this way, a situation of character that at first sight seems to be a cartoonist suddenly develops depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> The authorities' initial skepticism about the wild assertions of children is proven wrong - and once the threat is recognized by all, all the conflict within the society disappears. This unification of purpose and the validation of adolescent "troublemakers" become official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into the school to get the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob. On any other day, breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent - on this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. At this turning point, it is clear that there are no dividing lines between the young and the old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film in that it recognizes the perception of a "generation gap" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real and, given a real crisis, people will naturally come together to restore order. "The Blob" is a perfect tonic for the type of depression that generally comes with the vision of "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> Much has been made of the economic but innovative (and effective!) visual effects film. They are undeniably intelligent. Many of the tricks that challenge gravity we see that Blob's performance was achieved with miniaturized sets designed to be rotated. The camera was typically connected to the sets in a very "locked" position (the lights had to be connected in a similar way so that the lighting remained fixed while the room was being turned from one side to the other). These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time while the room turned slowly: the silicone blob emanated very slowly and its action had to be accelerated. In a sense, it was similar to stop motion photography, but using a silicone blob rather than an articulated puppet. Even today, the effects are surprising and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A very good film with an instrumental sounding title, THE BLOB is a must see.
