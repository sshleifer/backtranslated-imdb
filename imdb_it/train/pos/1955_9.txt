Just the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors besides the one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a group of well-mannered people, playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a book about a murder. She plays the female psychopath quite well while using her broad sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the last black widows. Tramell is used in the dark places of society and freely participates in sadomasochistic factions in the "never visited after sunset" side. From the beginning, there is nothing less than an R rating here from just dialogue. The stone could also be described as a sort of female Hannibal Lecter, a femme without fatal emotions without the eating plan.
