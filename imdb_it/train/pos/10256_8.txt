The first episode of this infamous horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up as an amateur tape for camcorders, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. Presents a woman kidnapped by a band of men dressed in black who torture her for several days before killing her. The unfortunate victim is savagely beaten and caught with raw meat before having her nails pulled out with pliers, her hand broken with a hammer, her eyes pierced with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the most nauseating scene, the woman's kidnappers burn her with hot water and release live worms in burns. The series received a lot of publicity when the American actor Charlie Sheen, believing that the series contained a real murder, tried to ban its distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the movies were just what most viewers seemed to be: sick re-creations using unpleasant but obvious special effects. Created imaginatively by the acclaimed Japanese comic artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to free everything except from the most tolerant rooms. But the cheetahs probably won't find anything special.
