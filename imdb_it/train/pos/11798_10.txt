I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's absolutely full of fun !!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors like William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) I never thought that an actor could capture "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As for me, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie captures its best performance !!!
