Channel 4 is a channel that allows more bad stuff than any other channel, this show was definitely a bad one. The presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show, the four-time BAFTA winner and the British Comedy Award (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was simply the perfect gay host for a show like this. There was one or more famous celebrities in the middle. Basically they had an adult idea that would have offended, humiliated or humiliated the guest, but some are not for the faint of heart. They had women playing the recorder with their parts, men using their cocks to play a xylophone, women moving up in the bathtub, men with or without trousers under their kilt and many other gross ideas but hilarious. This is for adults only, but have fun! He won the BAFTA twice for the best show (program or series), he won the British Comedy Awards for the best comedy entertainment program (also nominated), the best comic talk show, he won an Emmy for episode n. 18 (?), And won the National Television Awards twice for the Most Talk Talk Show. It was number 52 of the 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!
