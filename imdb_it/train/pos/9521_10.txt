I think this film is brilliant. There are many reasons why, but these are some of them 1) the good acting of Tom and Tyler 2) brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of genius 3) I thought the ending was a good twist because I wouldn't never expected that in the end all the merit of Sam Mendes. as well as these 3 points the shape of the film of the film is good. I am a college film student and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I have seen in many years. I would just like to say a big thank you to all the people involved in making this film. Finally, I'd like to say that the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where John Rooney kills himself, it's just pure brilliance to shoot the scene in silence until John Rooney says "I'm glad it's you" is much better so I think why the viewer creates his own sound and that sound is totally different for every spectator simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this 16-year-old Ross Kirk comment
