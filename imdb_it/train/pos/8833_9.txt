I was fascinated by the title, so during a small period of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity ...), I stood looking at him. I then checked my TV listings and looked at it again! There is a very obvious realization that came to my mind when I saw this film - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers from all over the world are practically the same. The characters of Belgrade children could have been transported, say, somewhere in the American Midwest during the same time period, and linguistic differences aside, they would be impossible to distinguish from any of the local teenagers of that era. Certainly they showed the same growing concerns and concerns, apart from politics: music, sex, movie idols, music, alcoholism, sports, music ... In fact, the same things that occupied my time growing up in Southern California 70's . <br /> <br /> This was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it all very pleasant. Even the characters, especially the young actors, were completely credible. I will not say that this is the "Yugoslavian American Graffiti", but I will say that it is well suited to the theme films of the 1950s.
