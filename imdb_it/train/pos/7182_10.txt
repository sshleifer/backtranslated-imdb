I thought that for a first episode of a first series it went really well. It was really fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime for anyone to say that it was bad because it seemed like the right time. I find it really boring when people say it's not historically correct because it should be a Saturday night entertainment show, not a boring story documentary, so I think the costumes and settings were perfect. A brilliant start and I'm going to love what comes next !! I talked to many people in my school and they love the show! we all think it's a brilliant entertainment and has great stories to it.
