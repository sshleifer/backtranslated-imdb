I saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI for the first time at its premiere during the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! The blood has simply blown us away with its pure verve, blood, vitality, blood, excitement, blood, total campiness, and even more blood, and all in SO GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who love all those Japanese chambara samurai and ninja movies, you MUST DEFINELY SEE THE BLOOD!
