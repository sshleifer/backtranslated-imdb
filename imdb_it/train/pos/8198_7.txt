Dirty Harry has to track down a rape victim who draws revenge by shooting his assailants in the guts before killing them. Probably a more appropriate punishment would be to let them live after the initial blow and let them suffer forever as she and her sister ... Anyway ... an action-packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The head rapist, played by Andy Drake, is appropriately cowardly and eventually gets his punishment (of course!). Not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original Dirty Harry.
