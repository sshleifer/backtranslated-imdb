"Saving Grace" is never incredibly fun, but it does offer some nice laughs and I really enjoyed it. Brenda Blethyn is a good actress and does a good job in portraying Grace, who uses marijuana to pay off her huge debts. The supporting cast also does a great job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a small fun role. Only the premise is attractive. The idea of ​​a woman on the hill growing and smoking a pot sounds pretty funny. And the film sounds wisely from time to time with the premise. Sure, there are flat moments, like the one where two old women swap Grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and start throwing kids around in the store where they work. That was a brainless gag that didn't take off completely. The tone of the film is low and occasionally boring, but I had enough laughter to give this English an import tip. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
