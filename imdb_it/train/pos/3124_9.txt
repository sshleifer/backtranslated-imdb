Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he just did. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in New York emphasizes the agency's response to what just happened on the screen. An American flag stands proudly in the center of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, he slips out of focus as his plan goes towards a morally doubtful territory, as if he didn't want to be associated with the course of action that man government decides is necessary in the interests of national security. <br /> <br /> This shot effectively captures the atmosphere of the film. In addition to interpreting Bourne's research to find out how Jason Bourne became, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interest of stability and security. <br /> <br /> It is also probably the best film you will see at the cinema this year. <br /> <br /> It's so intense. Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine) "This is not a newspaper story, this is real" and you almost believe it in the audience. The camera shakes, but it remains constant enough to allow you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to evade his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem like they're the characters they portray, instead of being only actors who perform well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally frantic and well choreographed that they seem instinctive rather than planned in the slightest movement; stunt work is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br /> The pace is simply incredible. Continue to advance towards its conclusion, but not so fast as to let yourself struggle to rebuild the plot; the script provides the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next action set-up. While they are often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they are loaded with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is so focused on advancement that you can't help but be swept away by it. <br /> <br /> With its intense action sets, brilliant plot and intelligent examination of decisions taken in the name of national security, the Bourne series is the one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our era. Ultimatum is its peak.
