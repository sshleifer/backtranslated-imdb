In this documentary we meet Roger, the wealthy manager of a factory in China that produces beads and other trinkets sold and traded at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but interviews with four of them tell another story. The squalid lives of the girls are shown in sharp contrast to the bizarre excesses of the Mardi Gras itself. Director David Redmon should be commended for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a Chinese factory, and for the landing of a revelation interview with the head of the US company that imports and sells the beads. The film is told in a compelling way and clearly serves its purpose as a window on what lies behind those ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
