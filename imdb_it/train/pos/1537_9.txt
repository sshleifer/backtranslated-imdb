The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents for her father's birthday, which sometimes always has some sort of tragedy, the question is just what will it be this year, and you will be surprised ... It is an extremely well composed film, with a story that it has a perfect balance between humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You are happy, you hurt yourself and basically everything in between. Finally you can't help but fall in love with Mia (if you are a boy I believe (the main actress)) She is an extremely well chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
