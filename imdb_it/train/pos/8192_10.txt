This two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned. Certain pieces of history have been torn from previous films, but which television programs do not do so these days. What we got here was a beautiful science fiction story. A great monster (really scary) imprisoned at the base of a deep hole, some superb aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens that the revived series invented, a set of fundamentally understanding and credible human characters (complete with a pair security people "expendable" without name in the true fashion of Star Trek), some philosophical themes on a large scale (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), and some special high-level effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of this.
