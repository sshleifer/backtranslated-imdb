Excellent. Gritty and true portrait of pioneer pioneer life in the western plains with emphasis on the role and role of women. A moving film, created with love and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; never made money. Certainly not the Hollywood and romanticized version of pioneer life.
