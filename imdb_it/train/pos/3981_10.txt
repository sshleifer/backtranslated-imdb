This is my fourth short Joe McDoakes that I've seen and so far the most fun. In this, Joe takes lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, by the way), he asks Jack Carson for indications that both become confused. Then he meets the actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks in his most normal voice that is not too far from his next Geroge Jetson and arrives on the set where he automatically upsets the director. I will stop here and say how much fun it was and I was fascinated by the cameos of the films that came almost to the end. The final scene was particularly exciting, so on this note, go to YouTube if you want to watch so you want to be in Picutres!
