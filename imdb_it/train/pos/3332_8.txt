Yes, commitment. Let's say "Fever Pitch" could lead you to believe that it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you don't have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this Farrelly Brothers photo. But of course, if you are, you will like it even more; with all the references (rather precise, I would say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet story; from the Curse of the Child and all that is attributed to him, including those two words that CANNOT be pronounced in front of a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon play two people who, as a rule, might have second thoughts about joining a relationship: the successful workaholic who is also a rich meeting with a school teacher? The fact is that the character of Fallon wins Barrymore's heart by being fun, caring, sweet and absolutely perfect. But her friends ask her a logical question: if he is such a guardian, why is he still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He has been so busy with his team since his uncle passed his season tickets for Sox; He has never lost a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And that delicate balance, how much the workaholic is willing to give up his boyfriend's obsession; and how much that crazy baseball teacher is willing to compromise to keep the OTHER love of his life, is this movie. <br /> <br /> At first you might think that the sports obsession parts of the movie are exaggerated for a comic relief. Well, I'm sad to admit it, I'm not. I, as a huge Houston Astros fan, can say that they are all true. I would try in every way available to see every game of Stros; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet. I read the sports section of the Chronicle every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, Minute Maid Park gift shop; with a wardrobe full of Astros tools, including 5 shirts, 20 shirts and you know the rest. The character of Fallon even has the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was as credible as the faithful Red Sox faithful, though he could make it without becoming a cartoon (thank God Adam Sandler was not in it); and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage the passions of others. <br /> <br /> I would say it will be a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be among the best films in history; but it certainly breaks a mold in the genre and is quite attractive for men and women.
