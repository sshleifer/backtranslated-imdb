What a delight! a film made with great skill that has so much charm and a well-being factor that many romantic comedies are missing. Is Einstein brilliantly played by Walter Matthau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable ?? better than how I saw it in those films in front of Tom Hanks ?? like the young mathematician who struggles to be recognized. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and to feel solidarity with her immediately, and as a young woman it is easy to understand what must have crossed Ed (Tim Robbins) in pursuing his true love. There is a universal fascination in these emotions, even if I.Q. keeps everything light, fun and well tied. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not heavy, but if you look there are some subtitles. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist and yet he was a great spiritualist; his sayings as something like "If it's not impossible, then why do it?" to suggest that he is a believer in achieving higher goals beyond his immediate understanding. In this film there are questions about what an accident really is? as if Albert is the interlocutor of his cunning bastards in guessing Catherine far from James rigid and lipless (Stephen Fry who gives life to this cartoon character and one cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling ) counts. How many interviews happen in our lives that we do not see and present as very strong? <br /> <br /> And of course, we would like to think in real life, despite what we often see of people who know that we Edwards receive the Catherine and James who must learn to thaw frozen water in their veins. How nice to know that it could work in the innocent (and disturbing, exclusively Caucasian) land of fiction of the Eisenhower era.
