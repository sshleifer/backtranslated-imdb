For a low-budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who is now the protagonist of the television program "Dragnet", is sexier than ever. The locations were ideal for the Ganster plot and the director shows his talent by assuming many roles for his project. Obviously this low-cost movie could use better editing transitions and more special effects for weapons scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. Although this film has its share of problems, such as continuity, I must say that I would rent the director's next film. If you are a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's comment.
