I went to see Fever Pitch with my mom, and I can say we liked it so much. It was not the typical romantic comedy in which someone was pining for each other, and blah blah blah ... You were not waiting for the first climate kiss or that they finally came together. It was more real, because you saw them through the report, rather than the whole movie was about their being together. People could actually relate to the film, because they don't look like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really fun, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I would certainly recommend it!
