I couldn't wait to get my hands on this when I read about Fred Astaire collaborating with George Burns and Gracie Allen in a film with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and Gershwins music. Definitely worth seeing, but the cohesive quality of Fred & Ginger's films is missing. <br /> <br /> History would probably be the best to read in a Wodehouse book, where humor looks better. Some of the plays are definitely painful to watch (especially the boy and the damsel). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could have danced, but he does it in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand on one of those rotating discs in an amusement house? Imagine yourself dancing with the tapdance on one with high heels! It goes wonderfully with Astaire and adds a lot to the general quality of the image. <br /> <br /> Several beautiful songs, particularly amusing, are Nice Work if you can get it and Stiff Upper Lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and revisit the funhouse dance as soon as the credits ran.
