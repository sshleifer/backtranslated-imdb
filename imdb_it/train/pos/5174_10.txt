I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never admit it! Every aspect of human emotion is captured in such a magical way by acting, the script, the direction and the general feeling of this film. It's been a long time since I saw a film that made me choke with laughter, reflect on sadness and feel every feeling that comes from this excellent work! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: are you listening ???
