Great voices, many adventures and intelligent dialogues make this film a great film. The addition of the "character" to the three animals in the head gives the story much more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older man, Shadow, and the young hellraiser, Chance. Previous versions of this film were unable to give animals any real personality or motive, which is perfectly done here. Sally Field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this movie like the proud feline, Sassy. Great contrast between the perspectives of the cat and the dog on life, and the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent. There is also an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with children. Hats off to Disney.
