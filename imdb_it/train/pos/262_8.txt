*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "The Divers", is really interesting. All I barely knew was that it would involve the history of Nazism, underwater scenes and everyone would speak in Danish. But I decided to check it out for a reason, the fact that the story evolved around a German submarine sunk during World War II. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially the wrecks on which you can dive. So I was a little skeptical about the Danish side, but I reasoned that the diver could evaluate that part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always so good and I'm not sure how big the budget was, I was, to say the least, very skeptical. <br /> <br /> After seeing I was ... surprised. <br /> <I have had some reflections on inadequate actors, given that some are very young, the two main actors in particular. This was not a problem, both behave very well. Like the other actors, who mostly consist of people between 50 and over. This makes interesting some interactions between young and old, often not visible on the screen. Not unique in any case, but rather rare. And all is well. <br /> <br /> As for the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But this was not a problem, it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspected that there would be internal shots as well as external submarine shots of the submarine. Having decided that their budget was low, I thought this could be adequate at best and it was terrible after all. Once again I was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German subtitles, I knew how the subtitle should look, especially inside, and I wasn't disappointed. The team did some serious research. Everything is alright. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than me will watch this movie only to see some scenes of the sub-wreck, so I feel I have to issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. It is a subtitle for special purposes. But to give you a hint as to what to expect, it is a cross between a Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese transport submarine similar to I-52. It's a good design and a nice wreck. <br /> <br /> The setting is on an island or Danish peninsula, I don't remember. It's summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the arrival of summer like they do every year. Their grandfather is a sailor of all sorts. The cinematography is quite beautiful, many summer scenes at the island docks, some new adolescent love, a beautiful underwater climate and a general "perfect" feeling. Once again, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Through the island some suspect visitors are obtained, a group of men hires one of the boats, an old minesweeper and his crew. One of the visitors, a man in his fifties, has the German eagle and the swastika tattooed on his back. All the elders of the island remember when a German sailboat was sunk towards the end of World War II and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who sought the submerged boat shortly after the German corpses started to float ashore in 1945. No submarine was ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO WAIT <br /> <br /> The key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teenage love, conspiracy and ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> *** ATTENTION - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect some elements of the supernatural to appear in this film and it caught me off guard. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, he nevertheless adapted well to the plot and posed no problem. It's not like "From dusk to dawn" where everyone turns into vampires towards the end. This is a bit more subtle. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: Really a good movie, I gave him an 8. Some due to the fact that it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later I learned that he had a reasonable budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I would have given him a 7 or an 8. Definitely worth it. Yes, the story of a child in a sense, but then again a mature story. It has a lot of suspense and a great aura of adventure, which I found very attractive. And, again, cinematography is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
