The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than playing roles as blond and stereotyped usually, he plays a smart, smart, tired character of the world. It doesn't play a huge role but does a great job playing Lois Harlan like a tired woman, even though she is used to covering her boss's rumors.
