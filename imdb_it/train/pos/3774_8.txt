In the sequel to the brilliant adventure of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future, while the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to the earth to kill Bill and Ted humans, in order to change the future. <br /> <br /> In a great comedy match, Winter and Reeves excel at delivering delightful public humor in this fun sequel. Although the sharpness of the first is lacking, Bogus Journey still has the great slogans and dialogue of the main couple, not to mention an exhilarating performance by William Sadler, which brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the gruesome reaper. Watch the game sequences, the best moment of the whole film, but one of the many techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although it is still full of humor, this film has a more dramatic film about it, with more serious stakes and riskier situations. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a large size and another amiable feature. The creators also extend the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and paradise that is strongly symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is back in place with the use of that incredible time machine, although again a bit confused in points with the use of timing, and objects and situations are placed before it happens in the present, like is evident in the last couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time it was a real joy because I enjoyed the jokes and the story more, and even if the jokes and the plot are not as strong as its predecessor , Bogus Journey has pretty good motivations, jokes and a fairly consistent plot to make it a good family movie.
