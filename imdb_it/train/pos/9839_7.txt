Hmmm, yes this episode is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of bad writing and acting in parts. I think the good above wins the villain. <br /> <br /> I love origami parts and the great "twist" at the end. I love that scene when Michelle confronts Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes from Season 1. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated episodes of reincarnation, yet I've always liked them. They are not the best, in terms of writing. but the theme really interests me, <br /> <br /> I'll give it a TRE star, but if the writing were a little more coherent, I'd give it FOUR.
