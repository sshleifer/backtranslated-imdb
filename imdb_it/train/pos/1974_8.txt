I think the reason for all the diarrhea believers in this movie is that most people want Sharon Stone to be around 50 and get naked while playing sexy. Nobody cared when the Golden Girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussed their first orgasm, but seeing someone putting menopause with digital pleasure while driving I guess it's too much for someone to handle. Let's face it, it looks good, it is light years warmer than my mother who is the same age! It is not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but since the beginning of the century all the spectators seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be. It is an erotic thriller that is both erotic and electrifying and is the continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell who helped kick off this sequel. Fans of the first film want to see more than that icy queen of ice. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to Britain for sure. The score is also surprising. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is some exaggeration on the part of some characters, but there is a brilliant work by David Morrissey that is practically unknown. <br /> <br /> There is a setback in the fact that the script is practically the same as the first film that connects only a psychiatrist instead of the policeman. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the film to be reduced even more, which takes away the guilt and pleasure that the story is famous for. <br /> <br /> At the very least it's fun and fun to watch it, and that's just the intentions of the movie. So, if you have beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before throwing up your projectile vomit?
