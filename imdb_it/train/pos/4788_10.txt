This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen: I shone all over the film. Music and film kept the spell when little was happening on the screen. The slow pace was set by the way of traveling (a lawn mower with a large trailer) and was maintained by the images and background sounds and the slow life of the other characters. <br /> <br /> actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually turned into the characters. Sissy Spacek gave a moving interpretation to a somewhat disabled daughter who suffered a lot but made progress, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast to perfection and magnificently became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving old man who crosses Iowa to visit his brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and this seemed to bring the best in the people he met along the way. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes the importance of the family for this man and, hopefully, for all of us. I look forward to seeing him again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film demonstrates his ability as a director. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79 he was the oldest candidate for that award.
