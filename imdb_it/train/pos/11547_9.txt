and laugh out loud in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of the film is well documented, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in the immediate vicinity. <br /> <br /> This is unquestionably the best film of Lemmon and Matheau as co-stars, and the interaction between the sloppy Oscar and the Felix OCD is classic. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Oscar puts together a double date, leaves the room briefly, and returns to look for Felix and the two girls who cry are inestimately funny. <br /> <br /> For all fans of smart comedies, The Odd Couple is a film that lets you see everything.
