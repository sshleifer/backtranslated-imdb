Released two years before my birth, this Oscar-winning film has it all: sumptuous Technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb Gershwin wall-to-wall music, superior choreography, a lighter-than-air script and great Kelly performances Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood no longer does that. Surely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard by which I judge all the other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
