I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, sister of Jackie Kennedy and cousin of these women, encourages the Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a movie. Certainly they could be considered the "skeletons" in the family wardrobe. The extra features of the DVD include several contemporary designers who acknowledge some of their ideas to these strange women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion will find these designers' discussion fascinating. (ie "Are they crazy? Or am I missing something?"). This film is hard to find. Netflix does not have it. Facets, though.
