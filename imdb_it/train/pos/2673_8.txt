The Journey of Hope (1990) talks about a journey that many nomadic and poor Turks make so they can live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as the westerners who will give up their lives and their lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are scammed by greedy scammers who make their living by paying huge taxes for desperate people who find themselves in a no-win situation. A family faces the cold, the treacherous mountain group and predatory criminals only to discover that there is not always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists all over the world, not just in America. Some people tend to forget it. A broken heart of a film that will leave you wondering why in the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
