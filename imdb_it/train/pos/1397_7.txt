"Shore Leave" is mostly a Star Trek media adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode, though. I simply think this is not the best representation of what the show has to offer fans. It's light fun, nothing more. However, I am glad to see that such a TV program had enough common sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew some free time, and a landing party is teleported to a planet that looks like the perfect vacation spot. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some moments of action and tension, but most of the story is reproduced through laughter. Good, but not exceptional.
