This is simply a classic movie in which human voices from animals are actually what thoughts are. I don't know if my video copy has a missing scene but it never shows how the dogs came out of the pit. It also shows an instinct for animal survival and localization skills. Put the humans in the same position and the helicopters would be out. For once, an original film is enhanced by a remake while the voice-over for the first has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this type because people's use should have made the story more alive by turning it into murder, showing that, after all, animals are more interesting than people
