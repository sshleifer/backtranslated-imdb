Those French and those Germans certainly have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that the Kamerdaschaft or the Cameratism in translation took place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would besiege Germany and begin his plans to conquer the world, France being a victim of its ambitions. But these are times of serenity with respect to the future. A group of miners at the border tries to cross France to go to work. They are rejected and later to a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a scene well thought out and written, a troupe of German miners decides to come to the rescue. A simple story, isn't it? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I'm not sure if this is his first sound film or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. It is not fussy, but it brings a harsh realism to the test. There is also a flashback of a World War II event that recalls the meaning of this story. Presumably based on a real event, the film does the events with pride with immediacy and subtlety. Smetimes, that's what a movie should be.
