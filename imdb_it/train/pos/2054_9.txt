When I heard about the title, I thought of "The Simpsons", just like so many other reviewers, but when I saw the cast, I was completely stunned, that so many great character actors would really be in this! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character, McBain. He is rescued from a Vietnam prison camp by some of his friends, one of whom is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who shares a COST OF DOLLAR CENTO with McBain (the soldiers of Vietnam are apparently laden with money), and the he says he can do the favor back to him if he ever gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels in Colombia, trying to get rid of their diabolical dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina goes to the aid of McBain. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good friends from Vietnam to help him. First there is the tough black guy, Eastland, played by Steve James of "American Ninja", who was also in the previous film by director James Glickenhaus, "The Exterminator", where the real name of the exterminator was Eastland, coincidence? I do not think so. There are also many other references to The Exterminator, among which the most remarkable is that McBain himself wears a welder's mask when Christina sees him for the first time, while he is working on a welding job at the top of a bridge! <br /> <br /> The other guys from Vietnam-pack are: The rich man who can afford every kind of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there's the doc , Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't seem to be the kind to whom the IMDb connects, and I haven't seen it in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there's the cop , Gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfactory work, is played by Thomas G. Waites, which some of us may remember from The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other great roles, we find Luis Guzm√°n (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), a small drug dealer who can't find a decent job. Also, there is Dick Boccelli in the role of the drug boss who is hung on a crane on top of a roof by the McBain band, almost exactly the same way he was hung on a meat grinder by John Eastland in the EXTERMINATOR-film! Now, I haven't seen Glickenhaus "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I'm almost ready to bet half dollar bills that Boccelli hung in that movie too! <br /> <br /> Well, let's get back to the plot of this movie .. they go to Colombia and save the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is fantastic, and the action scenes are very well done, and you're never bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended for all action lovers!
