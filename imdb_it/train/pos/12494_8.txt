Finally an independent film that offers really great scares! I see most of the horror movies that come out ... Theatrical, Straight-to-DVD, cable, etc ... and many of them suck ... some are watchable ... even less are actually good ... Dark Remains is one of the best. I took a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the public loved it ... and my wife and I had a great time! Not having actors of name, I assume that the budget of this film was quite low, but you wouldn't know ... the film looks fantastic ... the acting works totally for the film ... the story is good ... and the fears are great! While most filmmakers focus exclusively on fear, they often forget the character's story and development, two things that help deliver scars more efficiently. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that the character and the story are important. It develops both to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and so you are more scared when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watch horror movies that cost from $ 80 million to $ 5000 to do, I find "Dark Remains" to be one of the gems out there. Watch this movie!
