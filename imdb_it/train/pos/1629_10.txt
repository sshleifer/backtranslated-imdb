This movie is so cheap, it's captivating !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) he provides the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in the history of cinema. I own 2 copies of this video on video ... on one, Ralph Macchio is captured actually bursting in the background at Major Vaugn while he is prey to "Hash". Obviously they forgot to change this error out of the movie, but it goes to show how funny the film is, when the actors themselves can't keep their faces serious !!!
