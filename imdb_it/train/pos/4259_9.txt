Solino really moved me with his deeply drawn characters. Despite being a simple story of rivalry between two brothers, it was not just hatred or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was the way I could identify with the feelings that Gigi was going through especially when he had to bring his mother back to his hometown in Italy and miss attending the film festival awards ceremony. Seeing this character struggling hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end, when he still makes an attempt to reach his father, he was so brave. And like in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach their children. I could also identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while he was more self-confident and older brother, had so many insecurities. A really nice film that made me laugh and cry.
