Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical things, but this put me under the skin (excuse the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go beyond the heights and as satisfying as they are in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I find myself feeling a lot of hatred for the screwer and so much sympathy for the "seer", I felt myself shivering and feeling pangs of disgust in certain situations that it is really rare and delicious for a somewhat tired horror viewer like myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but they turn out to be a tribute rather than an imitation. It is a heavy piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but I like being attacked by a film for once. This piece carries it and is not appreciated. I really enjoyed this. DO NOT watch while eating pudding.
