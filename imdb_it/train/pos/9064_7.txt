I sat with my children while we watched this movie. We all found it to be a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth grade bully starts doing things with him and that's what leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy only has so much time to eat 10 worms or something. From this point the bully and his friends try to invent bad ways to cook, fry or bake the worms to try to make Billy sick so that he will lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy remains strong and eats his way of becoming more and more appreciated by everyone, even by his bully friends. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you if the bet will win or not ... you just have to watch it to find out, but you will think that if you like good family movies you will like this. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this film is not just for boys, I have all the daughters and I loved it.
