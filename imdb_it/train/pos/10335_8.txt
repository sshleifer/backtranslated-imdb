The only reason I gave this movie to 8 out of 10 is because there are few films, in my opinion, that are perfect. This small image B is a tense, well told story. I've always been fascinated by Alexander Knox, but I've seen very few films. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without an ounce of remorse. Performance is one of the most chilling performances I've ever seen. Since the Second World War, the actors who played the Nazis or other evil types in the movies have occasionally been nominated for an Oscar. I imagine that since it was created during the war, the Academy felt that honoring a performance like this would be like honoring evil. But Knox does that kind of performance - a man so bitter and consumed with guilt that he doesn't think he'll hurt others. I still can't get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the gibbet filbert or the social butterfly, was chosen to play the best performance I've ever seen. Perhaps it is not a worthy Oscar, but the best of his career. Nothing against her; I liked those "light" roles she often played. But here he proves to be up to the heaviest drama. <br /> <br /> If you like stories of human dramas, or stories about the fate of those who have suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this little movie.
