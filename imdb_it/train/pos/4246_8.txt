In this film, produced by JUST while the production code was being applied, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the "Kitty" orderly. The Missouri girl starts with the girls who get on a train, with Eadie promising herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband, remaining intact, some in the process. It doesn't take long to meet with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, he was the kindly Doctor in the Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the movies "Andy Hardy".), But not everything is as it seems .. The censors must have LOVED the Harlow's phrase "A girl could not accept a gift as expensive as that from a gentleman unless he was engaged." Later, someone says "You know we've never been alone together" and Eadie replies "Yes, and we won't be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, rising, who comes to his aid when trouble comes to look for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares "You should unsubscribe from your list - I'm not a gentleman" ... I wonder what this line would have been like just a couple of years before the Hayes code came to town. What was he really saying? Carol Tevis appears to be the keen "Baby Talker" as listed in the IMDb titles. It seems that he was alone in the entertainment world from 1931 to 1939, with "Munchkin" in Wizard of Oz the last part he played. Funny and casual, while the girls chase the men around the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard, who was a 1920 Olympic Wrestler (silver medal winner) became a movie star (he was in many of Dr. Kildares, and would appear in four of Harlow's films.) Misstatement, plot twists , a young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in swimsuit at "Palm Beach", although the outdoor scenes of the center seem to be a backdrop.
