OK, here is my personal list of Nicktoons best shows like today: <br /> <br /> 1. All Grown Up / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenage robot <br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Notice a word with only capital letters? This means that this is Nick's show I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but great comedy animated on three rich cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who get into strange and really surreal situations, from trying to join Kimberely's slumber party for root beer to save a planet of snails from the evil spaceship. This is a Nick show that will simply tickle your funny bone sooner or later! The acronym is catchy and memorable. The actors of the voice - including Wayne Knight of the series "Seinfield" - bring the characters to new life with very bizarre personalities. The stories are fun (fan episodes would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor is all done in a certain style of Earthworm Jim. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, like "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which becomes very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
