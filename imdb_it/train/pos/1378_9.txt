I saw this little Belgian gem two days after seeing "American Teen". Make no mistake about it, adolescence is a roller coaster ride, be it American or European. 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or as it is called in the United States 'Water Lillies') is a story of a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes resembles a young Scarlett Johansson) recites the fresh, withdrawn part girl who wants to be on the school swim team, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane. Among them is Marie, a rather plump and unattractive friend, Anne, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age. Along the way, we are shown the usual series of pastimes for boys (broken hearts, lifting of shops, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). This is a quiet little movie that takes time to work in your system (Michael Bay fans, take note: the rhythm here is s-l-o-w, so stay away), but if you have no problems with this, Water Lillies is a charmer. No vote here, but it would bring down a strong "R", due to language, nudity, adult situations.
