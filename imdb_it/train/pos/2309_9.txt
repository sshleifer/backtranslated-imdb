It was life changing, it was REALLY !!! The Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience to watch. The acting was fabulous, the plot was fantastic, and this was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career. look how someone could not love this movie. Sure, it's not the best movie ever, even though it was close, but it was a lot of fun to watch, and I also had a great laugh at one of the jokes, and many other little laughs. cried, but this film was enlightening and brightens your day, even if you have to be a little depressed by the story from time to time. I can believe that this film has not won at least one award, and I can't even believe that it has been seen by so few people on this site. See this movie if you don't have it, it's definitely touching.
