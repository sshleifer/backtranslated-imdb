One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the Grimm brothers' crazy fable has become a stand-alone classic, thanks to some memorable tracks (including "A dream is a wish that your heart does "," Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo, "and the title song) and some nice comic relief. The famous shoe (click to enlarge image) We all know the story: the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters simply don't have it, this big Cinderella thinks she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince a suitable treasure, but perseverance, animal companions and a well organized entrance from a fairy godmother make sure things go well. There are some surprising sequences of pure animation - for example, Cinderella is reflected in the bubbles that wander in the air - and the design is rich and evocative. It's a simple story, stuffed here nicely with the comics business, in particular Cinderella's rodent friends (gaudily dressed like the dwarf helpers of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with an unfortunate cat named Lucifer .

It is a much simpler and more graceful work than the most frenetic animated films of today, which makes it both unique and rewarding.
