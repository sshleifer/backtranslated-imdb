I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main Cannes Festival building. <br /> <br /> I am passionate. I love the mix of fantastic invented scenes. It's an incredible set-design. The scenes really look like they were shot in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells of incredible Blues-men, with black and white scenes of an old man playing guitar and singing. It's really fantastic. But this also blends into new bands and this is perhaps something I might not like in this documentary. It's too abundant use of links with modern rock bands that play those Blues songs in a modern way. I didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such extraordinary Blues songs. This is the same kind of non-perfect musical taste that I found watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista's social club. <br /> <br /> The documentary was a standing ovation at this first screening in the small cinema, which the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and ordinary tourists on the Croisette beach in the open air cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor quality of the sound have probably made it a difficult experience for the thousands of people sitting on the sand that night.
