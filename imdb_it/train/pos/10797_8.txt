Composed, elegant Carol (wonderfully played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her nice husband Eddie (likeable David Houseman), the extravagant Carol, who constantly eats best friend Anna (delightfully tested with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan), and Anna Hunky, the loving husband Pete (a typical Eric Edwards) is a quartet of freed swingers who love to have frequent group relationships with one another. Their usual routine is interrupted when Carol's solitary, repressed but seductive mother, the widow Jennifer (a beautifully moving exhibition of the beautiful Jennifer Welles) lets herself go for a visit. Soon enough, Jennifer melts and becomes willing to take part in the carnal lifestyle of a cheerfully and uninhibited swinger, with everyone except Carol, eager to seduce her. The writer / director Joe Sarno elaborates an acute, compelling and perceptive examination of suburban anxiety and the limits of the entire wild sexual revolution of the 70s; Sarno transforms the traditional costumes of the bourgeoisie on their heads and further enriches things with a subplot of incest mother and daring and provocative daughter. In addition, Sarno gets a first-rate uniform acting from the cast: Welles and Brooke are both outstanding, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the biting New Age therapist Shandara and Erica Eaton as a neighbor on duty Mrs Campi Better yet, all women are extremely hot and seductive; In particular, Welles seriously wanders on the screen with his exquisitely voluptuous figure and his smoking erotic presence. The sex scenes are really sparkling and quite explicit, but never vulgar or boring. Stephen Colwell's brilliant and refined cinematography and Jack Justis' acoustic and melodic folk soundtrack are both valuable and effective. Recommended vision for Sarno fans.
