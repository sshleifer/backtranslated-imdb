"Capitães de Abril" is very good. History is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​what it was like. The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not ruin the film. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are not exaggerations and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25th revolution. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are beautifully interpreted. Lisbon is as beautiful as ever. Not to be missed! I really enjoyed this movie.
