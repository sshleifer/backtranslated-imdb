Example of a text book of an undervalued film. <br /> <br /> Although it is possible to watch this movie over and over and laugh every time and still see something new in it, it is still considered just another fun image. And although the film has inspired many and added quotes and images to the pyramid of all its spectators, Moon Over Parador has not yet received the approval it should. Even the brilliant cast with Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, Oscar winner, to name one, is not able to change this perception. <br /> <br /> But after seeing Raul Julia while Roberto Strausmann made an offer to Richard Dreyfus he can do. Rejecting yourself in a chicken coop by reading to him a good review of a part he once played can come to a conclusion: this stuff is timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof.
