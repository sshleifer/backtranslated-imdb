This film is one for the ages. First of all, I must say that after having seen it once, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has created a real piece of art. Where 99.9% of films these days is purely for entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The mainstream media turn and turn, but Ben Coccio looks at school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before, in the mind and heart of two young men who plan to kill their fellow class. While it is definitely graphic and horrible, how could it not be? The gloves come off, the lies and sugar coating of our media masters are swept away and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it's not just a loss of life as everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, they are more human, we are shown that these guys are us and us. Society has left them behind and the consequences are horrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your fellows. A lesson that we should all learn, thank you so much for making this film, Mr. Coccio, I hope with great expectation that you will continue your film career.
