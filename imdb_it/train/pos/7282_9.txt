This was a great film and it is absolutely unfair to judge him without considering the time he was released. There are some movies that don't age, but this is clearly obsolete. However, I saw this film when I was a boy and for more than twenty years both images like the story have been unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could enjoy it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this film as the topic of several chats and meetings where old kids were talking about things we have in common. So there was a little feeling of disappointment and even sadness when we finally got the DVD. First, there was a theory of how naive our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would be happy that this film has something that should be interesting for all modern filmmakers, especially those that focus on the decadent horror genre. This is mutilation, the idea that gives coherence to the film; the fact of a mutilated human being produces a horror deeper than death and torture. I remember how sick the feeling was when the monster tore off Kurt's arm. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere that prevails without intensity decay through all the scenes, no matter if the action is in a secret laboratory, a solitary road where the man in a car is looking for a female body, one striped dressing room, and so on. Perhaps the reasons why it is no longer a good movie are just technical things. For example, in the scene of the accident and the man who saves his girlfriend's head, a more accurate job, done for another director of the second modern unit, could be interesting. Same thing with all the action scenes, including that of Kurt's arm. Also, something could be done with the monster's makeup. Some remakes were good; I think in this case it's worth trying. However, black and white tones must be preserved.
