This show is a must see. He has the best cast of talent I've seen in a long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I guess the ABC executives aren't used too much, because it wasn't another reality show). However this show was believable with nice characters and wonderful narrative lines. Probably they are not in the age group that they expect to appreciate as the show, since they are among the forty, but also many of my friends liked it very much (late 30s - mid 40s) and are dying for shows of quality with talented cast members. I don't think this show has had enough time to win an audience. I think that given more time this show would work very well. Once again, the ABC is not giving a real chance to the real show. With so many shows given case after case and not worth it! They have to give quality shows a real chance and time to really click and get an audience. I loved the characters and can't wait to watch every episode. I followed the episodes on the ABC videos and the show continues to improve. Even if I think we still have an episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if you can save this show from extinction. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are only worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION AT ABC AT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
