David and Bathsheba is a sumptuous Hollywood Bible portrait produced by 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore ( Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second book of the Old Testament of Samuel taken from the Holy Bible. Follows King David, who had killed the giant Goliath as a child and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. A strong and confident king, David still has heart problems that cause big problems. For once he spies Bathsheba showering, but it is the beginning of a journey that includes adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgment of God being called. <br /> <br /> Typically for the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great and grandiose production. From its excellent scenery to its stunning technicolor photography {Leon Shamroy}, it has enough quality to justify the possibility of sitting next to the best that the genre has to offer regarding production values. However, atypically, the film has a fast pace and relies on the fact that 99% of its value is driven exclusively by dialogue. This is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. This is a very humanistic portrait, in fact it does not leave the burning bush in awe, it is a biblical love story stained with sins of the heart. But it's not bad at all, because by excommunication we find that it is very well interpreted {Peck has a stoic but vulnerable thing going very well and Hayward is pushing him to the max}, and it's a nice direct story with the skillful knowledge of the often forgotten Henry King. And although some dialogues are decidedly provocative, the flow of characters is never interrupted when the screenplay nominated for Phillip Dunne's Oscar (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) draws attention everywhere. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten image in terms of the Biblical / Spade and Sandal genres (most likely because it is a talking piece that has the heart as its main strength), but in reality it is worth the time of anyone interested in the most luxurious genres. 7/10
