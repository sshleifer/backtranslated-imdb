ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brazen braggart of a struggling Irish family who became the world heavyweight champion at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) toured claiming to "beat any alive man. " Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they have ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh directed the colorful story with robust style, capturing family life and warm scenes full of good humor. All Warner contract players constitute the refined cast - including the ever-reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's turbulent father, proud of his son's fighting abilities, and ALEXIS SMITH who takes full advantage of his role as a gritty company girl who enjoys taking Flynn a peg with the impertinent aleators who take care of his presumptuous ways. <br /> <br /> The whole atmosphere of the 1880s is captured in glorious B & W, although it is a pity Warners no longer trusted Flynn to make the film in color. He was entering a rocky phase of his film career at that time, engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all the tabloids busy fixing things. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are among the best choreographed forever on the screen, with Flynn obviously in very good shape and making very little use of double for most of the action. And the scene in which Bond gives Flynn his award plaque at a social gathering is one of Ward's best moments in a long career as an actor. <br /> <br /> In summary: It keeps the interest all the way, whether you are a sports fan or not.
