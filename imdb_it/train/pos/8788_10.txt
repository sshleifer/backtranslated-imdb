Well, I'm glad to hear a rumor that this can finally be released on DVD. When that happens, I don't know, but I'll take it when it's released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's funniest film, especially when "Gentleman Jim" Corbett's career in the ring begins in the film. Then switch from a good movie to a fantastic one. <br /> <br /> Few people could play arrogant men and come out as a good guy as Flynn could and this movie is a perfect example of this. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe that. You can only hear how much fun he had here. Even Ward Bond seems to have really enjoyed his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Even Bond has never been better. <br /> <br /> There is only the right amount of action boxing scenes here and they are also well done. Corbett's family is also fun to watch as they continue into the stands during Jim's games. Outside the arena, the constant discussions and screams of Corbett's family can get a little too loud and annoying, but they set the stage for a proper conclusion. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some critics with petty tones (Variety, for example) disliked that conclusion, nor the fact that much of the film is fictional, but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. And, in this case, he created a good story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very gentle gentleman, not something like the portrait of Flynn, but Flynn still makes him a good boy.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest classic films I have ever seen and I look forward to the DVD.
