Put yourself in Carla's shoes. She is a laborious overworked administrator, little appreciated, who is invisible. You know her: she has trained three of her last three leaders, she knows where all the bodies are buried and she could even look at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. Always having time for another thankless task and doing it better than most despite a severe disability, he has the desk on the way to the bathroom that becomes the repository of semi-finished coffee cups that ask to be poured. What? Don't you want to hear it? Well, she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place. Get ready to experience life from the point of view of hearing. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work does not lead anywhere; friends rely on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out is with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. He will not take a vacation - a contract is becoming critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla presents requirements that express her real needs: a "well-groomed" man. This brings a candidate to approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our desires. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) makes a mistake at the beginning of his job interview and his assumption clearly demonstrates Carla's interest in her non-work-related qualities. He sees the potential in this former thief and as the story develops, their relationship grows into a very unusual pattern of co-dependency. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition to return to the world outside prison walls and finds himself in another kind of prison: one of the variety of offices and another of contract servitude to pay an old man debt. His skills as a thief help Carla win a political battle in the office. But Paul sees a great opportunity with Carla's ability to read lips and drag her even further into a world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal film noir unclassified and probably suitable for older kids. Carla becomes more powerful, professionally and personally, as the story progresses and her disability offers her clear advantages to all of us. It grows like a woman who discovers her sensual side while using her resources to overcome obstacles in competing in a man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are made for each other, in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla will remain in his role as a doormat. He has our sympathy, our hopes and my best wishes even if he does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, from the clumsy adjustments of your hearing aid, the muffled sounds, almost imperceptible without you to see who is speaking to relatively distinct voices. With a great sense disabled, we see Carla's increased intuitive force to compensate. And we can all use this sense to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.
