Robot Jox tries hard, but basically it's a series of fighting scenes put together: robot versus robot, man against man, man against woman. The premise had potential, but it seems that the script was not really given the additional proofs it needed. Still, it was pretty good, for a science fiction action movie. Partly because the script was by Joe Haldeman. For those unfamiliar with the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War". He is considered one of the best novels for battle armor, right there with "Starship Troopers" by Robert Heinlein and "Armor" by John Steakley. And this film is much more like a giant battle armor film than a giant robot. It's closer to what the fans would have liked instead of Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers" disguise, which had only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, this is actually not based on Homer's Iliad. A couple of names are all they had in common. Achilles with the foot of his blown robot had no parallels in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. Nor was the ancient Achilles a noble warrior. He was the strongest, but also vindictive and petty. Even the jock robot killed in the first scene is no good. He was named Hercules, while the Greek Iliad would have had Heracles. <br /> <br /> The effects were quite good for time and budget. True, it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but that movie cost ten times as much. The stop motion was almost as good as the walkers robots of "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". Better, in fact, than a lot of animation by Ray Harryhausen, which is much appreciated, but rather dated. <br /> <br /> Don't add high expectations to this and you probably won't be disappointed. It's better than a lot of other low-budget movies and even some big-budget blockbuster hits that have better effects but far worse scripts.
