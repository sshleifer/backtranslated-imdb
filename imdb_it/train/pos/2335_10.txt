This is what t.v. it should be. And Pushing Daisies lives up to these expectations. A beautifully crafted and beautifully designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few prime-time shows that has integrity, is good for the whole family and lights up your imagination. This is not the normal action, sex, money or murder angles of any other show on t.v. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are real for all of us. Want something you can't have, hoping that someone wants us, running away from your past and looking for the family, even in the most unlikely places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I realize that the ABC has practically canceled this wonderful show at this point, and most likely will replace it with some show beyond the point of integrity. I suppose everything comes back in cash ... it's a shame that there are now no other shows on ABC that will make you feel good after seeing them.
