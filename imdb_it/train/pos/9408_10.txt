Often labeled as a comedy, The Man In The White Suit poses much more than a little laugh here and there. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who does not have the chance to make his world flourish because nobody points out, he is simply the odd man of the odd ball on the spot so to speak. After bluffing his way into Birnley's spinning mill, he uses their lab to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out, but doesn't even need to be cleaned! At the beginning he was proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him, but then the omens of a vanishing industry raise their heads and the consensus quickly turns into something much more frightening. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is very funny, in fact some scenes are damn funny, but it is the satirical aspect of the film that elevates it above the ordinary for me. The contradictions about the advent of technology are a crucial issue, we want inventions that save us fortunes while we shut down industries, you just have to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain to know what I'm talking about. The decade in which the film was made is a crucial point to note, the creation of nuclear weapons has become something more than mere rumors, science was advancing at frighteningly new proportions. Watch this movie and see the rapid reversal of events for the main protagonist Stanley, from the hero to the enemy in one fell swoop, victim of his own quest to improve humanity !, it's so dark that the film should have been called The Man In The black dress. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't find anything wrong with this movie, the script by Roger MacDougall, John Dighton and director Alex Mackendrick could be shot today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and the thought of mind that has. The sound and the setting are enormous, the direction is fluid, with the tonal passage managed by Mackendrick. Some scenes are simply wonderful, one in particular picks up the strings of the heart and leads one to think of a certain scene in Elephant Man by David Lynch some 29 years later, yet after such a crisis of events the film still manages to take a wink like the genius of Alec Guinness to close the film to keep viewers thinking not only about Stanley's future, but also about the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world. <br /> <br /> A timeless masterpiece, thematically and like a work of art, 10/10.
