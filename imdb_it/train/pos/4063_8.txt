Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film. After seeing it for the first time I am happy to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you get the value of your time, which means (as far as Miyazaki's films are concerned), which is nothing less than excellent! <br /> <br /> Produced at the beginning of his film career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the brands in his later films, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow due to external circumstances, helped by very interesting (and sometimes adorable) supporting characters. And, of course, the usual battle of nature against civilization, flying machines (lots of them !!), splendid painted scenarios ?? but alas, no pigs (at least the one I noticed, after all I only saw it once). Nevertheless, Miyazaki had already had his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausic√£a, which was a rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is a bit of a part of these two, with a soft action full of the first 30 minutes, similar to his TV series Conan, and his direct episodes of Meitantei Holmes. Here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy who works in a small country mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is ready to help her discover where she comes from, while she escapes from the army and a band of air pirates. As the film progresses, the plot becomes heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, when Castle in the sky was first produced), and very similar to its director, Joe Hisaishi, the composer starts with a very light score , which becomes more complex and beautiful as the plot goes on! <br /> <br /> A note for the English dubbing, with a good interpretation of the two star stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very strong accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a head to Mark Hamil in the role of Muska, making up for a wicked and devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this people!
