The Korean War has been dubbed the forgotten war of the Americas. So many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50,000 men who died there. Occasionally, we are treated to a theatrical or cinematographic representation dealing with that distant, ghostly frozen cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker". The story is of an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) who is selected for a top secret mission by his commander. His job is to desert the North Koreans and offer his services against UN forces. Its coverage is so effective, it proves invaluable to the enemy and has the rank of major. However, he is later captured by the Americans, put on trial as a traitor and a spy. Stating that he was ordered to desert, he sadly learns that his commanding officer was killed and has no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He is condemned and sentenced to hanging. However, his conviction is questioned by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his public prosecutor. Convinced commander of General Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial and, if found guilty, he will be put to death. The court drama is top notch, like the cast that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a distant place, but the possibility of condemning a communist and hanging him struck very close to home in the 1950s. Thanks to his superior script and his powerful message, this drama has become a courtroom classic. Excellent vision and recommended for everyone. ****
