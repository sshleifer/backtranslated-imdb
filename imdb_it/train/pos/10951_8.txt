Big S is not playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, for example, Mencia or Chapelle (although I like both). You state the obvious in subtle and almost subliminal observations. His show will not change the world, nor is it intended to. But, along with the eccentric Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show" fame, this is a mediocre show with an appetite for destruction! My part was completely destroyed by the first episode. Listen, I love this woman and like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she only offers lines and lets the viewer run. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and everyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, when she sings with fake birds to quickly comment on society and the absurd nonsense from the university age. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost it in their most recent lipo-suction or boob job).
