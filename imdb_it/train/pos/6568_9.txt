I liked this film as a child when it came out, and they still do it today. A simple story that involves the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally out of a history of paperback books. He has actors who were more recognizable during the day. This should not prevent the viewer from giving him a vortex. Wayne Crawford plays the main character Jake Speed. Of course, it could bite some elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar. I'm surprised too many people don't know. It must have been overshadowed by other films in theaters in '86. I saw it on cable TV. It may be difficult to find as it is out of print on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get an ebay DVD for less than $ 8! Fluke.
