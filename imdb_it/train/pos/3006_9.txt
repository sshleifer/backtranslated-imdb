While a 9 might seem an unusually high soundtrack for such a small film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series of 1930s and 1940s crime films, this is among the best and compares very favorably with the later ones "Thin "by Powell Man" movie. Now, this does NOT mean that the film is similar to the Thin Man movies, since THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but rather a traditional yellow and yellow movie. or Auction or a traditional comic helper (something that is found in practically all mass-produced crime films) would be damaging, but I didn't miss them at all because it was so exceptionally well-written film - with a genuinely interesting case and uniformly excellent performances by all. <br /> <br /> The film starts at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although this Philo Vance film actually spends most of the time at the dog show and the dogs do not they are a super-important part of the film. Instead, a completely hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room - an idea repeated in many other detective films (such as the STRANGEEST CASE OF CRIME). However, the way this is explained seems quite credible and combines very well, keeping my interest everywhere. Of course, I would like other crime films of the day to have intelligently written plots and exceptional acting like this. This is definitely a goalkeeper.
