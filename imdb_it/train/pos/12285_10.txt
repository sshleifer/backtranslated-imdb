Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made the relatives of the Chilean president Salvador Allende famous. In the environment of a large estate born of ruins, becoming a force of abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the Esteban Trueba parvenu and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, that at the moment it would be the process that leads to the greatest infamy of its history for the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would be Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: to remember, for example, that image of the senator with dark glasses they wink at the general to start building the palace). <br /> <br /> Bille August participates in an exceptional cast in the Jeremy that sticks out Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always leads us to force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes with these words: "The things that freckles are the same punishment you will need". <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Glenn Close playing a cue, Stephen's contaminated sister, whose sin, driven by loneliness, by spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep is also brilliant, a woman whose name came to mind as a Clara glove. With telekinetic, cognitive and mediumistic powers, this hardened woman, faithful to her sincere and conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we desire for ourselves and for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (like the tender rebel leader of the unhappy Blanca Pedro Segundo ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard son of the senator, who acts as tool for returning the boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film moves the bowels, we have recreated some facts that should never be repeated, but that still happen absurdly (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and only immortalize Bille August.
