A melodrama remembered with affection ?? thanks especially to the beautiful performance of Ronald Colman's Oscar? on a theme often dealt with: the nature of acting and the way in which it can overcome the perception of reality. In this case, do we have a well-known actor who faces Shakespeare's "Othello" so that the last third of the film effectively penetrates the thriller genre? with press agent Edmond O'Brien (who seems to be really in love with the co-star and former wife of Colman, Signe Hasso), "investigating" the possible involvement of the actor in the strange strangled Desdemona of a maid in search of celebrities (a very thin Shelley) Winters). The theatrical / New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war period is vividly captured by the team of writers husband and wife of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and by the legendary "director of the actor" George Cukor (all recognized by the Academy with nominations); Incidentally, the film won a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic soundtrack. Colman, forever the gentle leader also blessed with a velvety voice, does Shakespeare quite well ?? gaining conviction, the more his character slips into an obsessive jealousy, a murderous rage and, finally, a paranoia; however, he is not disappointed by a supporting cast that also includes director Ray Collins, journalist Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the central section is a bit tense, the film compensates for all the shortcomings with a well-managed expressionist epilogue.
