I've always loved this great baseball movie! He has a good cast including two extraordinary actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Even Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has great special effects and acting of all the actors in the film! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits the film very well! Some of the actors who reminded me of the real baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's character of Ray Mitchell recalled Me Royce Clayton, the character of McConaughey reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders commentator in My Opinion Resembled How Al Hrabosky Appears Today. This is a fantastic movie for non-baseball fans and I highly recommend this movie!
