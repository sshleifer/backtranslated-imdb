This is an incredible anthology of Amicus horror, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances!, Only the last story disappoints. All the characters are fantastic, and the film is quite chilling and full of suspense, besides Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee they are simply fantastic in this one! He is very underrated and my favorite story has to be the third "Sweets To The Sweet", plus all the characters are very nice. Some of these are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland, but the ending was really good! This is an incredible anthology of Amicus horror, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story disappoints!, I say it's a must see! <br /> <br /> 1st Story ("Method for Murder"). This is a fantastic story, with a lot of suspense, and the killer Dominic is really creepy, and it's very well acted! This was the perfect way to start with a story, and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus the double ending is shocking and rather terrifying! Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ("Waxworks"). This is a solid story all around, with wonderful performances, yet the ending is quite predictable, but it's still scary, and has a bit of suspense, Peter Cushing did an incredible job, and I couldn't believe how young Joss Ackland it was, I really liked this story! Grade B <br /> <br /> 3rd story ("Sweets with dessert"). This is the best story here, because it is extremely scary and unpredictable, but it also has a nice twist! Christopher Lee did an incredible job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as the young daughter, plus the ending is pretty shocking! I don't want to ruin it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("The mantle"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and not very formal. Jon Pertwee bothered me, but the ending surprised me a bit, and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, but it's just boring, and it's been done before many times besides where there was creativity ??. Grade D <br /> <br /> The Direction is great! Peter Duffell does a great job here, with fantastic photographic work, great angles, adding an eerie atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> The Acting is fantastic! John Bryans is great here, like the narrator, he had some big lines, I just wanted to have more time on the screen. John Bennett is as good as Det., And he was pretty intense, he was particularly good at the end!, I liked him a lot. Denholm Elliott is excellent as Charles, he was vulnerable, he showed fear, he was very nice, and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is extraordinarily beautiful!, And did great things with what she had to do as a wife, she also had a great feeling with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly creepy as Dominic, he was creepy and he did the job very well! Peter Cushing is amazing as always, and he's fantastic here, he's nice, focused, charming and, as always, had a lot of class! (Cushing Rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as always, and he looked so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so thick, and he played a different role I loved it! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris is disturbing here, and he did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is amazing as always and he's fantastic here, he's incredibly intense, very focused, and as always he had that great intense look on his face, it was particularly surprising in the end! (Lee rules !!). Chloe Franks is as adorable as her daughter, she's pretty scary and gave one of the best children's shows I've ever seen!, I loved her. New York Dawn Porter is beautiful and she was excellent as the babysitter, I loved her fights! Jon Pertwee bothered me here, and he was rather dull, and totally inappropriate, he also had no problems with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and does her usual vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is fine. Overall it's a must see! **** out of 5
