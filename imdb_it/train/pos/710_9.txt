Although I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to abandon little Jesse, and it's something I never would have done, they were trying to do what was best for the child. The way this film is written, you see yourself wrapped in the story and wondering what you really believe, from all the different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unknown, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie, it really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least, that there is something really wrong with her. His character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The film seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unresolved. But apart from that, this movie is really cool. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to relax and relax and watch something nice that will make you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your beliefs, see things from the perspectives of others and find out something about you. Warning: you could even grow up while watching this movie! And it's worth it in the end.
