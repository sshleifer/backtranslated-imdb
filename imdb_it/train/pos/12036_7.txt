Why am I so convinced that there is actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere? I saw the movie again this year while I am teaching the novel and I find the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the child in the novel and the ending has been changed. They kill him in the film, but the point is that he is obsessed with the events of Eel Marsh House for many years, but remarries and eventually puts the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the movie where Kipps sets the office on fire is simply silly, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier signifying the child's presence is genuinely disturbing but meaningless - Kipps he is haunted by the woman who seeks revenge, not the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier. I only imagined it?
