This film lets the intellectual mind think and tries to analyze the story. I also can't understand why people would ruin this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie may not be suitable for you. <br /> <br /> This film has a high degree of realism. The performance of the actors and actresses is exemplary. Not fake, simply natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera work is excellent, the music is really good. I can't wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Leave your body numb, like Constant Garderner. The direct has raw talent, certainly not a follower.
