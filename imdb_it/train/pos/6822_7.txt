"Opening Night", published in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It happens only in the extraordinary performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of theater actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. It is self-absorbed, often hateful, and makes life miserable to those around it - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the verge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined, even if we are soon informed of the secret. Rowlands is obviously very lovingly directed by her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also has a role in the film. This film is not without flaws - it's too long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk it seems almost cruel. Improvisation in some dialogues, at least on stage, lasts too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, an interpreter of the squalid producer of Myrtle. The character of Joan Blondell has never been fully developed, and I've never been able to understand why it was in the movie, except to appease Myrtle. Watch this movie only for Rowlands - it's fascinating for everything - and it's hard to take your eyes off it, even if you want to.
