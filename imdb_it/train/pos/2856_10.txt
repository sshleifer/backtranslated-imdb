This is one of the movies that gets better every time you see them. It is full of so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in Sabu's subsequent films (I have not yet seen "Ape unlucky", but the others are just as big) failure, randomness and humanism play an important role. Cutting and editing are inventive and artistic, without the film being an "artistic" image, but extremely fun. When you compare it to "Run, Lola, Run" you have to remember that "Dangan Ranna" was created a few years earlier and was shown on German TV in 1997 ... so it is more likely to have served as an inspiration for Il film di Tom Tykwer, and not the other way around. Complementing the other reviews I must add that I really like acting and ending. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
