I don't really like both Shrek movies. (Since both "PGs" and have words in them I would never say myself, so I didn't like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", which I have barely barely seen for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films besides Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his hearing. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance, and moves towards it. This action eventually leads to his capture and many other things. Throughout the film, we listen to a narrative. It is through the thoughts of the Spirit, even if the horses never speak. This is what makes the film so sticky. They (the filmmakers) played real horses to make the sounds made by horses; none of these sounds was created by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare and Little Creek, Native American, owner of Rain. Shortly after Little Creek frees Spirit and Rain, they go to run home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack of this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't regret it. My score: 10/10
