Eight simple rules started as a very fun series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. I have always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget was done before, Kerry is quite unique and I can relate to her in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction in which her character went in the later series. <br /> <br /> The first episodes were fun, good teenage plots about Paul and Cate governing children, however I think the show lost its spark when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for wanting to continue the series, but when he died, I heard the program do it. For me the whole point of the show was based on the "8 simple rules of going out with my teenage daughter" guide written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and angle of the show had changed without Hennessey's father . <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to be more annoying, Rory had remained the same and Cate always gave her life lessons from offspring that previously seemed more fun when it was all left to Paul. I think grandpa is fun (especially when he's watching Great escape), but he thinks C.J isn't necessary for the show. It's funny in part, but I heard that the narrative lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. Among all the newer ones is not bad just missing excitement and someone else finds it irritating that Cate works at school and C.J and grandpa is always there too? I always recommend this show to friends because at the beginning it was very strong and it was worth looking at Paul and Kerry, but later ones were at most average.
