I know a lot of people don't like this movie, but I think it's adorable. There is not much I can say, but the film is a film that seems good to me. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are a lot of funny lines in the film, especially when Briggitta learns to know the things to do and those not of the company. If you like musicals, I'd say you'd like that!
