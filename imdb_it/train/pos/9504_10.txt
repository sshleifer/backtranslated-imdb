As many know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema, fortunately, during the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, great films like La Ley de Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También and, of course, El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba, appeared. El Coronel ..., is a wonderful film, which tells the classic story of Gabriel García Márquez, eliminating the elements of magical realism and replacing them with the harsh reality experienced in Mexico, not only by people like the Colonel, who are waiting for their pensions , but by more than half of the Mexican population, living in complete poverty. The characters in the film satirically represent classic characters found in Mexican society, such as the nationalist colonel, the cold and even ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time a faithful compadre, a tolerant and patient wife, a hidden homosexual, etc. film, it's a must see if you want to learn more about Mexican society, and especially, if you want to see a wonderful film, from one of the best Mexican directors
