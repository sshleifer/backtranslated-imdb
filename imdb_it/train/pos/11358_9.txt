The poor quality of the DVD video is the only reason I gave this film a 9 instead of a 10. This could have been much better, this film deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is really a film that covers several themes simultaneously. If you don't like serial killer movies, but you're fascinated by the amazing bureaucratic culture in the former Soviet Union, this film is a must see. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to "Silence degli Agnelli" for several reasons. The way the serial killer is depicted has been done much better in Citizen X. See many details of his private life, because you "travel" with the killer, which gives you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration . <br /> <br /> The only other film I've seen is as realistic as this "Henry - portrait of a serial killer". If you are fascinated by that movie, you absolutely have to take a look at Citizen X.
