Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning biographical film Patton, follows him with a strong tribute to another of the American fighter generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of man, his genius and his selfishness. With MacArthur one never knew where one began and the other stopped and too often mixed. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour movie or a television miniseries. He would have covered him from his days in border posts with his family to West Point, where he still has the highest school average ever achieved by a cadet. He would talk about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend that builds courage on the battlefields of the First World War in France. He should also say that he shot the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on every chance President Herbert Hoover was re-elected. During the last years of MacArthur, he and Hoover made penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. It must have been a subject they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years 1941 to 1952 and is told in flashbacks. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes back to the Second World War and his desperate struggle against the Japanese advancing on Corregidor Island and in the Bataan camps on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to regain the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief from President Truman's command. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a film would not work at all if it was not for the portraits of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the film that I enjoyed the best, seeing MacArthur and his relationships with both of these men. <br /> <br /> FDR by O'Herlihy captures the squire aristocrat and the exceptionally devious man who was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who managed to get his points with unusual subtlety and intelligence. Sometimes he liked to intrigue a little too much for himself, but he was the political master of the last century. Notice how he behaves with MacArthur as both a battlefield commander and a potential rival at the same time. Truman by Flanders is how people remember him, a frank man of people who did not appreciate the haughtiness of MacArthur from gitgo. Of course it is in the history books as Truman raised MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was unruly, no doubt. <br /> <br /> However, I could write a whole thesis on Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way it was never due to a crisis. I always thought that FDR would have dealt with the whole issue in a much better way if he had been president then. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also eloquent and Gregory Peck captured some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as legendary as the victories on the battlefield. He listens to Peck's Japanese surrender, MacArthur's dismissal to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree.
