BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is an off-the-wall film starring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Two slacker friends play, creating a sport in their driveway that becomes a national sensation. Most gags are really hilarious, but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "scorn" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so of course they do the craziest things possible. A flaw in this film is that the pace is too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking "Wow, is this already over?" Another hilarious part of the film was the way Joe and Doug continually harassed Squeak, who is an exasperated kid. BASEketball is a comic classic with some very quotable lines and is very fun to watch!
