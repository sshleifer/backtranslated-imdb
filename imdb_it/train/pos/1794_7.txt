In the middle of the "Evening" of Lajos Koltai, a woman on her deathbed asks a figure who appears in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line may be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman who speaks is Vanessa Redgrave, delivering it with extreme simplicity, and the question tears your heart out. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the film based on Susan Minot's novelty skirts sentimentality and ordinariness, attracts attention, offers admirable performance and generates emotional involvement as few recent films have. With only six months a year, now there are two memorable, meaningful, worthy films in theaters, the other, of course, is "Away from Her" by Sara Polley. Hollywood may have turned "Evening" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of mothers and daughters of real life - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is Redgrave's daughter in the film (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays the younger role of Streep, while Redgrave's young incarnation is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a large cast - yes, he could have turned into a multiple star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian director of photography of "Mephisto" and the director of "Fateless" - has created a subtle ensemble with a "continental touch", the story that takes place in a Newport environment of high society, in the days before a marriage that is full of problems. <br /> <br /> Connections lost, wrong choices and due respect for social and family pressures present rather a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, Koltai's direction and the "Serata" altruistic recitation well above that level, in the rarefied air of the English, French (and few American) family sagas of a century before its contemporary setting. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, come across in a clear, understandable, engaging way. Single melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> Yet, with all the previous emphasis on ensemble and altruistic performances, "Evening" stars continue to shine, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (a new exciting discovery, which vaguely resembles his mother but a very different actress), Danes who carries most of the load - until Streep shows up in the last few moments and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> As for "Away from Her", "Evening" stays with you for a long time, inviting you to rethink its story and its characters, and experiencing the emotions it raises. At two hours, the movie runs a bit long, but the way it will stay with you on is welcome among the many films that become cold long before your popcorn.
