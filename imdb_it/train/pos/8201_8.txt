Suddenly Impact tends to be considered Eastwood's artistic failure at a time in his career, when he established a good reputation as a director. The reason is not really the film itself, but the attitude it takes towards the vigilantism that it seems to support. In some places, it actually owes much more to the desire for death than to Dirty Harry's original film. It could be objected if this is so, in the end it is a film about guilt, justice and punishment. For me, at the end of the day it is more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments, it can easily be overlooked that the sudden impact is a terribly well made film. Forget the "Go ahead punk, make my day scene", which is iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Francisco taken from the sky, magnifying the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or take a look at the brilliantly done scene in which the character of Sondra Locke visits her mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So all in all, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood put on the screen, even if in an action movie of a questionable ideology. Also, I think this is the first film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The narrative space brings visual elements to be well integrated into the film and not to distract from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog fart.
