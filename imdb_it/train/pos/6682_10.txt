I saw it in theaters and I absolutely love it. Geoffery Rush gave the best interpretation of a super villain I've ever seen since Gene Hackman was Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a damsel in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was as fantastic as the Blue Raja, and I particularly liked the fact that the character wasn't really English. The scene with him and his mom who was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest things were about Stiller and his character's false anger, Mr. Furious, and the fact that his threats and jokes were incomprehensible and that they never made any sense. I barely managed to stop myself from applauding when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss," it was said. But one of the things I liked the most is that Captain Amazing really dies in the movie. I highly recommend this movie for every occasion, and I give it my personal thumb up.
