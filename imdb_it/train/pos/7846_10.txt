I'm usually not too interested in a specific show (except for The OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But, no kidding, after an episode of Reunion I was captured. <br /> <br /> I can't even say how tired I was of the fact that last night was in conflict with Bush's speech last night because I was looking forward to the 1987 episode, which will air next Thursday. Once again, this conflict was disadvantageous because, being a new show, it needs to build a sequel and having the second episode rejected a week kills some momentum. <br /> <br /> That said, TV doesn't always have to be Emmy worthy of being nice. I don't expect Reunion to bring home any prizes, but I expect it will be able to catch my attention throughout the season. Have you ever watched the first episodes of a show loved years later? Sometimes you wonder how you ever fell in love. Character building takes some time. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​an episode for each year is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show I can remember doing something like this is 24, with every one-hour episode ... and having an eventful year is more realistic than an eventful day! Please give this show a shot. Relax on the art form ... it's just the TV!
