What a loss was the death of director Emile Ardolino! He could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put in a sparkle and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky like great novels, but it's definitely the one that keeps you tuned to the end. You really want to know how things will go. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on his "Moonlighting" success for the new generation that was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big-screen movies he had a very promising start after. In this film she is back in shape as a still vigorous widow who lives through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson at the height of celebrity who will culminate with "Fried Green Tomatoes" two years later). She may have seemed too young for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. This is his film, but it does not go beyond its limits as a protagonist. <br /> <br /> SHepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr. to bring much of the film and shows a more mature comic touch than he had in his film prior to that point. And there's ample support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role over the years) and Christopher MacDonald. The natural charm of Masterson practically costs on its own, or that or she has a way of making her character look like a breath of fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of the sex appeal of his cast the same way he did with "Dirty Dancing", but this film is not so fizzy, so you could still see it with your parents if they were in the room . (Use your best judgment, after all they are your parents.) Giving this movie a high score because it is very user friendly, romantic comedy fans will find it sublime, and those who are just looking at them should find a lot of even humor is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Once again, the credit goes to Emile Ardolino for making the most of the fascinating script by Randy and Perry Howze. (Where am I now?) Ardolino's next film would be the sequel to "Three Men and A Baby", but his last theatrical release (Sister Act) would finally give him the highly successful nine-digit hit he deserved. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch is missing!
