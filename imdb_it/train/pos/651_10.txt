** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I have no problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of me at 20, but that's even better. As Veronica says, two chicks at a time. It brings out the irritation, the casual conversation, these two chicks of real life, rather than prostitutes, who excite us every step of the way. I also go to conversations. Even if I am absolutely b.s. sometimes, so what? Every girl, almost, with whom I have ever spoken and who has a high level of self, is usually full of the same unreasoning wandering self-centered. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and as sensible as that other b. philosophy chicks are often in: astrological charts. The only agreement with this film is that the boy is almost as feminine as the women, he is in the same b.s. and mood. The brunette girl is actually the most masculine person there. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit strange that the dark girl is so clearly turned on by Veronica. She would like to snatch Alexander the little blonde, but Veronica plays it to the end. It's brilliant. He gets the brunette thinking that there is something between them, and then he steals the child / man, which is only appropriate because they seem to be of the same age. The brunette knows she was captured at the end, when she put her face in the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that, to paraphrase, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain. /> <br /> Do they eventually get married, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship that ends in a pre-marriage breakup. They are too selfish to be something against each other compared to trampolines. <br /> <br /> But I like the film. He entertained me, looks good and is sexy.
