This film was recommended to me by a friend. I never saw an ad or a trailer, so I didn't know Clooney was there and wasn't bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole cast was suitable, and I found the film rather pleasant, all things considered. The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing at the edge of the road, with a whipped and distorted air, immediately caught my attention. He had a way of telling you, "don't go away, this won't be boring", and in reality it wasn't. It turned out to be an interesting, light comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your place until the end, but when the ending came, I felt a little cheated .... just a little. Events continued to grow, so that you expected them to continue building, but to a point that I cannot define, it is a sort of leveling, making the final a slight disappointment. I think I would have expected a bigger bang than a climax, but it turned out to be a bit of a low-key. If you watch the movie with this in mind and can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this movie very fun and worth watching. Now I'd like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rarity in the United States.
