I have personally seen many Disney movies throughout my life, although none of them have ever had access to Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally wouldn't have encountered live-action with the animation, it was an improvement in trying to dress people as characters in the animation. The film shows three displaced people from the Second World War who are sent to stay with a silent and socially embarrassing woman in the country. I have to say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great love interest for entertainers. The endings always surprise me and this was no exception. He was neither happy nor sad, though I don't know if it was intentional. The dialogue was not exceptional, but considering that it was designed to be a film for children, that's fine. Overall, I would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialogue six out of ten, the cast nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten.
