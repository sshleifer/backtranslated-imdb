Easily the greatest low budget horror of all time. I saw this film for the first time when I was about 9 years old and I have to say that it scared me to death. Now that I have grown up, however, I see this film for what it really is ... a brilliant work. Everyone, or at least everyone with some taste, dreamed of seeing a snowman go around killing people, even if they won't admit it. I've always found something really scary in snowmen, so naturally, for a horror junkie like me, this movie was a dream come true. Some say this movie is silly, or anyway lacking in intelligence ... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who has given this film a low score is obviously too tense to sit down and have a good laugh with stupid jokes and cool blood. I love this film for what it is, a comedy, and as long as the film industry is not wise and makes a serious horror film about a killer snowman (which seems unfortunately impossible) I will keep this great piece of horror indie close heart.
