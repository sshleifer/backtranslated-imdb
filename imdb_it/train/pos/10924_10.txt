I saw this Kung Fu movie when I was a child, and I thought it was so beautiful! Now I'm 26, and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We have a beer case and saw this classic! He lost NO of his original Kung Fu freshness! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... DVD is available. I think this movie is also called "Choose your poison". <br /> <br /> Look soon!
