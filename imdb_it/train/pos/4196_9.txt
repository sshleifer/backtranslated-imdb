This crime thriller is a bit like a film noir, even if it changes the post-war context to the cold war and has something relatively dignified to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", the cops are good guys, the criminals are genuine men and the only enemies are "The Commies", which in the end are differentiated from the good guys because they are emotionally affable, guided by real attention to their value, as shown in the constantly drawn up plans that speckle the film. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around the characters. The personalities of this film are quite unique and detailed: skip the purse that is able to put aside any danger and, sometimes, while going through their personal assets; Look at the informant who is trying to save for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and the public); Candy, the innocent girl who only thinks she is doing government work and does not fully understand the conspiracy with which she is involved; and Joey, the former bad boyfriend Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person in it. Throw in a lot of very colorful support characters (like the guy with the wands and the cops) and "Pickup on South Street" is a shining personality as they hunt the frames of mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilms. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
