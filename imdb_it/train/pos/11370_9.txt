Spoiler - as I describe the characters and their relationship with the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality film. The subject is at once gloomy and compelling. The ruthless determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With due excuses to him, his retriever, an expression constantly put to service, serves the character well. It is, as in England, I would say about the character of Inspector Taggart's TV series, destined to be gloomy because he sees three murders a week. Well, this is not as accurate as Chikatila operated for a number of years ... <br /> <br /> You have a real sense of the resistance of the white wall of the USSR bureaucracy, brilliantly played by Joss Ackland (who often seems made for this kind of role). <br /> <br /> A key character (and I write it while the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is shown on BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support from Burakov is constant. And it lasts through Perestroika, and drives the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for me.
