I love the broomsticks and the broomsticks so much that I cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it. I would also like to reiterate the simple fact that I love him so much. Too much someone said. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all the same way. I also love anyone else who loves it. I love you. my favorite scene is the dance scene at Portobello Road. I learned the dance moves and practiced it every day. I have some audio recordings of myself singing the song. if anyone can play the drums or the guitar, I'm thinking of forming a bed band and a broom band. I hope to call it "the knobs". love me (liz)
