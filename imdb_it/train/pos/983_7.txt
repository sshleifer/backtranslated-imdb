I think this film has a lot to recommend it, especially a particularly sinister performance by David Morse and a more than passable performance, which has always been worth watching Mr. Foxx. Although there are many holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, all in all, it's a nice moment in front of the tube.
