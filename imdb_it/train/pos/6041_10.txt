This is one to look at a couple of times. The excellent writing shows that they must have lived this story or known someone who did it because they nailed it. Freebird revived me and laughed at my sparse youth. The title was a great choice. Great film, setting, history, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker movie, but it would be a shame to frame it that way. Funny to the bone, a bit like Trailer Park Boys in the United States. If you've never seen TPB, try to figure out if you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Following? It could be done. There is much more to the world than I would like to see through their eyes.
