"Home Room" like "Zero Day" and "Elephant", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shootout. Making it less exploitable and more useful because little is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Don't give up this little movie during the first 20 minutes, the real story is supposed to, but it sounds like a "Hill Street Blues" episode refused. It's lame, but bear it, at least it's long enough to allow the film to be classified as a feature. I recommend skipping all this and skipping the hospital scenes: there is nothing that cannot be gathered from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Like many good films, this was a creative one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. Although this agreement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it would mean a certain construction and execution unit that often lacks great dramatic features. Because the screenplay for "Home Room" is its true strength, it is fortunate that the writer also performed the production and ensured that his vision came to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan has an enormous opportunity with the finale that tests the limits of tolerance to the sentimentality of the average spectator. He runs it to the limit, but against all logic he lets you cry instead of cringing. Because the ending works is a combination of the public's need for a reward at the end of this type of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin "Sweet Surrender") coming out, and the amazing editing of the final minute. <Br /> <br /> The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips interprets his standard alienated surly teen and Christensen his clever daughter of a good family, both bring more intensity to their roles than ever. The family life of both girls is more than satisfying and of little interest to Ryan. What's happening here is all about the two of them, despite a broken story of a police detective wondering around the city trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever cut out and cut out the film, this story should be condensed. <br /> <br /> A story about two extremely different girls coming together and helping each other is certainly not a new idea and Ryan could easily have driven this film in clich√© and predictability. But instead his script involved them in a fascinating and convincing sparring match, slowly crunching with each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to withdraw into them. Deanna's line "I'm dying inside" makes you cry apart - I can't think of a moment in any other movie I've felt so intensely like that. He desperately needs a connection that Alicia desperately rejects. Deanna makes progress only when she retires. The spectator continues to expect a group embrace that never seems to happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but lets you admire both the characters and the two actresses who brought them to life. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
