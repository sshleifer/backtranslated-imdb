With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully demonstrates that years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by simply touching it. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction film during the second post-war period. Director Hillyer used some permanent sets from the "FLASH GORDON" series that was filmed simultaneously and also included some footage of Frankenstein's electric cars. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects used in this great classic film. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best and both enjoyed working together and will be appreciated by future generations.
