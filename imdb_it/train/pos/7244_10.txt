This is the only feature film on the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the film is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how to make a living. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I don't think a non-bridge player can get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the clothes are really beautiful, too bad the film is in black and white - I can only imagine how they would be in color. The way the media is portrayed is absolutely fun. There is no way the bridge will ever be like this. <br /> <br /> Watch it as soon as possible, and tell your friends.
