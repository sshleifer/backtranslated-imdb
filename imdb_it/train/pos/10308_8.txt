Well, was Morgan Freeman more unusual than the God of George Burns? This film was definitely better than that, "Oh, God." I was totally engrossed and LMAO to the end. Carrey was perfect for the aspiring anchorman, and Aniston completed her role as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual performance. I, for example, do not consider it neither ugly nor lacking in talent. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the binder thinking he could never keep his life story. See if you can locate the file in the cabinet that contains the events of his bathroom humor: I was reversing this. Well written and even better interpreted, this comedy will turn into one of the best of this funnyman.
