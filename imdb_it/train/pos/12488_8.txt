I'm not fussy at all in horror movies, and I'm willing to watch virtually none of them. This does not mean that I am willing to review many of them, or that I will have no criticism for them. This film is creepy and is very well done. In fact, I think this movie would have made an excellent double-bill with session 9. <br /> <br /> I should specify, before coming to my comments, that I saw it alone. I started watching it before going to bed and I arrived about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective, so I saved the rest for the morning. Even while watching him in broad daylight, he was still creepy. However, I cannot guarantee how effective it would be when looking at a larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, a couple moves into a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death. Allow me to take note of this death: this is one of the rare films that does not avoid the death of a child. This is much more important, as they both set the tone, as well as explaining much of the acting that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not doing well. The wife has distanced herself from the relationship and her husband is doing everything possible to try to bring her back. While some of the comments complained about their acting - one specified that they behave more like a father and a husband and wife daughter, and this is legitimate. He's trying to give her more direction. It is a role that men sometimes take. <br /> <br /> There are a number of fears in the film and most are quite non-violent, albeit somewhat grotesque. The story itself is very simple for most of the film and takes a strange turn towards the end. Although the turning point is not absurd, it is certainly not what you expected from the way things were progressing. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well done for something that seems to have been shot on video.
