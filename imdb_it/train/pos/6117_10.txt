All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you are even remotely a "PC" or you don't have a seriously messy sense of humor, then you probably won't understand it. As sick and disgusting as this film, it's really a comedy and not a "horror" movie. If you can appreciate someone pushing the limits of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits you can imagine, to the point that it becomes so out of control that it's comic, then you have to see this to believe it. This film is so out of control that an important movie studio could not touch it with a 10 foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, however, the best and most extreme works of art come from underground roads. If you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I saw stacks of terrible, boring, z-level Indy movies, which were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS or DVD-R tape. I also saw stacks of stink bombs from large studios that were a total waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET movie like these two by Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out and blows up all the other "shock" movies completely out of the water, you really need to take a second look at the whole scene of Indy's movie. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy filmmaker can have when working alone. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that the other people who saw this movie also "hated" to admit that they laughed all the time. I don't think it's possible for anyone to get bored watching one of these two. So, if you don't take everything you've seen in the mainstream media too seriously, and you're capable of laughing at a misanthrope, a puppet wielding puppet and finally bursting, you MUST WATCH THIS. You might be able to see it only for the stand-alone, the cult classic that it is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of over 1000 DVDs.
