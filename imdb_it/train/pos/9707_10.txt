About a year ago I finally gave up American television. I thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in England showed me some programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. It was then that I decided to switch to British television. Of all the shows listed above, The League of Gentlemen is easily the most obscure and twisted of all, providing guilty laughter and material that is not found in any other comedy I've ever seen. The characters included are the most unhappily married couple, a butcher who puts the ingredients in the flesh that are not said (probably for the better), an unbalanced couple who look in a local shop that only addresses the local population and the worst veterinarian of always. This program is one of the best I've seen.
