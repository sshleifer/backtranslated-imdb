This in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 70s. Not only does it have an exceptional cast but it is also loaded with wild shootings and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a Vietnam veteran (Kris Kristofferson) recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris starts to exploit his position and becomes as bad as the criminals was hired to get rid of. It's nice to see Kris playing against the guy. Both Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal offer great support as respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real movie star in this film. I don't think Vigilante Force is on video but occasionally shows up on TV. It's a great movie for kids who like movies.
