I have never known a film to stir up such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all-time classic. I was waiting for this movie as I had previously loved both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some of the negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I loved this movie and can't wait to see it again. This film is totally different from both of the aforementioned Ritchie films, and also much better. I have my choice of favorite directors, but none of them has taken such a big move as Guy Ritchie has just finished with this movie. I think he took the film to another level (I know most people would laugh at this comment for the reaction to this film, but I think time will prove me right). This film is very confusing and lasted much longer than 2 hours or so as I couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to put things together. Now I have a good idea of ​​everything that happens in this film (some answers with endless hours of reflection, some answers from reading other people's films) and now I can't wait until Sunday when I see him again. I just hope people go to the movies with an open mind and hopefully they will be rewarded like me and many others.
