EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the emotion that must have come with the birth of the narrative film almost a century ago. This film is truly unique and a brilliant work. Staging and editing are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film, they create a disturbing and unforgettable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow offers his great voice as a storyteller. <br /> <br /> A unique film of its kind! Four stars (maximum rating).
