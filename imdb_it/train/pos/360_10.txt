11 Oscar nominations and zero victory !!! I still have to figure out why - it's not like the actors in the film did anything better later, since you can do it by awarding prizes for trivial roles like they did with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover . they were all fantastic - I'm curious to have screenplays of discussions at the Oscars that year ...... should go to the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges .... <br /> <br /> It's a book fantastic - but true to Alice Walker's writing style she has a way of looking like she's exaggerating with her characters - so I'm so glad the screen adaptation took away some things. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was surprising - the African scenes live a lot to be desired - the African part of the book should be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that he can't think of Africa outside the Safari - so yes, there had to be a Zebra and wildlife tribute scene when we all know there is no West Africa ---- and especially because people speak Swahili --- who in the West speaks in Swahili ?? I just had to get it out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But like a story - incredible, film-making - out of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> I own and look at it when my soul needs a rejuvenation.
