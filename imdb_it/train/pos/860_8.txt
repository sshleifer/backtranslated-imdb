Audiard has made a very interesting film here. Begins with the description of a young, almost deaf woman, in her working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way to find someone in her life: but the boy is going out of prison. They both rejected by the company bring them together progressively. The description of the characters is complete, go into detail ... they both start helping each other; because he knows how to read on his lips, which turns out to be very useful for him ... He will progressively evolve, far from what he was in the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if in the end it turns into a film noir. The gesture is particularly well observed in Audiard's filming. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for Best Actess Cesar Awards for her masterful drama. The action towards the end of the film prevents him from being a simple "etude de moeurs". It's actually surprisingly fun: 8/10.
