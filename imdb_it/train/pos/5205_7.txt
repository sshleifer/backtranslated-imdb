A group of American students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Although they have been repeatedly warned of the dangers of getting off the beaten track (from the terrifying Irish local, natch), they do just that, and end up with their interior on the outside courtesy of a family of cannibals inbred (the descendants of the notorious clan of Sawney Bean, who according to the silly storyline of the film, has raised some sticks from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle. <br /> <br /> If you think that low-cost horror porn stars are automatically equal to tons of nudity and terrible acting, then rethinking: Evil Breed is fraught with adult stars, but in reality there is almost no nudity of what might be expected given the "talent" involved, and acting, even if far from worthy Oscars, it's not all bad (except for Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know how to do wonderfully 'French', but whose Irish is bad). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in a superb style with the brutal massacre of a couple of loving campers: after a brief sex under canvas, the improved silicone is hottie dragged out of the tent and torn in half; the boy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on a spit. It's a very bloody start, and bodes well for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things start to go seriously downhill: we are presented with the main characters, an annoying group of twenty-year-olds who beg to become cannibals and are subjected to a disproportionate amount of time in the form of terrible false spasms, a lot of complaints about the homicidal druids of the local Irish madman Gary (Simon Peacock), and worst of all, a sub-Scream conversation, postmodernist about the conventions of horror movies (what a genius!). <br /> <br /> So, just as it seems that the film will never improve, director Christian Viel decides to get serious: a guy gets a knife tucked in his head and there's a free sex scene in the shower with the beautiful blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT a porn star, but I'm sure there's a career waiting there if she wants it). After that, things get better quickly as the cannibals throw themselves into the best carnivorous gears, and the film turns into a real bloodbath: Gary has a machete stuck in his ass (on time!), And is strangled with his intestine; Ginger Lynn kick-box a mutant; Jenna Jameson is torn, eviscerated and has her silicone breast implant gnawed by confused cannibal; a boy is beheaded by a thread of cheese; and Taylor Hayes is seen bloody, livid and naked with a dead fetus between her legs (apparently, she was captured and used as a breeder). <br /> <br /> All this is so outrageously bloody as to pass the less interesting thing worth it, and earns Evil Breed a final rating of 7/10. <br /> <br /> NB. A very disturbed production and the intervention in the studio led Christian Viel to eventually abandon the project. Subsequent filming was done and the blood was heavily trimmed for a release in the United States. The good news is that, even if the film does not run as it should, and is cursed with a terrible ending, the UK DVD (the version I saw) seems to have remained relatively intact regarding the splatter (only 13 were cut from the film in total).
