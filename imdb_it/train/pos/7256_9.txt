I saw the long day die when it first came out in the cinema, I thought the film gave the soldiers a good point of view, gave a realistic account of the men in the war. The plot moves at a good pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to get back to their lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the lead role with conviction, just as Alan Dobie (as a German Helmut) was surprised, that I was not able to find this film on VHS or DVD , and I feel that it has become the forgotten film, which is sad, as it is superior to many other war films I have seen.
