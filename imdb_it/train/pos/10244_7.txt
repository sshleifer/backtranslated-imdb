I wouldn't call "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" simply a children's version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the first, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from an age into ours. But actually he opens my eyes when I see who has provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase this: a determined actor, the woman "Cheers", the host "Tonight Show", the most reliable name in News, a famous chef, the police chief "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN Boy. <br /> <br /> But I guess I shouldn't just focus on the cast. I thought this film had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). It is true, it is evasion, but the perceptive type. In fact I would say that John Goodman who makes Rex's voice is a sort of precursor of his voice in "Monsters Inc". Worth seeing.
