Ok, it was a damn nice episode. Much better than the credit it receives. <br /> <br /> The camera work is splendid. Even better. I love the final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are fantastic and the host cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about this episode is that many things have remained unexplained. why change sex? what is the purpose? and are they aliens? what type? why have they never shown up again in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I'm giving this episode three tall stars. One of my favorites again, but the holes in the plot annoy me. Anyway ... I won't let it ruin my entertainment.
