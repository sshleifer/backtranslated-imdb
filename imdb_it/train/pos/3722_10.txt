First of all I saw this film without knowing anything about it. I only knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called nighttime film festival, which is a lot of different films shown after hours the festival specializes in showing films that otherwise would not be shown in Danish theaters. <Br /> <br /> Anyway, my friend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how real he looked and that he really hit a chord with our feelings, we were really involved in the plot without being in able to understand end that is a great advantage in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish "dogma 95" initiative that was initiated by 4 Danish directors including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In the Dark). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the film is really worth seeing and offers a different perspective on how things were going for the American GI. Joe is expected to leave school to serve their country in battle away from home. <br /> <br /> Even Colin Farrell is exceptional in this film, I've never seen him before, but I'm looking forward to seeing him more than him. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
