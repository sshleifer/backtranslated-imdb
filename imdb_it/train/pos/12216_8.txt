The film enters the cinema only in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs have reached the public. Apparently the popularity of illegal DVDs has led to the theaters' release, with an audience still coming to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is a great epic, which brings Japanese culture into your home in an exciting way. In a sometimes humorous way, the story is told of a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since Kabuki's normal theatrical performances are something he finds boring. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the public might be a bit confused as to what story we're following, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male demon and a female demon leads to a great story for a new theatrical piece by Kabuki. <br /> <br /> the public is left in the dark if this is a story that should really have happened in Japanese traditions and mythology, but this does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told with a love of theater, expression, bright colors, humor and tragedy, makes this a great rollercoaster ride of Japanese cinema and theater. <br /> <br /> Let yourself go completely when watching this movie, try seeing it in a movie theater instead of on television at home. <br /> <br /> A critical point though: the soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of it is fantastic music, there are some moments in the film that I think should have chosen some more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that history contains moments of humor has meant that the director also chooses lighter moments in music.
