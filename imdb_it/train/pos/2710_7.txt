This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in the subgenre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who had already produced some WIPs at this point. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. The film takes place in a prison in the United States, not a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I'm not sure it was a wise move, but it's an acceptable change of pace. The director and screenwriter Demme really enters his work, always looking for new ways to present a familiar scenario. In fact, it's a bit too ambitious for his own good. The director creates some surreal dream sequences that are at the limit of expectations, but it's fun to see how hard it is to try to put this film above the typical chick film in chains. But don't worry, Demme still works within the parameters of the subgenus. There is a lot of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy the most ardent fans. The film is a bit slow, but it's very funny. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a veteran of the WIP, so she needs no introduction, and Barbara Steel is a hoot like a crazy guardian tied to a wheelchair. Pam Grier is seriously lacking, though.
