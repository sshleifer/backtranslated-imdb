When I first saw this film, the first thing I thought was that the film was more an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires who do incredible stunts. The stunts are very similar to the moves of the Matrix like moving too fast to project something similar and jumping very far. Another reason why the film is good is because the adorable souls face each other during the film. The way Gackt makes his pouty faces or the way they act, VERY SOUL. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this film is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde, they are also 10). ^ _ ~ If you are a fan of Gackt and Hyde, you have to see it.
