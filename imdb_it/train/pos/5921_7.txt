I was the production accountant for this film, and I also had to do some voice-over work on it, so I'm not entirely impartial, but if it were terrible, I'd say so. I thought it was a funny film, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, however, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible states that laughter is good as a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health. <br /> <br /> So many of the actors in this photo had not yet reached their peak when we made this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, is the one who has since become famous. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV each week as a photographer on the "Thirty-Something" television series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting people's dreams. One of my favorite personal actors in this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedian and a truly beautiful and sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think the fun comes true.
