Most of the complaints I've heard about in this movie come down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are pretty much the same. Yes, Kitamura redesigns some shots in the fighting scenes that arrive in the second half of the movie, but it's about where the similarities end. Versus essentially takes place outside, showing Kitamura's ability to create an interesting B movie in natural places. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small and cramped spaces. Here the art design has sunk into your face and WHAT is artistic design! We are treated in several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly confined to those spaces. Furthermore, a fundamental difference is that we do not get much action here until the end of the film. Versus was all based on action and beauty, here MUCH more emphasis is placed on the characters and the situation and gets confused with your mind. For this reason, Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You might not let him enter a scene at random to watch five or ten minutes of fresh zombie spills, but you sit glued to the screen for almost two hours watching the interaction of some really interesting characters. <br /> I am now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some New Zealanders. You should too! But make sure you understand that this is a different animal than Versus - it is often slow and requires some thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters takes it for the DVD version with R1 subtitles!
