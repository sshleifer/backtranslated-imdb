There are not many stories that exceed the strange ones similar to those of Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy in 1930 in Dublin, his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical. Although eventually correctly diagnosed, Brown, in a working class family with nearly 20 children, had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family. Through the use of his one perfectly functioning limb, his left leg, he learned to write and paint, both skills he developed with skill. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" such a great revisitation is its humility. Both the director / writer Jim Sheridan and the star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that does not scream for attention and uses melodrama. The battles and scenes of frustration and glorious moments of victory in minutes are easy pitfalls of such a miraculous story, yet "My Left Foot" remains real and intrinsically inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing to those with such serious physical problems must be a challenging task. Day-Lewis not only offers us a very complete picture of Christy, but also manages to chronicle the growth, improvement and inner change of the character at different stages of his life. He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited linguistic ability and was emotionally unstable, just as intensely as with Christy learning intellectually and struggling to deal with why he can't find non-platonic love. This last theme is the strongest film and it would have been nice for Sheridan and the co-adapter Shane Connaughton to realize it. Regardless, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all these elements, giving a performance that is so believable that you often don't have time to think "wow, it's such a great actor". These are the most commendable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about life and daily battles. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances that hinders his life, his struggles are not unlike ours and Sheridan completely grasps it. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, questions of self-esteem and ability. His struggles are only more manifested physically (literally and figuratively) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the great Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. Drama naturally evolves when tensions are higher and humor approaches in the same way. The dinner scene when Christy discovers that her doctor / teacher - the woman she loves - will marry her brother Peter is the most beautiful example of the film for both the efforts of Day-Lewis and Sheridan. It was built so well by Sheridan that it came out when we're ready and Day-Lewis takes us from there with his extraordinary work. <br /> <br /> The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. I didn't know he won the Oscar, but there was something about his performances as a loving and wise mother to Christy who just screamed at Oscar. His love for Christy and the constant fighting for him seem so convincing and felt and she gains much sympathy given her situation. <br /> <br /> The film's emotional punch given the story is surprisingly minimal. Perhaps it was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that felt organically human. The two should be reconcilable, but I imagine it's hard to tell a story that looks real and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster. The choice to minimize the latter was certainly the wisest for "My Left Foot". Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they don't need to be crushed for a stronger dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website moviemusereviews.com for more information
