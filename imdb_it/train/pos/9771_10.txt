Compelling and innovative! At the beginning of this criminally underrated film by Whoopi Goldberg, the authors draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the classic "Citizen Kane" of 1941 by Orson Welles. Writers are justified in designing such a seemingly disparate parallel, but viewer audiences are too often spellbound to see too many Hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his subordinates, much like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film is about finding love in everyone's differences. It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Anyone who has paired Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex has formulated a dyad for centuries, with the only justifiable comparisons including Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would like to see an exciting philosophical examination of celluloid on some of humanity's deepest impulses; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be displayed immediately!
