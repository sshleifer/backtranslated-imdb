I have to start with Ed Furlong on this. You have to. God bless this boy. $ 5 dollars says that the character he plays in this film is the one he really likes in real life. He has only one liner or two that made me almost suffocate because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the evidence that this guy has gone through in the last few years and it doesn't even seem that Furlong is even acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like that in real life." Does Madsen also have to act? Simply natural Vosloo has obviously gone from the Mummy-cast type. I think the biggest surprise of this film was the performance of Jordana Spiro. His reactions are apt in this film. I fought if it was hot or not, but I realized that I'd like to see more. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of "shoot'em out / ostage" movies. But what I'm a fan of are movies with a lot of twists to try to get you guessing. It's not just your standard thieves who take over a bank, kill hostages, and good guys win in the final type of movie. The twists continue to come ... and arrive. <br /> <br /> Cafe scenes work best with hand cams to show how it's really in there. Not glissando a little. Think of it as the Bourne Ultimatum "lite" style in some bar scenes. <br /> <br /> And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will take you on a double tour. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched I wondered why some actors had foreign accents and what they were doing in this small town. In the end it made sense that these people would smuggle stuff into other countries / states so that they could have these accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for the international audience with some of their stars that we might not have heard about. And some of them are smoking a lot. Moncia Dean? I have to say more.
