14 years since this show was made and it is still the best show ever made. The writing was first class and the production was second to none. This show would never have been realized today and this is a pity. I hope you're thinking of finding this show to see it. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year I left high school when my favorite TV show was the x file, which gives you an idea of ​​why I joined this show. AG was a far better program with better writing, but just a reason? I know this is not the only program to get just one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunslinger (x file spin off) he had good writing and was fun, but even just a season. It doesn't look right! <br /> <br /> We also need to remember that this show was in circulation before shows like Twilight made the shows "cool" dark, so I think this may have let him go to the show by going down the hill. <br /> <br /> Watch this program and have fun! 10 out of 10 for me.
