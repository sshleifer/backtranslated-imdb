As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman made an effective film on the violent side of man in DELIVERANCE, probably a definitive horror movie from the 70s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe ride along the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before being dammed into what Reynolds calls "a great dead lake ". /> <br /> But the local highlanders take a painfully obvious, blurred vision of these "city boys" who move in their woods. And the following day, continuing along the river, Beatty and Voight were sexually assaulted and raped (the infamous "SQUEAL!" Sequence of the film) by two ferocious mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism . /> <br /> James Dickey has adapted the script of his best-selling book and the result is a shocking and often disturbing shocker. Often known for his "SQUEAL!" and the sequences of "Dueling Banjos", DELIVERANCE is also a heart-pounding ordeal, with the four superb protagonists in their roles, and McKinney and Coward making two of the scariest villains of all time. A must for those who want to take the opportunity.
