Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television in that state of development. There are no such shows now, but rather sluts "housewives" by Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs of humor and witty jokes that clutter our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam approached Episode with such precision and with his usual madness that I can't help thinking that Rod Serling was adapting the show a week ago around Elam, even though it was an accessory to the flow of history. This episode ends with a turn, as usual, but the shock and humor are mixed with the particularly "serlingesque" dexterity. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
