Having seen only two of his photos previously, I came to terms with Altman. First though, I always labeled his film style as "boring". You just have to be in the right measure to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is quite underrated and very questionably out of print. Actually, I don't think it was even released on VHS. Why? When all these shit movies get DVD releases every day, is this left without reason? Honestly, I haven't had any real problems with this movie. It was, for the most part, always fun and entertaining. Almost all the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, whether it's wonderful dialogues or subtle performances. There is real skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's stint at the bottom of the pool halfway is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this little forgotten gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most of the mud out there that gets DVD releases. Hell, I'd be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> Often found on Fox Movie Channel, though, so be careful.
