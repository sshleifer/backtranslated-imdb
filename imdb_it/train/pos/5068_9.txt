This film is a wonderful film based on the life of a man called Gray Owl in 1930 in Canada. I found similar and compelling as "Rudy" and "Awakenings". He resumes the life of Gray Owl late and follows him in his most tumultuous and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film is about an Indian Canadian trapper who finds himself promoting the situation of the trapped Beaver. It also provides for the reduction of natural lands and the excessive use of the Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. Become a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather strange, but not outrageous. Anyone who wants to discuss this point must first watch the film to understand. Brosnan offers a wonderful performance like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place next to Brosnan is pleasantly natural compared to the forced pairings in the recent James Bond films. I will recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery or environmental causes. It is also a film for families, but children under 10 (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.
