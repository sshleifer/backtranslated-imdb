I waited a long time before someone filmed a faithful version of the classic novel by H.G. Wells, "War Of The Worlds". Timothy Hines has finally done it! I couldn't believe how beautiful it was! From acting, to costume, to special effects out of this world, I can't say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performance from a first-rate cast! It must be seen to be believed. I certainly didn't. And I read all those negative comments from others, and I can't believe what they were saying. We must have seen a different movie, eh? And those real negative comments from that Vepsaean guy, boy whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, sir. Hines.
