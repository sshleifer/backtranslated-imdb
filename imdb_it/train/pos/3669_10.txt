This film captures the absurd essence of an overbearing American patriot actor - one who believes his work (and his politics) are crucial to the American people like the views of the president himself. Alan Bates perfectly captures this mentality as Michael Baytes, and I will immortally remember Bates as this character. This is a film for Canadians and Americans alike. It is a precious piece of cinema, the one that is able to bring its audience through the magic of making a film and to reveal how easy it is for the producer and the director to lose complete control over the will of the actors and over the countless external forces. Wonderfully, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject it portrays: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control, and commands both the serious part of the "behind the scenes" of the film, and the film within the movie, "Flight to Bogota" with clarity and intuition. If you are interested in the intelligence and strength of Canadian cinema, "Hollywood North" is a great starting point.
