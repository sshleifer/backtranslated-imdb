I really enjoyed this movie. I bought it as soon as I found a copy of it. This film had so many emotions, and I felt so real, that I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I look at it, the ending makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools should show this movie, maybe keep people from wanting to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone. Especially those who have been hit by any school shootings. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the greatest movies of all time.
