I've just seen all 6 DVD episodes. The acting is excellent - no question. There was not enough action for me, I must say. No real suspense as such, just a lot of first-class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like a good slow and carefully told story, then this is for you. Peter Egan is the protagonist of Magnus Pym. <br /> <br /> The film represented the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so psychologically damaged from his unhappy childhood that the deception became his way of life in all things. As a child he loved his father, but his father was exposed over and over again as a con man and a con man. Pym did not betray ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence - he ate away his moral fiber. He has no real love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6-hour series. Very well done though.
