This film can be interpreted on many different levels. Don't listen to the other comments that have struck the film and say that it is a story or w / e played again and that it is just drugs. He has very obvious superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the film (and the reason why I think it was done personally) is not at all. He's really making fun of the psychology and conditioning of society. Show, for a split second, that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to show that all this cruelty to which we are exposed makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people. As for the logic scene, it is also reaching people who were in the smart 1% class with a federal mandate who are confused and frustrated because life is not predictable, mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level. You must apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty) not only to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adapt along the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. He could just go over your head; it's not for you it's for those people who have trouble managing life that doesn't work like a math problem. When you critically analyze a film or write your critical review, try not to read the back cover first (written by marketing experts and parapsychologists)
