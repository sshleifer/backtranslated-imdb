I went to this movie waiting for a film of artistic fear. What I got was frightening after the fright. It's a horror movie in its core. It's not as boring as the other horror films in which a haunted house has only ghosts and cold blood. This film doesn't even show you most of the deaths show the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept in which it's not just the house that haunted those who enter the house. They become bewitched, no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc After reading some external reviews, I'm really surprised that critics don't like this movie. I'll see him again this week and I'm thrilled. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 10 stars because it did what should be a horror movie. It scared the hell out of me.
