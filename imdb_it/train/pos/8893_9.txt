The 60s are a well-balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries, we follow a North American family, with 3 members. But we don't see them alone. We also follow the story of several characters like a black reverend, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is simply extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some shots of the Vietnam War, between the scenes. The next chapter doesn't start where the last one ends, it starts some time later, giving us a little mystery about what happened. In general, the mini series of the 60s is a must see, not only for hippy fanatics, but for everyone with little curiosity on the subject.
