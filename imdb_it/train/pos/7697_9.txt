This is another great film that I was lucky enough to see on the big screen for the first time (thanks to Rick Baker and others). In the late 80s I was a relatively new neophyte of the genre and only really new on the big three JC, SH and YB. I wasn't sure what to expect when I paid my hard-earned money to see him in a "triple bill of classics" at the old Scala. I didn't have to worry, I was breathless from this movie. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and haven't seen this movie, do it NOW!
