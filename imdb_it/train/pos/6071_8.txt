I argue, no matter how difficult I look, I will never find a better film version of "Othello". If you love the magnificent masterpieces of Kenneth Branagh "Much ado about nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I am I am sure you will also find "Otello" by Oliver Parker irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has held various splendid roles throughout his career. He was rather terrifying in "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I always considered his fun role as Furious Styles as his greatest success. This was, of course, long before I saw it. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and is probably in the most stimulating role of his entire career, but he does a fantastic and fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role of the bad cripple in history, Iago. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite of Shakespeare's ingenious works. He tackles his favorite subjects: dishonesty, envy, deceit and jealousy. This film adaptation is certainly one of the most beautiful films I've seen based on the works of William Shakespeare.
