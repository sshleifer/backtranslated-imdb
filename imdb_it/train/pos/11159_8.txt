This is a wonderful film ... The first impressions of cynicism and crassity are soon dispelled by a funny demonstration of how the basic motivations of men and women diverge (Vive la difference!) <br /> <br /> You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. Human beings are really a bit disgusting, but we have a big heart and we try our best, despite the temptations. It is not our fault that sometimes the temptation cannot be resisted, it is only what we are. <br /> <br /> There is a stylistic coherence from beginning to end; sharp photography and sharp composition, very pleasant vision when adding provocative content, well-adapted music and high-volume script laughter. <br /> <br /> Attention to the very young "solitary voice" ... brilliant; wisdom from innocence that balances comedy from the human condition.
