this film is a very relaxed romantic comedy, which is really enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a great job as the brilliant niece of Albert Einstein, even though she believes in her own abilities. Tim Robbins does the same good as the mechanic who falls in love with her when he enters his shop with her boyfriend after his car is full. I love Walter Matthau as the only and only Albert Einstein. This film looks very relaxing, while maintaining a certain seriousness (if possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> Personally I found this film extremely funny, especially the old scientists - I thought they were fabulous and hilarious! This film seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a brash sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
