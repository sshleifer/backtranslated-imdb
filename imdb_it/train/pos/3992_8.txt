While the film titles contain the word "Mother", the first thing that comes to mind will be a mother's love for her children. <br /> <br /> However, The Mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> Mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifices herself for the sake of her child. Here, Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half his age hurts people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig plays the role of James Bond, here, he plays Darren, a man who is helping to renovate his mother's son's house, and is also sleeping with his daughter. Anne Reid, who was a familiar face in the TV series, takes up the provocative role of the main character, May. <br /> <br /> The story begins with May facing the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, on a family visit to her son, Bobby. While making friends with Darren, a handyman who is doing renovations at Bobby's home, she was shocked to discover that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May was facing life after Toots' death. Fearing that Harry and Paula didn't want her, May begins to discover that his life is going astray, until he spends his afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was kind and friendly with May, and May will soon find a little affection for Darren. Instead of treating him as a friend, he treated the man who was about half his age with the love of a couple. Later, May found sexual pleasure from Darren, where he gave her the pleasure he could never find on anyone else. And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the breakup of a family. <br /> <br /> The mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to experience something she had never had in her life, and comfort on someone who is there for her on her shoulder. Since May it can be said to buy tea snacks for Darren to satisfy the sexual needs of a man younger than her, where he finally gave her more than he had hoped for. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid made a breakthrough for her role as May, as she was previously best known for her role in the TV series. Since she doesn't have many films in her career, her mother brings her to the critic's attention. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, had taken on a similar role in his film career, such as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his repressive role as James Bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his film years, and The Mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> The mother cannot be everyone's favorite, but it is certainly not the usual matinee show to accompany tea and muffins, accompanied by butter and jam.
