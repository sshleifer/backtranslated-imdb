Very pretty, very pre-Hays Code, and still very cheeky. I highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. It's fun, it's sexy, it works hard - and it loves that perm if you take it! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is as fantastic as a dozen flirtatious people who stand up in the world, perfectly played by a bank. John Wayne (in suit!) He plays one of his first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the sets, the lines, the clothes are added to a devil of a film that rises vertically in a horizontal position.
