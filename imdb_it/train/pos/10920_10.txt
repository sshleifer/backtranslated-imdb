I remember seeing this movie as a child. I don't remember where I saw it. I was about 14 years old. I thought the film was incredible and I wanted to see it again. He arrived on the Kung Fu channel once, but I lost him. I was really tired. It's the best Kung Fu special effects film I've seen to date! I highly recommend it, and now that I've discovered where to find it, I can enjoy it once again and for years to come. I also have to take a look at this film of Return of the Venom, which some have spoken so well.
