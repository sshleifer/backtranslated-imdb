in an unconventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorite ones as a child, and I remembered this recently, and thought I'd look for it. While many details are no longer clear in my mind, the general feeling that the film has given me has blocked me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent subjects, then I highly recommend this movie. He taught me a lot about life and death and aroused in me many emotions. To this day, it remains one of my favorite movies.
