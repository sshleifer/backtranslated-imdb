Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves a mark and makes you think. Set in Partition India, this film shows the true reality of Indian partition. Urmila gets top marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrait of a suffering woman with no choice. His freedom, his personal identity and respect for his family took away from one day to the next in a tragic controversy over the earth. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as his abuser of remorse. There are several moments in the film where one is brought to tears. The film in points is profoundly traumatic. Some partition scenes are chilling, but Urmila's resistance and survival are both remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to the woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film to which credit must be given for intelligent characters and narration.
