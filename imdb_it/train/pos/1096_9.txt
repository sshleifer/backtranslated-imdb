I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 in the midday commercial. After many successive views (and the purchase of the video) it still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a relic from another era - a domestic comedy set in the affluent bourgeois American class - but well executed it is well executed. But it is also a document of his time: a celebration of post-war optimism, of the baby boom and of the nascent age of consumers. This film is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful and sophisticated actors, the urbanist Melvyn Douglas; confused Cary Grant; Myrna Loy, with great determination, complement each other and a memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "It means we have to blow up" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> <br /> Love it.
