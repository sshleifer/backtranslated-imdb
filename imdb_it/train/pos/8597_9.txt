I liked this movie. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that never happened before: a Secret Service agent is going wrong and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison", they think it is the mole, but it is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally flawed agent who has a relationship with the First Lady! Since he is doing it, he is unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and this makes him suspect in the first place when it is revealed that there is a plot to kill the President. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" is forced to go on the run but at the same time is still trying to do the right thing, protecting the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I don't always care about people playing, but it's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here) as the fellow SS chief who hunts Douglas until he is convinced he has told the truth. When he does the two work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. By the way, even criminals are interesting. Moreover, I never - and never will, unfortunately - see a First Lady who looks as beautiful as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> This is simply a slick action movie that entertains from start to finish. Are there any holes? Obviously; probably a number of them, and a reason why you see so many critical comments. However, he was unfairly struck here. It's not smart enough for genes here on this site. My advice: relax, go ahead and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, eventually a bit of Rambo arrives, but otherwise it gets a high score for entertainment ..... which is what movies are.
