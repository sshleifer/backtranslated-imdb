At the moment, this must be one of the best comedies on television. It takes the sweet-sweet idea of ​​a show that revolves around a narrow family and transforms it into a fairly realistic but amusing representation of a typical complete family of twin brothers and brothers, brother brothers, over-protective fathers and baby sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney! <br /> <br /> To his credit, "8 Simple Rules" knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more. Too many shows (for example, "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") think only because its protagonists are now teenagers, so they should face social problems and end up losing their humor with too much impact. This is a trap that "8 simple rules" has avoided; he faces some problems (like being the outcast of the school) but having fun while doing it. In fact, the only time he was really serious is understandably when he sensibly handled the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think, even if John Ritter will be sadly missed because he was the reason the show left its mark, "8 Simple Rules" can still do well if he remembers his humor and doesn't make the father of Cate a second version of Paul Hennessy.
