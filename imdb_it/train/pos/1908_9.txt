This show is well done. When it first came out, I thought it was nothing but a carefree family comedy with a good number of lines. Many families seemed to express very well, with different concepts both of parents and children, however, as I said, I had never thought of it more than a good one-night watch. However, my view was projected out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastic John Ritter came. The program resisted and really praised the lives of the characters in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admirers of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything. When the show aired after the passage of Ritters, I really wanted to hug my dad and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought this shone the acting talent of the three children, particularly that of Bridget's character, who was worried about the last words she had told him. It reminded me that no matter what horrible things I say to my father, I don't understand them and it's very important that he knows it. Great show
