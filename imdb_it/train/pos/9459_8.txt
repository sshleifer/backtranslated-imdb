I look at romantic comedies with some hesitation, because romantic comedies present old clich√©s that make a film uninteresting. Typically in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a boy, both in love, then they have problems, and then overcome problems by getting married or whatever. But, this film is a different story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies I've seen recently. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed boy (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and talks for a while after Marie leaves. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to become significant, we get a breakthrough. Marie is her brother's girlfriend. Unhearted by the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes he loves her, and Marie loves him too, but their love would not only be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell does well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And everything else is done well. It's a good movie, look at it.
