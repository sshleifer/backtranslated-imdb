The most satisfying element of "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is wonderfully realistic. The Oscar-winning casting Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was an excellent decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thankfully, properly aged for the part! If this film had been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: chicks stupid, chauvinistic boys and squalid jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is witty and has fun, smiles smart everywhere. While other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that make the audience laugh, the lines of "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and intelligent and involve public thinking. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious and average daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say whether this was a personal choice on his part or a choice by the director. However, his character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is only a small flaw in the film, and does not detract from the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and stupid comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful and carefree comedy.
