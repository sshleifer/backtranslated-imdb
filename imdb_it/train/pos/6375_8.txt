Despite having a great respect for Disney's animated films, lately it wasn't really what I would call "not to be missed". Atlantis seemed intriguing from the first poster and trailer of the film, and fortunately it lived up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature for a Disney Film movie in fact), and focuses more on action and the discovery of any other recent Disney offer. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the core of the earth, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, to then slowly develop into real ecosystems, which, although usually contain some memory of hardness, become increasingly intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is not reached. The presentation of the simple landscape and setting of Atlantis, without some cheerful songs, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of a language of Atlantis, as well as attempts to link it to the mythology of the ancient civilizations of real life, add to this, and it works quite well. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole Scherzi pratiche, there does not seem to be much of an "infantile" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he needed to know the place, helping the Atlanteans to discover parts of their history that they didn't know. Part of this involves the "weapons" of Atlantis, which are used in a very action-packed climax that is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Of course, not the whole story makes sense, and the film does not present any new extraordinary computer-generated visual effects, but, apart from the Toy Story films, this is the funniest Disney movie I've ever seen in the last few years.
