What a great movie! Finally an image that reveals an unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. The well known Rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? <br /> <br /> However, Still Crazy is probably the best rock n'roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap, for example. Why? Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different point of view on rock, love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth, they lack so much. Beyond the story itself, we see characters with their personality, weakness and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Spend a good time watching this (listen to the incredible soundtrack!) and finally think about your future. <br /> <br /> Hi!
