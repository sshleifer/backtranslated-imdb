Two years have passed and for the most part everyone looks different, some good and others worse. I still enjoyed myself as much as I did the original. <br /> <br /> Some flaws have had to change the Joker which now has no red lips and looks more blackish hair and black pupils, hes still voiced by Mark Hamill which is an advantage, I think. They made Poison Ivy more white suggesting that it is becoming more like a plant and Catwomen looks very different and not as "attractive" as it was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and the Scarecrow it looks like crap, especially the Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as dark as the original because Batman does not work alone as before. Most of the time he works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to the rescue often. Batman has given up the yellow logo and with the black wing on the suit and it seems to have gotten a little bigger, but he still has a lot of kicking ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original especially for some of the renewed characters, but the stories are more exciting than ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" could be one of the greatest Batman episodes, so be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> Total 8-9 / 10
