It was in 1988, when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television). At that time, I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since he won the Montreux Film Festival bronze rose in 1986). Of course I recorded all the shows on tape and watched it again and again, especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene in which Ronnie stopped in front of a painting by Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself "I need a shave". Or more fun than anyone, when he played ball with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It's a pity, that Spitting Image seems to fall by the wayside; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent TV programs ever. Compared to other satirical transmissions it was certainly the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been almost 20 years since then, and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
