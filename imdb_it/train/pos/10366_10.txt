An unskilled "10" The level of writing and acting in this Australian film recalls the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill combines the Streep line for the line, and takes to take - is one of the best showcases of his prodigious acting talent and is at his best sexy and splendid, despite the intensity of his role. This compelling film is a pleasure for any film lover who loves a moving drama, interpreted in the most human but not sentimental terms. The film - which has won numerous awards in Australia - boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but also wonderful and authentic Australian venues. It shows that people are the same all over the world. And, after all these years, people still enjoy repeating the famous Streep line, the accent and all the rest: "A dingo ate moy's baby!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld".
