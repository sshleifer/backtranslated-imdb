In all the comments that praised or condemned Dalton's performance, I thought it was excellent. He does not interpret Rochester as a rich and spoiled boy, but as a clever, a powerful man. I liked this version, even though the appearance of the video was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St. John were never accentuated enough. I give this a 8.
