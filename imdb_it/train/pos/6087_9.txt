I saw this movie in the first two weeks it came out, (I don't remember exactly when.) I thought it was right, for a Ben Stiller movie. This film is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's lines, you have to think about them. Or like I said you have a good sense of humor. From a couple of people on this site I saw that people had nothing good to say and didn't get a very good score, but I would have given them a bigger one. best score. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I'm just giving you an opinion of another person.
