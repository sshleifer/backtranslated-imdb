ROAD TO PERDITION can be summarized by Thomas Newman's score. It is disturbing and beautiful, but you are aware that this music is similar to Newman's other works and while you listen to the soundtrack you can think of SCENT OF A WOMAN, MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION remind you of other films as the story takes place on the screen. While the Sullivans lead America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man who thinks of THE GETAWAY, Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING while the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by the epic of Coppola and Leone. Despite having seen all this before, it should not be taken as a heavy criticism of the Sam Mendes film that I repeat is disturbing and beautiful and the only flaws that contrast it is a very slow opening of twenty minutes and I was a bit confused as to the events that caused Michael Sullivan's betrayal. But if you stop to consider how much a sentimental mess Spielberg may have made with the story that revolves around a father and the twelve-year-old son who runs for their life, you can't help but think about what a superb director Mendes is. > <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a film in which the entire cast offers impeccable performances. I've never been so excited about Tom Hanks, but he's just as good here as he is in a leading role, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but at no time did I believe I was looking at an American legend on the screen by putting a fake accent - Newman's performance works because of subtle body language, his character is torn by the sense of blame, but Newman never milk or over the top. While not distorting Newman, who gives the best interpretation of the film, the two British actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a lead actor he wonders how Daniel Craig could have progressed as a character actor if had not decided to become James Bond, a role that heralds the end of the career of actors
