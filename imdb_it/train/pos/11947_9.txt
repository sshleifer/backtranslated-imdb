Simply well written, directed and acted ... Woody is the best of the 2000s if not his best since the 80s !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody shows how well-rounded an actress she has become. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing not to be in a love story on the screen with the protagonist. Play the perfect enchanted magician. <br /> <br /> There have been some reviews that gave life to this film. Don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully made movie. People in the crowd I saw with this were laughing so hard at some lines that I lost the next line. If you like Woody Allen movies from the 70s, you will regret losing this. I suggest you go see this movie with an open mind, if you do, you could go out smiling.
