The inspirational story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, aspiring to be the first black diving master in the history of the Navy. We are shown the series of battles of childhood on which Brashear must overcome in order to realize his dream (and therefore to keep him alive.) No less important than the challenges was the Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert De Niro), the head coach of the Navy's diving school sends Brashear, who is not particularly supportive of Brashear's goals, but who eventually becomes an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; fast pace and with a lot of action, even if not an "action" photo in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very human story here, and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there is also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old navy" against the "new navy"). The performances are quite good, in particular Goodings. I thought that DeNiro was a bit exaggerated in his Sunday portrait (although, who knows, Sunday may have been this extreme type of loose cannon) and the portrait of Sunday's wife Gwen (Charlize Theron) also made me doubt these parts have been "revived" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though. I never wondered if it was worth attending. <br /> <br /> 7/10
