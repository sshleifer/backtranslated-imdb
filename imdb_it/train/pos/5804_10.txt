Michael Jackson is no longer very popular in the United States, however in Europe (particularly in Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it has no plot, it is full of clichés, Michael is constantly praised. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can't expect a plot or non-cliché in this type of movie! It has fun visual effects and the music is perfect. The fragment Smooth Criminal - the greatest song ever, full of Moonwalks, dance groups and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces with a good looking (and white ... ) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance fans. <br /> <br /> However, since I am a fan of MJ, I should warn all the enemies of Michael Jackson out there: DO NOT watch this movie, you would just increase your hatred ...
