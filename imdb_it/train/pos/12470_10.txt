I just watched this movie on TV .. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young and this film surely touched me .. <br /> <br /> I can hear the lost child Desi felt .. <br /> <br /> the feeling of wanting to see his father again ... <br /> <br /> wanting to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> or at least I was given the chance to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> and I am so moved by the letter that was rewritten .. <br /> <br /> saying that his father read his letter, and sent it back to someone to answer him and buy her a gift because there is no shop in heaven .. <br /> <br /> it just makes me feel that miracles exist ...
