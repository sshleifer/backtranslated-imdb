I love Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year and a concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. The doodlebops don't teach the alphabet or the numbers but who cares? are you serious? TV does not mean teaching your children numbers or the alphabet. parents should get over it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can say that all three have beautiful voices and DO NOT sing their lips. Imagine, they dance, jump around and STILL sing. they have talent, children love them and I even enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best TV show for children. And a rock band for kids. How incredible is it? Why do people say that Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear? Whether he is or not, it's great! Leave him alone. It's not that he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children!
