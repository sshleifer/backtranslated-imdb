The wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels sorry for her profession, feeling that it is useless to help her patients. A young drugged gambling client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he really wants to help him get better. Here she is involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal the plot again it would ruin a funny movie and "House of Games" could be the best scam movie I've ever seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem full of snappy dialogues, big jokes and enough twists to make you guess until the end. Crouse is as perfect as the tense psychiatrist who needs change and Mantegna surpasses her as the devilishly clever con man. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film is in absolute control of its audience; and we're loving the con. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
