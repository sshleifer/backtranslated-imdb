Hey folks, how are you? I'm the man, the one and only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ... you can't really write a review on Sakura's script, because we didn't have one there. As far as I know, the story was invented as we went along. I had the best time of my life to make that movie, and I became so smelly to leave short of Jism ........... fun times. I'm so glad you enjoyed the whole movie. I really couldn't do the fights I had imagined. Whenever I made moves, the fight director kept changing them. Anyway, I had a great time and met some really great people. Especially the purple Ninja that seems to have fallen into the scene of the film.
