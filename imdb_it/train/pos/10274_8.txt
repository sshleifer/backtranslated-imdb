SPOILERS This is a compelling film about beggars. But who is cheating here? When does the hunter become the prey? This dark and dark film is slow and seductive. It drags you and drags you along the proverbial garden path, just to stop you thinking you're safe. <br /> <br /> It has a compelling script, with good acting (at least from the protagonists). I didn't notice the background music, but it was never jarring, so it must have been done well. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I don't usually like it but it sucked me in and kept me hooked until the end.
