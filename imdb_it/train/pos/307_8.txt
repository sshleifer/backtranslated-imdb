"They All Laughed" is one of those little films that I always recommend to friends looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the romantic traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly 80s atmosphere doesn't date too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the entire enterprise so light on his feet that reality never causes it to fall to earth. But having said that, this kind of little film relies on actors to keep it active, and "TAL" is blessed by a dream cast that understands the needs of this type of story. It is a film that will not remain so long in the memory if it weren't for the small moments provided by the excellent cast: Colleen Camp simultaneously shouted orders to John Ritter and his dog; Blaine Novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment when Dorothy Stratten falls in love with John Ritter and says "How ... weird". It is such a piece of hair that you don't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it certainly leaves it with a light heart and a smile on your face.
