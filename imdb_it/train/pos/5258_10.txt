The Ladies Man is a fun laugh, with a very varied cast and very silly but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). Ferrell is his usual quality in a brilliant secondary role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays a surprisingly good idiot and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in every play out there. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will still make you laugh as hard as the first time. <br /> <br /> I am shocked to think that at the time of this writing there is a paltry 4.7 / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember the children: "There is more movement in the ocean"
