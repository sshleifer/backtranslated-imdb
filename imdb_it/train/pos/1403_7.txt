Paul Verhoeven (genius and master director) reacts with anything but perfect, yet amusing in an "old dirty way of doing", Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the slasher's final act disappoints. Yet I am giving a recommendation to this film for the special effects MIND BLOWING (perhaps the best so far) and for two dandy performances of the leads. Verhoeven's moral questions are obviously inspiring, and although the film has turned many off, this film is rather soft-core for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two main flaws: Josh Brolin (aka ape-man walking) and the entire agreement with the lift. If there was an access ladder, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> A funny horror film for a Saturday night.
