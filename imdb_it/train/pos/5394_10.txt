I was absolutely mesmerized by this series from the moment Tom Long came on the scene: the whole "bad boy" thing was just compelling. <br /> <br /> History has enthralled you, what will happen next - Joey eventually the girl, having done 5 years in prison, and all the time thinking about her lost love, meeting up with her again, discovering to have a child ... Even if he is a violent villain, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> A real brilliant parter - please take it out on video!
