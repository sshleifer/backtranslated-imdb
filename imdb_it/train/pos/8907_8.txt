I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. I had heard of this film, but I never had any opinion about it. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was impressed by what I saw. I was genuinely out of my mind in some parts and I certainly remember jumping on my seat a couple of times. <br /> <br /> The Blob looked scary. Now, I look in a jar of jam and wonder if it will hang on my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was as good as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the film. I also liked the old one at the beginning. <br /> <br /> For a horror movie from the 50s, this was done very well even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
