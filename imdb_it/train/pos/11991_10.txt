Ah, Talespin! What can I say that hasn't already been said about this great show? Anything! This is without doubt one of the most well-written shows I've ever seen, live-action or animation. The most recent stuff is too idiotic for my taste, and some of the "mature" things I have to escort children out of the room for. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are engaging and very plausible. Some of them could even be stretched to an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic while being fun for both children and adults. Then there are the pure comic episodes like the Bluest by Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh to tears in a select few. <br /> <br /> The dramatic aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays (at least, those that are not specifically oriented towards it), especially in cartoons. In the episode Stormy Weather, for example, Kit Cloudkicker decides he will join an air circus, but Baloo believes it would be too dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, to whom Kit screams "NO! You can't tell me what to do! YOU'RE NOT * MY * * Dad *!" and hides his face in his pillow. The next day he leaves for the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be welcome in those created today. <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depth to them. Baloo is practically as he is in the jungle book, more or less some degree of laziness. Rebecca is a smart businesswoman whose ideas on how to get money, while in theory they are good, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a pretty girl, but you can't be fooled. Sometimes it can be a real hell. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break relationships. Watch his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: it looks like he's ready to let it through a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the drama combined with the real chemistry between the characters that make this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is well demonstrated in Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo takes the word of Kit for this Seymour is abusing animals in his aquarium instead of siding with other adults. The relationship between Baloo and Becky is also realistic, because Baloo's motivation for the job comes from wanting to buy back the old Sea Duck, not necessarily the desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he got the Duck back, he would still do Rebecca's work. <br /> <br /> The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other floors of the series, is designed quite realistically. The functions of the plane do not change once throughout the series (continuity like that is difficult to find even) and, unlike most other "super floors" of other cartoons, it does not have a single weapon on board (unless you don't count mangos!), and instead relies on his great skill as a cunning pilot to get out of trouble. It's hard to think of a hero's vehicle that doesn't have some sort of cannon turret, laser cannon or even a gun somewhere on board. And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. Plus it's just such a beautiful design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Never. Period. Surely it is worth all ten stars!
