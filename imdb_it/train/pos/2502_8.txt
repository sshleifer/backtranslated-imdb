This film surprised me! Never having heard of Hyde of Gackt I didn't expect much! The reason I wanted to see this movie was because someone said that the movie contained some action series series in the style of John Woo! Normally I am very careful when this is required! There is only one John Woo and to date there has not been a director approaching his genius when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" would have a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with the vampires who set the gun on fire! It looks promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this film is that the pace was very slow! It takes time to set the mood! This film contains some good Hong Kong-style action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It is a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship to one another! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very credible as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to jump! Example: when a gang member dies (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drink blood from one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most friends are no longer together! Even without a proper reason, Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know this is done to add some serious drama! Because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it feels obligated! Apart from the flaws in the plot, this film has an atmosphere and a fluidity that makes it hard not to love this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But that's right! The overall experience you get is moving and sincere!
