An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known but they left to hate each other. More than 20 years later, I agree to meet for a TV special ... but they discover that they STILL hate each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. <br /> <br /> A great success in his time and won George Burns as best supporting actor. I (somehow) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon, then his non-stop one-liners. Some were funny but making jokes about Willy and Al's senility was NOT. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Even his character here is so caustic that you quickly get sick of him. All this apart was fun. Burns is simply awesome to hurl the one-liners with ease and even Matthau was good at it. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the film. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's nephew who tries to convince the two to work together. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. This jump began his career in style and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So this is good. Simply good, not great. Matthau's character makes it really hard to love. I give him a 7.
