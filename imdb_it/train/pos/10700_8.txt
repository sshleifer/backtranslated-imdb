This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you walk away pretending to know or you care what communism is and how real the Russians or the English are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and fun. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid being completely obscured by Nicole, and the rest of the cast also does a good job. The final is in motion, logical - the logic of films, of course. It is worth looking at, if you accept the rules of the game.
