My opinion: use his family plot with excellent performances and some genuine moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the President of the United States, the first traitor to the United States Secret Service. While his fellow intelligence agents chase after him, he tries to prove his innocence. Obviously we know his innocent, and the real culprit is around the corner, but I was still amused by THE SENTINEL. In this time when thrillers are reduced to being too ridiculous and too abundant in action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good return to all those good old-fashioned political thrillers. The family plot is elevated by thrilling sequences and terrifying performance. Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is the long-serving secret service agent Pete Garrison, who is framed to be part of a plot to assassinate the president. Former secret service colleagues (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing Harrison as he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret services. This leads to many hunting scenes that, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never incredible. The script also offers a subplot in which Garrison has a relationship with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). This fortunately was not superfluous, as most subplots are for this type of film. <br /> <br /> The director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) who manages to make the film beautiful. Although many have criticized him as "should have been a TV movie", I disagree. Okay, this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigue like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode of TV series 24 (which this movie closely remembers when it comes to style and star Sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot in great heights and does not abandon even its smallest details. The performances are fantastic (with a first-rate cast, it's inevitable, even with the script of the numbers. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, I press *** 1/2, not perfect, but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: *** 1/2 of 5.
