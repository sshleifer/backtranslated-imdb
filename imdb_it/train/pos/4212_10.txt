Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal and well-made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently acquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Jean Peters is also interested as a tough guy who is used as a courier by his evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It is film-noir at its best and even if the performances are very good its leading actress Thelma Ritter who steals the film. Like Moe, an exasperated peddler who sells ties (and also sells information), she's fantastic in a role that earned her another Oscar nomination. It is surprising that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Oscar and has never won. This should have been the role he did for her!
