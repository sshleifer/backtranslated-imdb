People don't seem to give Lensman enough credit. Some problems that are fundamental to understanding Lensman's experience have been neglected. <br /> <br /> Year: For the year it was made (1984), Lensman presents some of the most amazing effects I've ever seen. As a person who looks at many of the early 1980s, Lensman is unique in its use of what appear to be computer-generated images at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim's battle against the geometric labyrinths in the laser maze can be considered an excellent example of this. Every time I look, I have to keep telling myself that it was 1984 when it was done. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks I've ever heard, and this mad hysterical rhythm permeates every corner of the film. Lensman heavily borrowed two Western errors and managed to manage the former a bit - the need to fill every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is well tuned and galvanizes scenes like the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx, the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance of Chris. It is interesting to note that constant music hindered my attempts to remove noise when I was storing the lensman from the analogue tape to the digital format - since there was not a single second of silence available to use as a reference point. <br /> Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has more or less the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the SW princess and her name seems suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. He assumes the role of Han Solos flying with the ship and with some technical skills. Buzzkirk: a clear improvement by Chewbaka. The goal - a beautiful concrete copy of the force that has less chance of preaching Christianity to the public than the original SW. While strength is based on conviction much more than concentration, the goal is a pure instrument of concentration. Theoretically, anyone could challenge the goal. The goal is much more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The Boskone alliance has interesting sponges made from meatballs. They seem to be attackers only with red uniforms instead of white ones. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was beautiful if only it had been developed. The galactic alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called) the 1960s series in which the Xylons were fighting. There were not enough ships to send battles for me - this is much better in Lensman's second film. <br /> <br /> Finally a note on Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design that fortunately continues with the second film. <br /> <br />
