Especially for a time when not much science fiction was filmed (1973), this is a terrifying vision of a future where everything went wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It's set in New York in 2022 (I think), and reminds you of your worst view of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I was able to appreciate the acting of Charlton Heston after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps he is) capable of portraying a series of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here, he is divided between being a policeman who is just a little bit corrupt (taking rare food from the rich), and is totally corrupt (actively forgiving evil). <br /> <br /> The film looks like everything is going on at night, and sweat is dripping off everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I had never seen it before, I knew the famous ending (which will not be revealed here), but the ending is certainly foreshadowed. <br /> <br /> Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: going to the council (made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then go to Thanatopsis to have a look. <br /> <br /> Gritty, dystopian sci-fi pre-Star Wars.
