This film has everything, action, combat, dance, bull riding, music, beautiful girls. This film is an authenic look in Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Lots of money for oil, lots of women and lots of honky tonks. Too bad they all went now. The film is essentially another boy who meets a girl, the boy loses a girl, the boy goes back, but is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no film with better music than this movie, and this includes American Graffiti. It is a film that I watch again and again and I never get tired. Every time I look at him, I'm young again, and it's time to go out with honky tonking. The only reason I only gave a 9 is because you can't vote for a zero movie, I don't think you should vote 10.
