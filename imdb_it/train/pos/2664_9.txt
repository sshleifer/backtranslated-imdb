Although The Shining has more than a quarter of a century, I challenge anyone not to be frightened by the descent of Jack Nicholson into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to tear it; instead it has been reported over and over again in pop culture. The twins, the blood lift, RedRum, the crazy "unwritten" who writes ... this should be seen, if nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in everyday life. The film is at once scary, full of suspense, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And that's what is usually missing in horror films: a fantastic script.
