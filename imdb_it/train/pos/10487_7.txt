Saving Grace is a pleasant film with its heart in the right place. Grace is a recently widowed and realizes that her late husband left her with many debts. He could lose his beautiful home and saw no other solution to his unhappiness than to start growing marijuana. He lives in a beautiful village where most spectators would like to live and the villagers are all wonderful people that most spectators would like to have as neighbors. There is only one thing wrong with this picture and this is how they portray the effect marijuana has on its user. It is obvious that none of the actors or writers of this film ever smoked the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a cane is ridiculous and only seemingly fun. It is in those scenes that humor is replaced by English slapstick, and this is a pity in a film that is still very pleasant.
