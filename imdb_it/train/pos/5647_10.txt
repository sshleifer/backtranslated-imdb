I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a real shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone has the good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD !!!! I rushed to the store and got a copy and I'm happy to say that it's just as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and disturbing character, and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network has not continued. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who loves gender and those who have not seen it, must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to see him when she was on television (20 years old) is very interested and will soon be a fan. He finds him "very twisted" and appreciated the episodes he saw. I look forward to seeing the episodes that have not been transmitted. <br /> <br /> This show sucks !!!!
