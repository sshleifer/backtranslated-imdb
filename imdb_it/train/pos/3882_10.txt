I saw this tape, I immediately rewound it, I looked at it again and I laughed twice as hard. I highly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful but uncomfortable with transvestites. It shows you that transvestism is a characteristic rather than the entirety of one's being. Comedy is not a single problem. This man is brilliant. All comics should aspire to his level of candor, intelligence and talent.
