An intelligent, undeniably fun game, played by Peter Ustinov as a career embezzler with his eyes on a US conglomerate in London. He is welcomed by Fox (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened by the exposure of the jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a robbery movie with a lot of brains. Ustinov is exceptional as is Smith and Newhart is quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, like the pill that breaks out "executive vice president". Malden was rarely so free. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some amusing cameos. The excellent soundtrack is by Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Till is lively and the screenplay by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first-rate and very intelligent. Have fun!
