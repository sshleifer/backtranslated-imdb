Oh, it's great to see a Silent Classic for once! The director Vidor is simply delicious and even makes a long cameo (at least for 1928) as himself. The story is about life success and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comic studio to be part of a larger "dramatic" study. Become a big star and the consequences are truly alien to the real world. For a moment he even denies her past (poor)! The cameos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene in which the protagonist (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that it doesn't seem so special ... It must be one of the first film-in-films here and for true fanatics it is great to see the cameras and the material of that time. A must see if you ask me !!
