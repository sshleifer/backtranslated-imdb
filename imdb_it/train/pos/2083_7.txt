This film was an interesting Hollywood film about the eponymous novel by Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think that it is full of racial stereotypes, for the moment the very idea of ​​the Chinese protagonists has been progressive in and of itself. I discovered that the white actors who played Chinese were not as bad as I expected, which was not the Asian equivalent of blackface. At the time, there really were no Asian actors in America (not even George Takei acted) and Rainer did a good job with his part. It wasn't the greatest performance I've ever seen, but for the old school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. I wonder if the release times during the Great Depression turn this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheavals that shock peasant farmers and the way they seem to be left behind by all this. <br /> <br /> The film has some parallels with John Ford's style, but I think that the eastern influence also influenced it. If this had been a western family, eventually the grasshoppers would have won, punishing the peasant for his pride, his lust and his greed. However here he learns his lesson, then he wins.
