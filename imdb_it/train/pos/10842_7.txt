So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy in the video store, he said it sounded similar to Still Crazy. So I rented it. Have I been disappointed? Well, yes, since Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 1970s at the height of the popularity of a great rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members are all struggling to make a living, and the opportunity to play a concert on the twentieth anniversary of this festival is offered. They welcome the offer and decide to reform permanently, visiting Europe in the process. The result is some rather amusing hijys, and all the characters undergo subtle changes. Watching this movie, you feel more like a spectator of a carefully modified documentary than a participant. And it's not bad at all.
