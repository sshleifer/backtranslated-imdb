The Odd Couple is a comic gem. One of the funniest scripts ever made for celluloid - surpassed only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends: the obsessive compulsive Felix and the dark, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because it is impossible to live with his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film, and after an abortive suicide attempt he moves in with his poker partner Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is brilliant and full of brilliant lines. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke but still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comic timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to free his breasts in the restaurant and when the Pigeon sisters are charmed by a very pretty Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element. This requires repeated views!
