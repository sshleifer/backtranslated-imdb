I saw the description of the film on TCM and I let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked the film and found it quite exceptional. Sure, it's seriously dated, but as a vintage piece it's worth looking only for the subtle humor in the intuition of life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD, so I can watch it more often. I was also very busy with the interpretations of Smith and Ustinov as protagonists, and of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the cameo appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
