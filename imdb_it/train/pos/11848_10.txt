Well, what can I say, this film really struck me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really loved it, even if the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it's not. First of all I liked the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the film. According to the simple story, and the drama of the Spirit attracts your attention. One thing I like most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with other horses, it makes the film more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they do it ?, But ... I don't know, make people talk the animals is just so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just to children :), because it is very relaxing.
