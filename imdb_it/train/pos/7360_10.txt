Wow! This is a good movie! The acting wasn't good at all, but if you look at some moments of the movie, rewind and watch it again, it's brilliant! The man at the beginning of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. WOW! I would not have ever expected. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet that kind of smokers against those three was one of his companions who sold the drugs later. And the genius mentions: "beautiful nuances, I need a couple of yours ... if you think you can take them ..." ... simply brilliant! And the fights are the best I've seen in a while. Look at the second guy who knocks down after hitting the first boy's head against the table. WHAT A SHOT! And in the middle of the movie, a guy in a car shot once, then 3 guys fall, he's really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoots Jason Peters after his distractions. Jason Peters falls down and rolls again while he's dead! I can't say in more words how beautiful this movie is!
