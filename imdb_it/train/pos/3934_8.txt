The young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic and beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time making it human enough for the people to care about. It is perhaps the best interpretation of the actors. See how he interrupts a group of lynchings on his own. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple peasant woman. Most of the last part of the film takes place in a courtroom, and there you find the only negative thing I can say about this movie. Most characters from the judge to the spectators are given so many humorous lines that it distracts from the serious test that is at hand. But I'm quite used to this because humor is a Ford brand. The support parts of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
