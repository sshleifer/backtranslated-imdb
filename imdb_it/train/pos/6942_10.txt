In the fifties the age restrictions for films in Brazil were as follows: no restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Usually westerns were allowed for ten years, when they had a little more violence they went to 14, but it was rare to see a small western for under-18s. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think this explains very well how this film was considered different from the average. The hero, James Stewart was fighting against his brother who had killed his father. He was looking for revenge and seemed rather traumatized, away from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried variations on this type of character in the upcoming films he made with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the protagonist was anything but virtuous, she continued to follow the man who was left with the gun. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those big bad guys who will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man with the gun, is one of the most suitable for a western. It was to be transformed into a film by Fritz Lang, which was not made. When he was offered to Mann, he decided to start over from scratch and take nothing for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of the West, while still retaining all its traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to watch again and again, but nothing will compare to the impression it made on those who saw it when it was released.
