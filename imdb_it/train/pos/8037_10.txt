"One shot, one kill, without exception." A must see if you are in marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! Great general storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Close enough to the real thing. But this is not a film to be demolished and to identify editing flaws. this is to sit down and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth but this film is not exactly what makes you think. it's about enjoying the lifestyle and the action of the sniper. sniper 2 and 3 are followed pretty well, but the first is still the best film in general. Tom Berenger does a great job interpreting his character and showing the hidden side of sniper life. the plan to face all death. To see for sniper fans.
