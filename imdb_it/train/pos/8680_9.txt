Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the comic book market. This market is essentially dominated by the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies shorts from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to release hidden gems, like "To Spring", an amazing story about the most beautiful season of the year. /> <br /> In the environment represented here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is manufactured. And by whom? Of small male elves living underground. Every spring, when the snow starts to melt, they start to work. They start by breaking down the columns of rainbow rock, then reducing them to rubble and using these rubble to turn them into color fluids, which will be moved to the ground and bringing grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the comic describes the manufacture of the spring, but the second part is slightly different. Old Man Winter returns and tries to prolong the winter by destroying the work of the elves. So from this point we witness a battle between the elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> The music heard here is delightfully wonderful. The melodic parts stick to the head like an ink stain on a sheet of paper. The melodies of the second part are electrifying and adapt perfectly to the action. This is simply fantastic, Giorgio! Animated sequences are also a pleasure. The colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown in a huge epic environment. The same concept is brilliant. The elves attract characters, so Old Man Winter, which effectively interprets the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong message included here. The battle seems lost for the elves to the end, until a single late elf does not jump to action and leads to the victory of the elves during the winter. So the point is: only one person can make the difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "To Spring" is a remarkable lost classic of the cartoon era. What is even more remarkable is that the director of this cartoon made its debut here. And who is the director of "To Spring"? He's a certain William Hanna ...
