The brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not only for the affections of Debra Winger but in reality for a secret of their childhood that has left them in contrast with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (firefighters behaving like a Greek choir chant), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to the way the American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song that could get ~ but with fire ~ and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his trailer on a rockin 'a' She's a lady '~ invaluable;) <br /> <br /> the best missing line in the quotation marks section btw ~' Once you've had a clown, never come back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the DVD from the United States) and if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happiest with Legally Blond 3 don't send you back ~ try it :)
