German private TV is little known for copying Dutch and ?? naturally ?? USA formats Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, xeroxing went only to the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> Can't you stand screwball comedy? Don't look at Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you still expect a drama from another lawyer similar to Law & Order or something like that, well, go somewhere else. (Or look at Law & Order as it is quite brilliant in what it does, but I digress.) E&S is fun, often tackles challenging themes, it's fun, romantic, fun, funny and witty. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I am rather dismayed that the writers did not get better agreements after the serial final. And my cynical nature needs to readjust: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: look at it. I have no idea how the English synchronization is, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy ending included.
