I will never forget this movie or the events that lead to Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic, but it must be said. Powers Boothe gives an impressive performance as leader Rev. Jim Jones from darkness to total insanity. He would have won an Academy Award easily if it had been released in cinemas. It's the kind of mini series you'll never forget. You will not forget the images of his boss's brutality, control and obsession. His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. Mass suicide is horrible, almost unreal for anyone's imagination as to why so many people (900+) went willingly or resisted JOnes's orders. They no longer make mini-series like these where we were without an open mouth and hungry to know what happened to others.
