The President's man is the second film of a future TV series, with Norris in the title role and with young actors like Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills (one of the young "Walker" rangers). The old master teaches the young aspirant. It is one of the most powerful themes of "The President's Man". In this tima, "A line in the sand" has reached the world surprise for its control of terrorism in the United States, months before the tragic September 11th. Eric Norris, son of Chuck, is the director. The film is fun, a good job, lots of fights and heroism. Chuck Norris has many plans for the future.
