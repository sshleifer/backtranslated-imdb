Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV some time ago and I remembered this production as less exciting than most Beeb costume dramas. I reviewed the DVD this week and I still get the same impression. At the beginning it is a beautiful story, but it weakens when the heroine becomes so terribly brave and noble and returns to her husband completely disgusting when he is sick and I feel so totally irritated by his holiness. I suppose this was the "right thing to do" when the story was written, as well as contributing much anguish, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband, since marriage no longer made her her own, not talk of continuing scandalously with a lover, how I expect the modern public would have liked to see. But it is difficult to take sanctification today and especially when this heroine had a strong, courageous admirer ready to defend her against anyone. So the story as in the film is equivocal. It is well done as a novel, but a little irritating as in the genre of life today. <br /> <br /> The hero of goodwill Gilbert was certainly a saint to bear with the variable and often cryptic behavior of his ladylove and with persistent self-denial and to be so consistently supportive So I felt very embarrassed the fact that when Helen was finally free to be with him, the script didn't allow him a little more than a minute before falling over each other for a quick hug before the titles came out. This was completely ridiculous when we were waiting all this time through all that dripping feeling on the undeserved husband for a discreet dialogue and a good hug between hero and heroine. Instead, the ending was as if the filmmakers had run out of time or finances or simply could not be disturbed. "Here you are - one minute, do what you can in this, then cut how the director wants to go home now ....." I felt totally dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very high commendations to the acting of Toby Stephens, a perfect and very beautiful hero, and Rupert Graves a superbly bad and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfying within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather hypocritical victim for most of the time. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I love these classic dramas and practically all of them are a better view of much of the "modern" drama on TV these days. So, 7 stars because despite the irritations it's still a good watch.
