I was happy to finally see the release of Amazing Stories the first season on DVD. I had forgotten what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series. For a long time the only way to see this extraordinary series was with the VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when Sci-Fi would resume episodes. However, when science fiction would host the replicas, they generally clung to the same episodes. There were some outstanding episodes in the first season like The Mission that they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series lasted? Says 1985-1987 at the top here on IMDb, but I thought it lasted more than two years. If you love Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed by your purchase.
