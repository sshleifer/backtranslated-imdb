One of my favorite movies saw him for the first time when I was about 10 years old, which probably tells you a lot about the kind of humor. Although dated, humor certainly has a charm. Expect to see the usual jokes about Askey and Murdoch so popular in his day, with many interesting and extravagant characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple who will get married and find herself in trouble from "she", and my favorite, the stationmaster, "Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes .." Interesting the ghost train is It was written by Arnold Ridley of the fame of Dads Army (Godfrey the private doctor). Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile.
