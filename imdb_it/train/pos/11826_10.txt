I never saw the midnight screening of a movie before "Dick Tracy" was released. <br /> <br /> I still have the "ticket for the shirt" that I had to wear to be admitted to the screening here somewhere and, like that shirt, "Dick Tracy" has stayed with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the film, the sharp images, the bright primary colors and the strong characters are undoubtedly engraved in your brain. It's a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here, taking a familiar American icon and recreating it for a whole new era. Always set in the 1930s, "Tracy" has timeless quality like all good movies do. I lost track of how many times I saw "Tracy" and I continue to capture something new every time I do. <br /> <br /> The others are all top notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is a relevance as, in the right environment, it can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still issues such as the need for the family, staying true to oneself, good versus evil, even Machiavellian issues are explored. Strange for a comic film, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic in its own right. Compared to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It is a good film, strong that does not depend on blood, violence, obscenity or nudity to express his point of view. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
