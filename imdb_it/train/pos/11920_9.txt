Christopher Lloyd is fun and really believable as "Al the head angel". This film is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first one didn't have and a much better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> OK - it was written for children, but adults have as much fun as children. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but it is NOT a taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and also looks very human in his emotions, as well as showing a real acting talent for change, a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> Look at least once: it's worth taking it.
