"Hollywood Hotel" is a moving, exuberant, wonderfully entertaining musical by Warners that is sadly overlooked. It should be remembered, if nothing else, to provide the official acronym of Tinseltown - "Hurray for Hollywood". The soundtrack by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems, including the fascinating "I'm Like a Fish Out of Water" and "Silhouetted in the Moonlight". The best musical number is "Let it be a lesson for you", in which Dick Powell and the company describe the misadventures of people who have found themselves "behind the eight-balls", a destiny that literally falls on the searing Edgar Kennedy to the fine number. The image celebrates Hollywood glamor and pierces it all at once, as it gets a lot of comic mileage from pompous and ego-manic actors and duplicate studio executives. The cast includes a group of great character comedians: Allyn Joslyn as a skilled press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's aspiring manager, Fritz Feld as an exciting client, Glenda Farrell as Mona's sarcastic Gal Friday Marshall, Edgar Kennedy Mega Todd, Mona's bratty sister, and Hugh Herbert as her father, a little goofy. The "racist" element mentioned in another review here is a ten second bit in which Herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo "Gone with the Wind" sequence. It's of questionable taste, but it shouldn't stop you from seeing the other delights in this film, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I believe is the only movie available on this incredible jazz combination. The "Dark Eyes" sequence goes on a little too long and comes too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem, it's worth spending your time and definitely a movie that should be considered for the publication of DVD.
