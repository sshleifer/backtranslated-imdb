This - and certainly not a little overrated Southern Soap Opera - was the biggest epic released in the most beautiful year in Hollywood in 1939. I don't want to repeat the obvious: Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. gives superb comic performances. However, I want to note two other less understood elements of this masterpiece. The magnificent final battle sequence, while the marvelous Sam Jaffe laboriously ascends to the height of the temple to blow his trumpet and warn the regiment, is simply grandiose. It never fails to fascinate me. Another undervalued element in the film is the performance of Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a well-designed, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander the Great") bad. Indeed, parallels can be seen between this mystical and evil nationalist and a certain well-known figure of the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi trait? Not exactly. But still, a huge, funny, moving epic.
