The fourth Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Don't dare to say that Pokemon sucks! I don't like it when people say this .... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should have fun with Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please tell Pokemon is fantastic and should be appreciated by people of all ages. And also, why do the hate Pokemon give low ratings for all or most Pokemon movies? I don't understand ... They shouldn't do it ... There is absolutely no reason why people should simply vote without proving that Pokemon sucks besides the fact that: 1) Pokemon is ONLY for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people don't like Pokemon.
