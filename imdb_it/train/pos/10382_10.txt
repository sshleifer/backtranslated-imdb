As with all other reviewers, this film has been a constant in my mind for 30 years. I remember going to the library to look for everything I could about this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, I was able to discover that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Fastward to 2002, after years of searching on eBay for a weekly magazine and here it is, a VHS copy of the film. There was another bidder but I was determined to win this movie. The loser wrote me asking for a copy I gave her. Despite having a copy of it, I still searched and searched to finally find a site that sold a copy of the DVD movie.
