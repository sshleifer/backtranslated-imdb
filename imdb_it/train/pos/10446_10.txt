I saw this movie 10 years ago. and I watched it on video an average of once a year since then. it's the kind of film that is timeless, because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversations are so personal. it is also one of the very few films that captures you from the first to the last credit sheet, despite the fact that there are actually only two (very engaging) characters. this owes much to the engaging acting of hawke and delpy, which make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first film I saw that mentioned the reality of TV, and now the phenomenon is rampant! I like the way this film wraps the audience in its space and makes you think, tired as it may be, that you're one of those characters. also made me want to go by train around Europe! I haven't met anyone who hasn't been able to relate to this film. maybe this is about myself, my friends or just the huge genius of this movie.
