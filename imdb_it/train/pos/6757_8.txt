Dana Andrews is "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in this 1950 film starring Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City detective sergeant Mark Dixon, a cop with a bad temper who got into trouble in the past for beating the suspects. When a man is murdered in a mafia-owned gaming club, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his companion go to investigate. Scalise blames the murder of Ken Paine (Stevens), who left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but with the victim. Dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed by mobster men. He goes to see Paine and, not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war, he hits him on the ground and inadvertently kills him. Now he must cover the murder. As a further complication, he falls in love with Morgan; his father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after seeing that Paine had hit his daughter, is arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is a really terrifying and gritty noir with some good performances. Andrews, robust and atmospheric, is as convincing as a tough but nervous detective who must stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The film brings him together with his fabulous costar "Laura", Gene Tierney, and she is as adorable as a model with bad taste in men who apparently are used to being abused. Little does he know, he has another on his hands. Ken Tully does a fantastic job like his father, who protests his innocence despite some overwhelming evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, fast and engaging film is the ending. Pure Hollywood and, putting myself in Tierney's place, I doubt I'd react the same way. A small criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I didn't find it as majestic as "Laura", but few things in this world are. If you like the film noir, this is a must see.
