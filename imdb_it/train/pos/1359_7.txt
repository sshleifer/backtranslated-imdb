I work in a library and I expect to appreciate this film when it was released 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute as his boyfriend (he couldn't act but when he looks like him who cares?) But the movie was bad. It wasn't funny or cute or much of anything. Posey kept the film afloat with his energy. But did you learn the Dewey Decimal OVERNIGHT system and then stored tons of books to the beat of the music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with her appearance when she became a real librarian at the end - hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let that stereotype go please? Worth seeing for Posey and Townsend but that's it. The TV series was much better.
