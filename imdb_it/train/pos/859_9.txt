It is so rare to find a film that provides a plot that cannot be identified at every turn. Surprises to delight everyone. <br /> <br /> A couple of things I can't understand is that here you have the female protagonist who plays "the good girl, the hard worker" and yet in the end it ends up being an anti-social risk buyer. It wasn't enough not to please me, but he gave me a break. <br /> <br /> The other thing I couldn't get was the old man being taken away by the police at the end of the film. I never understood who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to know what they could be. <br /> <br /> The film was exciting and fun and always let me guess. A lot to see
