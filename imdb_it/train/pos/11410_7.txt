EDMUND LOWE (which reminds me a bit of Warren William), directs the beautiful cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a fast pace and runs just over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who seems to be intent on his own end (hypnotism, anyone?), and suspects include a good number of supporting cast - all from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt , Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Advisor. As an added bonus, there's Nat Pendleton in the role of a detective and, in addition, you take a load of that art deco decorating the luxurious interiors of a wealthy home. It must have been a set that was used in many later films. <br /> <br /> The positive side is that the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with the reasonable certainty of not being too baffled. It's all suddenly clear to Detective Philo Vance - and then he has one last fight with the killer who gives the film fifty-five minutes of absolute suspense. <br /> <br /> Well done and spend your time in a fun way.
