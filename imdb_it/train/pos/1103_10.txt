This film has some of the greatest comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever brought together in one movie! The plot is somewhat lacking, but the delicious jokes are enough to make up for the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that you will surely enjoy. As a cinematographic art form it is a lot of fun; and with the biggest stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you be wrong? <br /> <br /> Dialogue and timing of this kind have long been underestimated and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this movie: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received negative reviews and comments from viewers. Achieving true comic dialogue is an art.
