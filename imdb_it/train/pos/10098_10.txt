Dominion Tank Police has no doubts, one of the most incredible shows ever made, but not only in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of action and fun, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated in exactly the same way as the first part. The subtleties are really out of the world and the characterization is beyond all limits. You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the complexities of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, the Bonaparte Tank literally jumps over a tank shell and makes no sense. One could also question the plausibility of Bonaparte who jumps on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was beautiful. Buaku rules.
