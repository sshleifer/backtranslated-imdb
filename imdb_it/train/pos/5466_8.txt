Excellent pre-code amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck as a new inspiration (written by Nietzsche!) To banish her sensitivity and exploit herself, use men to her advantage. Not very honest for the German philosopher, but interesting that this was the year when Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do much for me, but certainly behaves well here, driving herself and the film forward. There is no more meat on display as would be expected, but many daring situations and surprising jokes and allusions. Very funny, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men, and I honestly suppose not a very attractive view of the female digging gold. Anyway, this is life!
