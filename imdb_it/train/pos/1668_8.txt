Artimisia was late last night. At first I didn't think I'd like it, but seeing that I didn't want to sleep yet and there was nothing else, I kept watching and I felt intrigued by the young Artimisia, virgin, pure and passionate. His love story with the old Tassi sparked recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level and not on reality, I loved it much more than the usual biographies or costume drama. Great game, great camerash, great music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more! :-)
