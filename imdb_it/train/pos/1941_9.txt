Actually I thought it was a comedy and I sat and watched it expecting to laugh at my ass. It soon became clear that this is not a comedy, or at least a 'Jim Carrey' type. what he kept looking at were the characters - the film starts with some rather tormented and tormented people, gathered to try to fight one of their basic fears: the fear of water, the fear of swimming. we begin to take their lives little by little, we see their problems, we imagine their thoughts. <br /> <br /> I actually made it seem a lot more obscure than it actually is, and besides the chain of events it soon brings some light and I hope in their lives. <br /> <br /> I probably would not have seen the film if I had known that it was not a comedy but rather a drama, but I enjoyed it, I enjoyed the story and I don't mind spending about 90 minutes with it. <br /> <br /> many films deal with alienation among people in the western world, this film shows how people can get together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and if to light of the day of death you meet her, do not let her pass and leave her, do not lose her, she is your gift from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> peace and love
