This is almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this film slightly unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very rough, almost amateur. But I think Lynch does it on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical Lynch reasons, such as: floating camera work; haunting music; long pauses (atrocious); hanging curtains; dim lights darken at a slow pace (almost indiscernible); extreme close-ups; issues of women in difficulty; overcrowded, incompetent characters, all aware that they are confronted with characters who are upset, temporarily unaware, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The shows are great and the short is inspiring. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered and this ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort by Lynch. I just hope you make some short films, more along the lines of your Sony PlayStation 2 ads. They were inspired.
