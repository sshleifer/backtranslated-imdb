"My daughter, my sister, dream <br /> <br /> What a sweet impression it would seem <br /> <br /> We were in that kind of land to live together, <br /> <br /> And there slow love and long, <br /> <br /> We love and die between <br /> <br /> Those scenes that you imagine, that sumptuous time. "<br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> < br /> Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be described in a sentence ?? it takes place in the early 1920s when four women from London, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It's the correct description, but it won't prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - a last film "feel good" is the perfection of its kind. Beautiful and sunny, tender and peaceful, gentle and magical, it is like a ray of sunlight on your face during the spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the film that has affected my life. I looked at it during the difficult moments in which I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to face the sad and tragic events and come to terms with some unflattering truths about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and I hope that everything can be changed and everything is possible. I had promised myself that, no matter what, I would pull out of misery and self-pity and appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone. <br /> <br /> Charming, fascinating and moving, "Enchanted April" is one of the best films ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a very high quality diamond.
