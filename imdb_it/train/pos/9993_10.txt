Brooks' most extravagant and fun movie I've ever seen. I can watch and review the tape 100 times. I laugh my a ** off and I cry in some moments. It's a really nice and funny movie, and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionaire) goes into the street without a roof for 30 days to win the entire poor district from his competitor. Reality bites, but in the end - it's hot relationships between humans ... I highly recommend!
