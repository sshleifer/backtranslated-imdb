The Maxx is a deep psychological introspection slightly camouflaged like a strange superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in a dirty city with no name, driven by crime, and she and everyone she knows have a lot of problems to work with. The Maxx is his friend and client, a street bum who thinks he's a superhero in costume - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> The Maxx is not to be missed for the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent vocal work - especially the late barry Stigler, exquisitely urban and mischievous, of the main villain, Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, don't lose it.
