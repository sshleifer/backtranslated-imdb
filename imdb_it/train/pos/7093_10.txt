With 'Twelve Monkeys' you have to pay attention, but if you do that you will probably find much to appreciate. I know I did it. The story is interesting and deals with time travel. A virus killed many people in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) was sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), which probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the psychiatric hospital while chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe Cole's stories. <br /> <br /> The film constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, is collected in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, someone appears only a few seconds after the call. Things like these happen throughout the movie so you have to be careful. You could ask a few questions but since you can't have an answer by yourself, it is better to agree with the film. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkeys' works like science fiction, with some fantastic images and a gloomy atmosphere and works like a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next and this helps the film. It may have some flaws in the story, but since it is an imaginary thing like time travel, you should accept what the movie tells us and try to enjoy it. This was the easy part for me.
