I think that usually I approach the comedies of the film festival with the low expectation that they are invariably "bizarre" and that any expected humor will only come at the expense of the simplicity of the characters in front of a complicated context. The great thing about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film, while finding it with a bitter humor in one scene after another. There was a refinement, perhaps due partly to the hard work of the DP, I rarely saw in an independent film, and even more rarely in a comedy. Of special note here: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy the math teacher. After seeing this performance I cannot understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a wider audience. It brings the necessary mix of anger and sympathy for the role that really helps this image reach its potential. This is a fantastic job that deserves a wider audience. I can't wait to learn more from the director and this cast!
