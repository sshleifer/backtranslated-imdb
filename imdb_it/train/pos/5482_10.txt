This is a stunning film. In addition to showing the actual footage of the key events in the failed coup to oust Chavez, we are given the underlying image that describes a class-divided society. Many of the rich, it seems, have a choice with the popular democratic choice and are willing to use the army for regime change. "Watch what you say in front of your servants" is a revealing comment. The head of the largest oil company in the country is named as the new president, with the support of the United States, and these young Irish filmmakers have everything in focus. A great film to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation on how the media can be manipulated and used forcibly, in the interests of large companies, against the interests of people's democratic desires. Interesting things.
