OK, I overestimated it a little to make up for at least one of those bad reviews. But I liked it. I didn't laugh so hard, but it aroused my interest and dragged me without letting me fall at any point. Built history Yes, you knew it would have a happy ending - this genre always does. Meanwhile, it was weird with gag sight that you could lose, so be careful when watching. Stiller and Black have delivered competently once again. Good team. They should work harder together. I don't know that it will be a cult classic, but it was definitely a fun run. Not as good as WHAT ON BOB, or SCOUNDRELS DIRTY ROTTEN but what is it? However, it is worthwhile to make some way to see this film.
