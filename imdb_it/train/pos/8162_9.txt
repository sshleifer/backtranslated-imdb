Like Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen turns a wonderfully unbalanced performance into "The Dentist". <br /> <br /> With its already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the IRS that persecutes him and a wife who acts very suspicious; Dr. Alan Feinstone is increasingly losing his sanity. <br /> <br /> When the Doctor realizes that his wife is having an affair with the pool boy, he stages a series of events that bring torture, murder, total crime! "The Dentist" is a solid film! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone recognizable and usable at the same time. Even if he is completely out of his pumpkin, the audience will still feel sympathy for him. May my friends ..... be damn good. <br /> <br /> A beautiful cast of secondary actors completes this gem of a movie. Excellent direction, good killings and a cool head, and an effective rhythm will entertain you during the execution of the films. <br /> <br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
