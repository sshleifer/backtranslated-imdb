From the top shelf of the great classic books, comes this masterful story written by Pearl Buck. The book as the film is called "The Good Earth". It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese peasant who starts his day with a trip to the "Big House" where he took a slave called O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made his wife. Almost from the beginning, he began to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near his new home. During the following years, O-Lan demonstrates its value by firmly sharing the efforts, problems and fortunes of her husband. During the years that pass, they raise a family and look at their simple family atmosphere both the party and the hunger. In fact, it is at the lowest point of their lives that everyone discovers the value of companionship, loyalty and love. With the changing times, their growing family is both helped and threatened with friends and relatives, like their uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a rascal and a charlatan, but is tolerated with compassion. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise him and remind him of the fragile and fickle nature of life. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke who plays Wang's Elder Son and Phillip Ahn who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all types of audiences. ****
