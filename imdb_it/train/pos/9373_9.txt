Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the real thing - the noir movies of the 1940s - but Red Rock West has been a real pleasure for all of us who want the past. The term "neo-noir" has been so often misused in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserved to be described as such. The casting is perfect in everything and he would have felt at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so narrow that it is hooked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated it. Many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them as they used to, and I'm not even that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future by paying homage to the past.
