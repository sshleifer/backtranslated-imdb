"Dressed to Kill" is certainly one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It is a tense, elegant and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence. The acting is pretty good, the orchestral soundtrack by Pino Donaggio is unforgettable and there are many surprises to entertain thriller fans. "Dressed to Kill" is a murder mystery involving a sexually frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Caine) and a high-priced call girl (Nancy Allen The murderer in film is a transsexual by the name of Bobbi who is also one of Caine's patients.The film is full of breathtaking moments: the infamous murder scene in the elevator is extremely elegant and rather bloody.Highly recommended.
