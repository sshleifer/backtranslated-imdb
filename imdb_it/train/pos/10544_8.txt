Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and difficult ideas I've ever seen talking about movies. They had only one scenario, a group of actors and a plot. So what made him so special were all the effective directions, the great dialogues, and a bizarre condition that the characters had to face as mice in a maze. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was all about his story, but it wasn't as good as "Cube", but here are the characters that are tested again as rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and brings Vincenzo back to his "Cube days", enclosing the characters once again in a very different space, with no more time to play with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a sci-fi thriller (even some of the teasers and incorrect advertising trailers seemed so), "Nothing" is a free and light comedy that certainly can be called a modern satire on our society and also on the intolerant world we are living. Once again Vicenzo amazes us with a great idea in such a small kind of thing. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, it's all you have more time and you don't need anything else. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" confused, "Nothing" is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate. <br /> <br /> This film demonstrates once again that a smart idea means more than just a millionaire budget. Of course sometimes the film fails, but its main idea means a lot and compensates for every defect. There is nothing else to say about this film because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in "Cube" movies.
