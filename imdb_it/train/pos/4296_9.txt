This would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991, except that it was beaten by the brilliant JFK. This is a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories where the lives of different characters intersect with others and how to face their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but he's eclipsed by Danny Glover and, above all, by Steve Martin. I've never liked Martin or his style, but he's fantastic here. I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end of the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great writer of dialogues, along the roads of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought plots, and messages that give a positive touch to our lives. A really excellent film. 4 out of 4 stars
