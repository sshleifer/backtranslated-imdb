Shooting is pleasant and the environment is extremely realistic. I liked that courageously rededicated the conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morals of the Chinese countryside - mainland of the 1930s and other fundamental human issues - I felt I could get a real sense of the times, recreated even in splendid shots of traditional Chinese theater and in the purist depictions of street life. It seemed worth the experiment. The intertwined role that Buddhism plays is probably the truest form - both in its humble and philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective I have seen in the Chinese film. The casting is fantastic. The images are memorable. Acting is pretty solid. Thematically childish but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of his expression.
