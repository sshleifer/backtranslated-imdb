This very particular scenario of Wagner's latest work has definitely grown on me. When I first saw it, I was a little annoyed by many of the surreal images in the film, and I felt that too much was superimposed on the story. However, if you can handle a good deal of quite sophisticated "gimmicks", I think you will discover that the film manages to capture the very strange and worldly atmosphere of the opera, and that there are particularly fine moments. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever played it. His performance (a mimic synchronized with the lips of the singer voice of Yvonne Minton) is nothing short of dazzling, from one end to the other, and alone justifies the hours needed to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason for The Joy of This Film is that it captures Robert Lloyd's spectacular interpretation of Gurnemanz's crucial role, which Lloyd has cruelly played in opera houses around the world. I had the privilege of enjoying it several times in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, and the sensuality of his voice, and the warm and paternal interpretation of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved, as were his performances in the two main monologues of the character, the scene of Karfreitag and the recognition of the prophecy in act 1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a videotape made for America, and so there were the subtitles that, alas, could not be eliminated. This is particularly unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely Christian interpretation into a film that is already forcing layers of interpretation to work. This seemed to me rather contrary both to the clear EVOLUTION of Wagner's Christianity and to his deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of history. (See note with spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it almost impossible, when watching a movie with subtitles, not to absorb them, and we strongly recommend that if you have the option to turn the subtitles off in the DVD versions, you do , and instead, if the work is not familiar to you, read the booklet carefully in advance. <br /> <br /> The point is that in the film there is a lot that I don't like, and as soon as I've seen it done differently ... but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since I got it seen for the first time, and I find myself attracted to enjoying it again and again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> FOOTNOTE CONTAINING SPOILER: A good example would be Kundry's famous phrase, "I saw him ... he ... and he laughed". This is translated, in the subtitles, for reasons that escape me, such as "I saw the face of the Savior". It is particularly irritating to me, because in the whole booklet, Wagner refers in a very deliberate and attentive way to this invisible character WHO DOES NOT NEED TO BE THE BIBLICAL Jesus as "der Heiland", that is the German of "The Healer" - a referring to the wound of Amfortas and all the wounds and diseases and the need for healing.
