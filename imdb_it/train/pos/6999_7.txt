Seven Pounds plays Will Smith in the role of Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has an additional reason to meet those who have fallen behind on their taxes. Thomas caused the death of seven people while driving by telephone and the film follows his attempt to try to atone for his crime frankly unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The plot is as thin as a brick a window of a green house. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the Titanic finale was more surprising than Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is happening. <br /> <br /> Normally I like Will Smith only when he is in Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when he shows off a gun, drives a Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah", like every time he tries to take serious action, he looks like a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar that is so obviously desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I didn't watch the movie, even though it's very subdued here. There are comedy flashes but they are subtle, in fact it was the most underrated performance of Will Smith that I have ever seen and for this reason alone it was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was also great: Rosario Dawson gave the impression of being in the cinema and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were as good as all the other players. <br /> <br /> Overall he's a whiner - but he's not launching all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violins to give you any choice but to cry. There have been a few times that even my hardened heart has almost broken. You will be forced not to find one of the situations that do not affect your life, which makes it even more real. <br /> <br /> I'd give him 8/10. Will Smith's exhibition moves on the drama without all the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and is presented far better.
