I loved this movie, you have to respect the dwarves dressed like little Martians. Of course, sometimes the story may have been subtle, but you can't take away the way it was made. I looked at him over and over again when I was 8 years old. It's a children's film, and besides, it has some of the greatest quotes of all time. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" rendition is fantastic. <br /> <br /> very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
