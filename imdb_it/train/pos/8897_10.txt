My sister and I rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so challenging to watch. However, the film far exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It is much more than a simple representation of a century. He has some very real portraits of the characters inside and most of the actors do an extraordinary job. The different stories are prepared together with real footage from the moment it gives a truly unique touch. While watching it, I really felt that I cared about what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to give Julia Stiles endless praise in her portrait of Katie, she was great in a way that stands out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone ..
