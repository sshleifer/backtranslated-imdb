The most succinct way of describing Ride With The Devil is with one word: authenticity. I will not repeat what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much the historical research and the meticulous attention to detail that the crew certainly had was appreciated by this filmgoer. <br /> <br /> As a student of history who is familiar with the period and the setting of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fiction films concerning "Bleeding Kansas". Yes, there have been freedoms about real events, as all fiction can do. But the general feeling of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (without the hindsight with the PC here) even the actors seem authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small part in the film) seemed to have taken a picture in the middle of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> A few spectators with whom I spoke expressed their disbelief in the stylized dialogue. They cannot believe that nineteenth-century farmers "spoke like poets". <br /> <br /> What they don't realize is that in this age of verbal snobbery, the nineteenth-century American public was surprisingly educated and eloquent. These people were raised on Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible. The writers have reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging by the documentation of the time. The stylized dialogue simply adds the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> But in addition to a historical document, this film also works on a visceral level. Beautifully photographed and interpreted, it recalls the days of the great western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, done so many times in the past in so many other minor films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This film has everything an attentive spectator could want. <br /> <br /> In a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like American Beauty, this great work of art was buried by an indifferent study system. But I'm sure Ride With The Devil will be given, it's expected in the next few years. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
