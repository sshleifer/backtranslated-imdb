Rene Clair's revolutionary musical. If you want to see where the songs first drove a story, this is the right place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who discovers he has won the lottery just as his creditors call. Unfortunately his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend's apartment and was given to a convict on the run who then ... oh, but that would be to say. <br /> <br /> This is a light and frothy story in which much of the dialogue is sung (most people think this has not happened until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movies that don't make anymore and rarely do it when they do it. He plays a film from the earliest times that sounds like a movie from five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in ways that not even Busby Berkeley was doing (though, to tell the truth, the confrontation between the two directors is unfair since Berkeley was essentially doing stage-related dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through "the real world"). It's a great little movie. and it's a fascinating film that will make you smile. It's just a soft pleasure. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can't say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's all you need to know.
