This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell who was not a great director, but who made some good films including the 1937 version of "The Prsoner of Zenda". Set in a London that only Hollywood could handle, atmospheric but nothing like reality, it is a story of obsession and contrasted love, from Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait to see it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a big fan of Bette Davis wanted to see it in a role considered one of his first big names. So I bought it. Well, she was fine, but I'm sorry to say that her London cockney accent made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest actors in the cinema, make no mistake, but she did it here. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It wasn't as creepy as Dick Van Dyke's "Mary Poppins" cockney accent but very close. <br /> <br /> In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. Supporting actors behave well. It is worth looking at despite Ms Davis's vocal gymnastics.
