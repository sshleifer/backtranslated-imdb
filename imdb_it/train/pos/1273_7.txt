A simple film at the beginning, a simple film at the end. It has that infinite and fake clich√©, but most TV movies have this. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as a former scammer. The marriage between her and the woman she works for, seems a bit strange to me, but, I believe, for the period of time in which it is set, that nobody-less credible. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the modified "tv" version, even if the film was made and shown on "tv", I also find it a bit strange. But, I feel that if I saw the totality of the piece, I would probably give the same evaluation. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but, again ... a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
