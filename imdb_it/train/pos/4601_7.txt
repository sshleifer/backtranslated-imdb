Police Story is an extraordinary series of sets for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and courage. Some of the stunts here are among the best and most dangerous of Jackie, the whole final mall fight is probably the biggest single fighting sequence of Jackie, more brutal and less comical than Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of impact. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately the rest of the film does not stand up to this quality as it is a rather formidable thriller with some comic elements. I always prefer JC in films like Project A, where his natural comic talents shine. In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story, it doesn't work for me. That said, even though this is still there with the best Jackies movies due to the incredible work of the stunts and the sheer show. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong films, we avoid the English version of dubbing as the subtitles are really horrendous. <br /> <br /> Great stunts, the OK movie is a good starting point if you've never seen a JC movie and you deserve a watch for any movie fan 7/10
