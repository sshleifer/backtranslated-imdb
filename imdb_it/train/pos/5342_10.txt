I was deeply moved by this film in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious thing! Such a nice girl. His acting was also superb. Faithful to life and very human. Although I don't like the part where he had to smoke; I hope it was just a fake object. However, it was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. I found myself immersed in history and his character. <br /> <br /> It's pretty interesting how I came to discover this movie. I was walking in the blockbuster and I noticed his beautiful smile on the cover while I was walking. Fortunately I looked in the downward direction that this movie was in! I thought to myself, 'Awe, look at it!' So I took it and saw that this film was described as wonderful things like "A little jewel". I read the plot on the back and then I thought that, well, maybe I would have searched first on IMDb and then come back and rent it later. I'm glad I didn't because I surely would have been lost. After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew I would regret not having rented this movie, so I went back to where I originally found it and shot it. <br /> <br /> I've been on my dresser for a week, since school started for me this week and I really didn't have time to watch it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. I inserted it and it was glued to the beautiful photograph, the delightful soundtrack and the moving plot from beginning to end. I was so fascinated and I have to say that some parts almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to make a special mention for the boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta. It was remarkable. Even the actor who played Carol's father, whose name is unfortunately not present on the site. His voice was so loving and kind that I could really feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not prominent, I really felt his character's presence. <br /> <br /> This is really a wonderful movie. If you are a person moved by light but emotional movies, then this is definitely one for you.
