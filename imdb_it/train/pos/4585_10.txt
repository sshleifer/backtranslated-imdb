This film is the best of Jackie. I still can't get enough of watching some of his best ever stunts. I also like the villains in this movie (the old one looks like a Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike some of Jackie's other works, this film also has a great storyline and I recommend it to all Jackie fans.
