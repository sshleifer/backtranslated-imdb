Yes, I call it a perfect movie. Not a boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly unknown actresses and actors, a great host of characters who are all well defined and with all understandable reasons I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, clear black and white photography, a column perfect sound, an intelligent and harmonious scenography and an engaging and functional story. It is one of those top quality images on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest, the brand that everyone should strive to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing that this actress couldn't do, and she has always been easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterics with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time conveying true feelings. It is fair to add that he has also achieved many interesting parts during his long career, and this is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits this film very well. Regarding desires, human desires, I think everyone can understand. In reality, no one seems intriguing in this film, all the characters act on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact that this often leads to complications makes the dramatic content I won't go into here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this film has to say about young people, about maturity and about the need to compromise. The film that most associates me with this is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, creating a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricature Small Town America. The story bears a certain resemblance to the decidedly harder film by Fritz Lang Clash by Night, made a year earlier, where Stanywck plays a similar part. I can also recommend it.
