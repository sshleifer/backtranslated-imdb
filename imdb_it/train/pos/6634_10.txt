How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit to saying that this film is not very funny but the goal is not to tell you a story, but history! This is the first "real" film in the history of cinema ("le Prince de Galles" was the first, but it wasn't technically perfect enough ??) and undoubtedly has enormous international value. These people you can see end their working day in the film have had the opportunity to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first people to see themselves on the move! And above all the shot is a great shot! And it's very moving when you think of the first people to have seen it! What a moment! Historian of science first (because the Lumi√®re brothers first invented cinema for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie to worship!
