A wanderer looking for work is mistaken for a hitman in a small town in Wyoming, leading to all kinds of complications. Cage is perfectly launched as the unfortunate schmuck who hopes to make a quick dollar and get out of the city, but finding he can't escape the city title. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psychopath known as "Lyle of Dallas", the real killer. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale complete the cast. The screenplay by brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delightful twists and John's direction creates a terrifying "neo noir" atmosphere. Witty and very funny, it sucks the viewer from the beginning and never gives up.
