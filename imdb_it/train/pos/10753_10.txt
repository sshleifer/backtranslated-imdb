To those who say that this film deserves something below the unbridled grace it showed, I disagree. This is a fantastic documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. Please consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage we needed to shoot this film is the most remarkable. We find out that the two brothers separated when that moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing their own and their own safety. To judge whether it is nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or save lives, as those amazing and wonderful firefighters did, it is not my answer. I only know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I submit myself to a full heart 10. That's why the art of shooting was created! To capture the natural emotion that real life offers. You can keep your kung-fu stuff. Romance is nice. The action will never reach this level. This film, September 11th, will be timeless as it has not been glorified. He didn't have a preview. He didn't have all the vain vanities that the lion's share of the many films on so many screens was blabbering. He had class, composure, substance, and he had a recording of the day that changed the modern face of America and even of the world. He talked about inescapable things for the camera's eyes. Please consider this film, as it alone proclaims, a tribute to all those who have fallen because of the beautiful and free name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give something less to a film that shows, does not embellish, the natural courage of real people who act in unreal times. I love "The Godfather" but "9/11" is forever a different kind of film as this is now a different kind of world. It is art without questions or questions. <br /> <br /> jf
