and this is a very disturbing film. I could be wrong, but this is the last film in which I considered Burt Reynolds a real actor, who transformed the role and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are unpretentious and unaware; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. They didn't know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and set designs are realistic and natural. This was before the time of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing in this film is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, rural people continue to hate the people of the city; it's almost a century and a half since the civil war. <br /> <br /> You will like this movie. It was shot in rural sections of South Georgia, which still exist. Just don't go past it to Mobile, Alabama; That area has not yet been repaired by Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
