Samuel Fuller brings his usual playful and elegant direction to this squalid, luscious story and manages to create one of the cinema's gems of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays an insignificant thief (a role that has perfected the course of many films), ripping a wallet of a young woman (Jean Peters) on a New York subway and with it a piece much wanted microfilm. This is 1953, so obviously the microfilm is owned by the Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back. When the girl shows up at the Widmark waterfront shack, sent by a violent boy to claim the film, Widmark realizes the opportunity to shake her and her "companions" for money. The plot thickens, people start to die and Widmark and Peters fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller clumsily manages the love story, but more from a sense of indifference than from bad writing or direction. It is as if it included a love story under duress, and so it made it intentionally incredible, as the love stories so often were and still are in Hollywood movies. Peters gives a remarkable performance like a New Yawk cookie, a part of a gangster and a damsel in distress. When violence occurs against you, we genuinely care about your well-being, and it is typical of Fuller's renegade style, ahead of his style, that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. <br /> <br /> But the final success of "Pickup on South Street" is based on the tired shoulders of the world of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, an exuberant woman who earns money in any way, whether she sells ties or act as a police informer. Ritter gives the performance of his career; in a breathtaking monologue, he transmits without ever directly facing the whole sad trajectory of his character's life, and the despair he feels waking up every morning in a world of struggle, crime and difficulty. It is as if every character that Ritter had ever played converged for a brief moment to give vent to all the emotions that had not been given the chance to let off steam in those other films. The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film and a highlight of the 1950s cinema. <br /> <br /> Vote: A +
