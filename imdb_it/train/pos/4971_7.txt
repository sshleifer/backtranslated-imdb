This is an absurd dark comedy from Belgium. Shot perfectly in sparkling black and white, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is in excellent shape as Roger, the angry and obsessive father of a family in a small and sad Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, together with his young daughter Luise, visits traffic accidents to take pictures. He is also obsessed with winning a car by taking part in a competition where the competitor has to break a record - and decides that his son, Michel, must try to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach for train it. Michel dresses up as Elvis and has a seat on a radio show called "Cinema Lies", in which he describes the mistakes in the movies. Luise is friendly with neighbor Felix, a pigeon fan. Roger is an insensitive figure as he pushes Michel to overcome the limit during the record attempt, which will almost result in his death. Throughout the film, surreal images like Magritte follow one another. It is undeniably fascinating and deserves your time.
