This was a wonderful film. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the actors' performances were great. I had to think about the movie for a long time. I think every student should see this movie so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the film because it was told and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I could be as strong as a woman. I loved it because it told me something about relationships and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, the pianist. If you put these three films together, you have a great vision of what happened during the war. We should always remember something like war.
