I had no idea what this film was until I read about it in the weekly L.A. Generally I agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this movie. the film stars Molly Parker (from my favorite television program Deadwood) and Lukas haas - which I fear we will see more of in the very near future. The film is fun, moving, with great acting and beautiful photography. I don't know if the film is released, but I hope it does - or will - soon. this is meant to be a real indie jewel. even has the music of my favorite band the silver Jews! the only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not present at the screening. even without her there ... this was undoubtedly the best film I saw at the festival.
