Disney may just be something here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on truth that involves sports and a small city in Central America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... yet another story of truth-based sports. <br /> <br /> Both films move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel warm after seeing them. My wife and I got into The Rookie and we expected it to be a nice movie. We were not disappointed when we asked if we would buy this DVD when it comes out, it was a breeze. Definitely.
