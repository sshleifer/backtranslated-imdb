are the highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a girl who becomes a clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the Scottish coast, the villagers live the simple life of "fishermen". My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean landscapes, and the camera work on the boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already one of the biggest stars in 1917 and this film seems to have been written just for her: the unfortunate young woman manages to overcome the misfortune. Pickford's whip whipping lazy villagers to the church is a lot of fun. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. It's not a great Picford movie, but it's still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and he is as good as the boy on the island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I couldn't even see her. My copy intercepts a lot of bells and gongs and adds a strange feeling when the village bells are sounded. Very effective.
