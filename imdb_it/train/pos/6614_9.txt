I read that it wasn't good, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels he has somehow failed. <br /> <br /> I disagree. First of all, it is well executed. Volckman is doing well not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking: would immortality reduce the value of life? Big question ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he's trying to build a feeling, and he's not compromising. This must be applauded. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in this form. I have seen artists reduce a shape to the minimum necessary to build the intensity of a moment. I identify this film with this. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater's roto-scoping, and Volckman's story has more meaning than Linklater's later stories of a life wasted on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. The Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many other stories out there with lots of holes in them that do a lot better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. A really nice job.
