Like Ishtar and King of Comedy, other great misunderstood comedies, Envy has great interpretations from two actors who play essentially, losers (it could be too harsh a word, I'll call them suburban under-achievers). <br /> <br /> This film was a dark gem of comedy, and I'm not sure what people expect. I like to see a studio comedy that isn't full of obvious humor, and I think the little moments of this movie are worth it. The look on Stiller's face when he sees the dog disappear for the first time takes a moment, a time when most people should be able to recognize themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it looked at the root of envy in a really interesting way. There have been many great scenes (the decrepit cabin of Lake J-Man, the ceremonial burial of Corky, the role of Weitz's wife and Walken's J-Man - all extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> I can not stand people who go on IMDb and ruthlessly sweep the movies when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one.I'll take Envy on almost all the top ten comedies of the year (except Napoleon Dynamite.) It's more witty, wackier and an unusual and fun gem. <br /> <br /> Remember this people: most of the time, Popular is not the same as Good.
