On the eighth day God created Georges. But the same of an eighth day does not fit the week, Georges does not fit into the modern world: he has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, returned to an asylum after his mother died four years ago. She was the only one who loved him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man who is no longer loved. His wife left him, for reasons she cannot explain. He also loses the love of his daughters when he arrives too late at the train station to collect the two children, who want to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a highly respected businessman. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he entered a state of crisis, which reaches its climax after the loss of his daughters' love. He questions the meaning of his life, without obtaining definitive results. <br /> <br /> Harry and Georges meet. At first, Harry tries to get rid of Georges, the same as everyone else. But Georges can't be shaken off. And gradually he gets up on Harry, how much he needs Georges, if he wants to overcome his identity crisis. It is Georges who opens a new access to the world for him and which makes him see his life with different eyes. Friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating the quest for success. It's no surprise that Harry can't avoid failing his job now. <br /> <br /> Georges helps Harry regain his daughter's recognition. Even his wife must admit that the fireworks he organized are worth seeing. Nevertheless, reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. And the new turns out to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit, which will come unstoppably to its end. The camera looks at Harry and Georges from above for a long minute while they lie on the grass, savoring the moment. But as this minute will inevitably pass, the friendship of the two men, which was born so wonderfully, will not last long. Georges is destroyed by the impossibility of loving the opposite sex and cannot see any other way out except to commit suicide. Harry turns into a city tramp, asking motorists who are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity. <br /> <br /> The film describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism that devours positive values ​​such as human friendliness or friendship. It is Georges, the Mongol, who seems to be able to show the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his request ends badly. However, its failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or undesirable to achieve the intended goal. The way he shows us is surely passable, even if it requires a great deal of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical anti-conformism.
