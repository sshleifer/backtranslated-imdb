/ * slight spoiler * / <br /> <br /> Go back, before Evangelion was done, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and a familiar name for many anime fans, and before Gainax reached fanfighting status , Gunbuster was created. With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon or course shorts, Gunbuster had some difficult actions to follow. It was not easier to choose a genre already done countless times before, space opera. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax has decided to put it out as an OAV in six parts (direct on video) series. This allows the series to have a wider range than would have been possible if it had been turned into a film. This also prevents it from becoming too dull and too long, with many unnecessary and filling battles along the way. In addition, they have made an effort to stay away from the proven spatial mechanisms used in Macross or Gundam and in many other popular space works. <br /> <br /> For one, the shows start pretty lightly, with Noriko in the Okinawan high school for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a child. This makes his life at the Academy rather difficult, as some of his classmates begin to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is practically a dramatic comedy, with particular attention to the characters and the setting of the school. Things change rapidly when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in the class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet. <br /> <br /> The central part of Gunbuster leaves our female protagonist in space, focusing on personal drama and action. A couple of characters are introduced and parts of Noriko's past are dragged again. Beyond that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunner, humanity's last hope, is presented. As clever as the writer Okada, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to revive things a little. In short, time moves more slowly for those traveling at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Even the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged far more than her. Science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a fairly credible way, with even some short films from the SD science theater between episodes, in which Noriko, Kazumi and their coach provide a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. /> <br /> The animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. The designs are in retro 80s style, but it has its charm. The animation is quite fluent and the character's design is nice, even if the costumes betray <br /> <br /> part of the charm of the fans that Gainax will later use to the fullest. Even the mecha of all the shows are really fantastic, with the Gunbuster as the last machine to kill, strong and vast. The last episode was entirely made in black and white. Although it is generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it gives a completely different atmosphere to the series, which is perfectly suited to the second part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very typical space proud of the opera. Too explosive in places, very generic, and certainly not worth buying. It largely fits the series, but sometimes it can get quite annoying. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other highly respected series he has worked on is Dragon Half. If you think about the music of the 80s, you will know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, attention moves slowly from the drama to the space opera to the epic battle, but in this way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama will be attenuated, and the battles will take the first row. However, neither aspect is ever left completely out. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and the crew are fighting for the further existence of human beings, and with the last battle in sight, some questions are presented to the public, regarding the position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. Even if they will never be answered later, they will still present some interesting points for reflection. The last episode is very epic, with a pleasant but fairly predictable ending, although not all endings should contain numerous bizarre twists, of course. Once again, it fits the series. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may seem like your space space anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles and some personal drama, and for the most part, it is. But it is exceptionally well done for a change. Instead of looking for a constant mix of previous elements, six long episodes, Gunbuster offers us a transition from small-scale drama to large-scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet some interesting and well-made characters, whose mutual relationships heavily change due to the phenomenon of time dilation. The show is written very tightly, although it tends to slip in some places. Excessively dramatic occasions and attacks of too aggressive mecha could have been easily avoided. Overall, the journey in which Gunbuster takes you is very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. He may not have broken the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least he bent them a little. Classic anime very funny, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
