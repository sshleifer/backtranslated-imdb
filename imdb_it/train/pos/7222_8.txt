Surely one of the most witty and twisted dunnit I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine were brilliant and they got me through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The very classy scenic elements and props lend a sense of atmosphere to the process. The minimalist atmosphere works for the whole image. <br /> <br /> My only problem is not the movie itself, but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the DVD movie. I own the full-screen version (which shows that I love the movie enough to take the full-screen presentation) but a fantastic Deluxe or "special" edition would surely get my money.
