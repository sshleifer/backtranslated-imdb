Being a native of Bolton, this film has an obvious charm for me. The location shots are fascinating and show a Bolton very in transition - there are many scenes of apparent neglect but this serves to show the reconstruction of the city - and the idea that the old must make room for the new is right in the heart of this film . James Mason, a bit uncomfortable, leads a fun ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that turns into a full-blown generational conflict, then a pleasantly Schmaltzian resolution. Although I am a little too young to remember it fully, the minutiae of Lancashire life in the 1960s are all here: cashing Friday, songs around the piano, constitutional Sunday, good neighborliness, courtship trepidations, massive importance of self-respect, and I was pleased to see Naughton's funniest lines left intact. There is no doubt that this film should be made available on DVD - it is well made and most of the performances are well done.
