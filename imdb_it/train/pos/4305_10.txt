The Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is an absolutely unique urban piece, in which the entire plot is not able to communicate much. <br /> <br /> The central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty that life holds for people of every race, background and station. But to proclaim that the theme of the film would be to minimize its reach horribly. In the same way, it is useless to put it in a particular genus. <br /> <br /> The film has volumes to say, although probably different volumes for each viewer, and it says everything in such a little predicate way from so many points of view, that in the end, I can't even define the his central message to myself. <br /> <br /> However, he does business with such laser precision; every scene object, line of dialogue and background music bar that contribute to its pervasive mood and powerful message, which I am pleasantly surprised and come away very caring after each viewing. It still doesn't feel stifling at all. A sparkling film with an exceptional cast and everything works.
