I just found it on DVD and watched it again. I love bright colors and dark images. He's not a big Beatty fan, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is stunning, as always, and well, this film marked the time when Madonna was her sexiest ever. I wish it had stayed with the "breathless" look for a while yet. The first really important role of Charlie Korsmo, besides "What about bob?" The effects of makeup were cutting edge and continue to hold out for the most part. Beautiful landscapes and atmosphere transport you directly to a comic-book environment. The machines, the closet, the buildings and even the street lamps are a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, even if the scenes with a lot of red can annoy a little, since it tends to fade a little. I just wish Beatty had the chance to make a sequel. All in all, a few hours of fun.
