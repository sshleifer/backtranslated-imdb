Holding aside all political opinions, "Gandhi, my father" by Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor is a good film that cleverly explores the confused-family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the struggle of his firstborn Harilal Gandhi with the company, his greatest father in life and, above all, demons in his head. One draws parallels to Gandhi, the father of the nation, and struggles that every child could have with his father. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in this order - add color and pathos to this harrowing tale of Harilal who cries to be hugged only once and runs away even at the slightest touch of her finger. <br /> <br /> Feroz Khan's direction and production canvas are sumptuous and attractive, however, the script could have been narrower. I had seen the play a few years ago on a pirated video DVD (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and it was certainly more compelling. However, the soundtrack of the film and the father-son and mother-son moments are just a fantastic gift. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been fantastic. It is borderline to that. It has the potential so enormous that it is just a difference between a father and a son or just Gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect an absolute harmony of emotions, nothing comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Compare decently with other Gandhi. Certainly not a synthetic film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract like Hey Ram by Kamal Hassan. The film almost manages to find its foundation; however, one is left asking "what if ..." is worth watching. 7.5 / 10
