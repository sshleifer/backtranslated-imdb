* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is only the second pay-per-view I gave a perfect 10, the first being the 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, just fun disposable. And that's why I like it. <br /> <br /> The opening meeting between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga and Marty Jannetty were the only low points. They were OK, but DiBiase deserved better in his last pay-per-view game. These days, a game like this would have run-ins and a bigger climax for Razor's first big babyface push. And Jannetty, fresh from a race for the Intercontinental title, could have done better with Borga. But I don't think anyone really cared. They just needed a Borga push on pay TV. <br /> <br /> IRS and The Kid were fantastic, as were Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels doesn't care about anyone. Notice how, soon after, he left the WWF for not having to work with Razor. Bret Hart has had two big fights with Doink (note that the best match of all is against the Hit-man) and then Lawler. Their rivalry was a classic; that's why Feud of the Year that year was child's play. How often do you see two legends win over Feud of the Year late in their careers? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year. Who knew the Bodies could resist against one of the best teams ever? <br /> <br /> Many say the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF great (as in, pre-WWE) was the mix of athleticism and freak show. Is there a soul out there who didn't like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, even if the game status of the year has never occurred. They put Lex Luger well, but they made a wise choice in having Yokozuna keep the belt. It was the first heel since Superstar Graham held the belt for more than two months. Today heels are champions at all times. But from the beginning of the WWWF up to the WWF of the 90s, if you blinked you lost the heel realm. <br /> <br /> Being an old school wrestling enthusiast, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
