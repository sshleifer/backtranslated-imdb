The comparison with Sleuth, the first transformed theatrical film, is obvious and at my first vision I thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repeated views of Sleuth. <Br /> <br /> I purchased Deathrap in the jar of business at Wal-Mart, imagining it had Caine and the underrated Reeve and it was worth 6 dollars. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could have collected. <br /> <br /> It is one of those best kept secrets that movie fans are always happy to discover. And it is absolutely worth repeating them. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine performed bold performances at Sleuth, I was doubly impressed by Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightly associated with his now legendary portrait of Superman, stole the show in what should have been a performance worthy of the Oscars. I always thought that Reeve was a cast of type that didn't have many chances to shine outside of the Superman movies and other imperfect but fun movies like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows that its potential was really tapped and put in operation, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> Absolutely enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine. He was casual, delightfully manipulative and sadistic. And seeing him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was a real pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this film that I entered a "Michael Caine phase" and started renting as many things as possible. <br /> <br /> As for Deathtrap, there is enough juicy dialogue here to fill in his "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue would ruin the immensely fun plot). <br /> <br /> It's really, really hard to talk about the movie without ruining important points in the plot that are infinitely more fun to discover for yourself. Needless to say, it's a must see. But for me, it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated views are a must. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to sit next to Sleuth on your DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this wonderfully written quote from the movie: "I wonder if it wouldn't do ... well ... just a little starry look of me to get into a collaboration so risky and exciting. .. where I could not count on any moral obligation ... whatsoever.
