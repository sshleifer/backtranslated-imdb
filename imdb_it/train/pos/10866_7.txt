Johnnie To's ELECTION has some interesting music on the opening credits and also a nice opening title project, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters who solemnly swear an oath or utter something sacred; in fact the whole film is well marked. I found A from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and couldn't wait to see a movie To. What I started with, ELECTION, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent by today's moderately and essentially violent standards; the story of an Asian godfather's drawing, he uses a game of puzzle elements, violent facts about the lives of the mafia, the race for the scepter, real details, and as with Coppola he is expected to believe that some of the morally glamorous mafiosi are entitled nice and friendly. The performances are reasonably fun and colorful. <br /> <br /> THE ELECTION is well done in the pleasant and somewhat careless style of the Hong Kong fare; the finish is bitter, true, straight and will frighten children.
