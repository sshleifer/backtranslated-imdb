My family and I have seen this film often over the years. It is clean, healthy, excruciating and moving. Showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles away and the strangest of coincidences, it's almost as if the hand of God were to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5-year-old Jodelle Micah Ferland playing Desi the big-hearted girl does a wonderful job of playing her part, and for me it was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> All in all, a 10 out of 10. There are no negative aspects to this sweet human story. Children of all ages will be in tears, so they will look with joy and this will bring the vision family together with smiles and good feelings.
