Of life in (some) colleges. Obviously there have been artistic licenses, but some of the ones you've seen in this movie go on in some universities. <br /> <br /> I went to colleges in Southern California, where the races are practically around with theirs. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc. And I can honestly say it's there. But the fact is that when the class gets out, or when they're just waiting for the lesson, they (the students) just seem to be hanging around with people of their own race or ethnicity. Is it that bad? Not exactly. Everyone needs a feeling of belonging. But like the school newspaper of one of the schools I attended once I wrote about this, "we should all try to attend students of other ethnicities and try to get to know them". Otherwise you are creating your segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended. Once someone put leaflets around the campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie in which the young Caucasian came down and started shooting at a multicultural gathering. I can only hope and pray that nothing like this ever happens. <Br /> <br /> So "Higher Learning" is too dramatic? Exaggerated? Could be. Is it "off mark"? It depends on where you went or you go to school. The thing of the race in which the ethnic groups move around with their own happenings. Apart from Hollywood exaggerations, the racing thing struck me very close to home.
