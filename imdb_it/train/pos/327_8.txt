I read a comment that labeled this film "trash" and "a waste of time". I think this person took his political underpants a little too much. <br /> <br /> I have just rented the new Criterion DVDs of both Yellow and Blue. <br /> <br /> These films - though not quite fantastic - have at least become of historical interest as far as the so-called "political-social <br /> radical student movement" of the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> I had not seen any of the two images and from their infamous reputation, I was expecting a real porn (there is none.) There is a frontal <br /> <br /> nudity (including the male frontal nudity still verboten (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - the Orwellian-X) in the United States But I did not expect the films <br /> <br /> democratic socialist message in the face. <br /> <br /> Even if it tends to be simplistic, I thought it was done occasionally <br /> <br /> its points well. Both both films had me laughing out loud <br /> <br / > and the director's comment made it clear that there was a lot of parody of <br /> <br /> in the film: osedly "pornographic" sex scenes <br /> <br /> The first scene of this kind is very realistic The first pair is clumsy, inept, funny and engaging in their first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> The second - which caused the most complaints - falsified < br /> <br /> c unnilingus and fellatio. And the last one is the end of an angry fight, <br /> <br /> credible. <br /> <br /> The extras include an informative introduction to the film, an <br /> <br /> interview with the original American distributor and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> excerpts from testimonials in the United States and a director's "diary" comment <br /> on some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the film that "blue noses" do not let slip and led to <br /> <br /> "itchy interest without any social redemption value" standard <br /> < br /> which, fortunately, still resists. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in the vagaries of history will find this a must <br /> <br /> see.
