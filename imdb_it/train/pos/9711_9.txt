Well, I just found out that there's a more disgusting and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick English comedy about the most horrible, crazy and disgusting town in the whole of the United Kingdom. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") look normal !! The format of the show is very similar to LITTLE Britain, except that everything revolves around the inhabitants of this unique city of hell. Both shows always feature the same scenes, each episode and some obviously inspired by the "Little Britain" (in particular the work in search of classy scenes). But the show is different because although it is as rough as "Little Britain" (so it is not a show for children), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that distinguishes it from all these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you haven't guessed it, this is NOT a show for children, people easily offended or normal and this is probably why I liked it. However, you really need very thick skin and love for the horrible to make the most of it. Funny and incredibly irreverent beyond imagination - you have to see it to believe it.
