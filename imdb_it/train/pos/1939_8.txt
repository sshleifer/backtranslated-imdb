I don't know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a strange title and from the description it looks like something else. Sometimes it's nice to try a movie that is slightly different from the mainstream Hollywood / thriller episode and this film was definitely different. From the beginning this film intrigued me but I couldn't understand why until the end of the film, when I realized that the film was fantastic because the characters were so real. I thought acting was superb and character development really makes you interested in them and I hope that in the end things will go well for them. I think that anyone who looks at the film can somehow relate to one of the characters and this makes the vision pleasant and some good laughs for the pure ordinariness of the actors. <br /> <br /> At the peak of the film you will surely get a sense of well-being and stay with the kind of feeling that things will go well. I'm sure this will have a wide appeal and should be given a chance.
