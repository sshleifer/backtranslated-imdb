I just saw the movie for the third time and I loved Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just like before. It continues to improve more and more. You simply have to admire the carefully measured way of speaking, the slow deliberate action, everything exactly in its place. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the greatest and certainly my all-time favorite !!!
