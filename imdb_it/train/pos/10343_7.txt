The film "Amazing Mr. Williams" features the participation of Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who ALSO did five films that year, THREE of which they did together! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams, and he and his companions are presented with a corpse, and they must understand what really happened. The spectators will recognize his collaborators - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always held positions of authority ... senators, presidents of banks, policemen. This dunnit has a touch of comedy, the cops are always punching each other, and Williams and his girlfriend are also fighting verbally. Some funny gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested along a date with his girlfriend. There are a lot of fun things here, so go beyond the slow start and wait for the funniest things ahead. I don't want to give away spoilers, so you'll have to take it on Turner Classic Movies. The director Alexander Hall mostly made comedies and, apparently, he was engaged to Lucy.
