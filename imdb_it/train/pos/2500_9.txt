... probably would be the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). besides a big fan of fan service for fan girls (well, it was redundant ~), it was the story that upset me. cheers Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people won't agree with me on this, but he wasn't one of the three main actors (the guys who played Sho, son and Kei) who gave the best performance (for me, anyway). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy number 5 of the battle Royale! <br /> <br /> don't get me wrong, I like Hyde, I love his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came out a little, but I liked that scene where he danced with the body of the dead kills the other boys. and Gackt wasn't so bad, I preferred his character to be far enough from the start. I can't say much about my background on Lee-Hom Wang, I won't pretend to know him, but he brought his weight with the star cast. <br /> <br /> this film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). while the complete song takes about nine minutes, you won't notice the length because you would like to hear Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> in any case, this film is a must not only for fans (a huge fan base ~) but for those who love futuristic and science-fiction movies, in Asian style.
