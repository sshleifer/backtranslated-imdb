Watching it several times as a child was an experience about 15 years ago, and now that I have found it it still has a cinematic experience like few others. If it's risky, it's a great show of morals and recommended life lessons for family observation with young children. While still an adult, I was lucky enough to have learned many times over the years. Trying to find it today is quite difficult. . . but believe me, it's worth it, no matter what the age. Anime fans in particular will find this a great contribution to Masami Hata's filmography. With impressive works of art and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a precious experience. While some of the lyric songs are not so hot when recorded in English, the soundtrack is still catchy. But even vocal acting is far better than it was released today. Unfortunately he went out of print in the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video and, as far as I know, he received no new format, at least in the United States. Look for it and you will be quite satisfied! It is an artistic, intense, fun and important point of reference in Japanese animation.
