This film is an extraordinary piece that will convince even the most skeptical spectator that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the last 50 years. His foolish performance, entertains, disgusts and enchants as you leave you breathless. This film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very crude, but he is still able to convey the mastery of Depardieu. A must for all Depardieu fans and by far his best first job.
