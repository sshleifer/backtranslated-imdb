The film is extremely entertaining with an exceptional cast and the excellent direction of James Eves. The film is fun with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and all are perfectly expressed. James Eves has a good eye for casting and conducts like a conductor knowing exactly when to raise the action, fall and then rise to the climax. He does it with an element of humor, a lot of twists, chills and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie, with a lot of blood, blood and screams. The film runs at great speed and the characters take you on a terrifying adventure, but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with a lot of irony and action. Great!
