Citizen X tells the real-life drama of the search for a serial killer nicknamed "The Rostov Ripper". This great film shows the long journey it took to try to catch a killer. The film shows how politics could have helped the killer continue his fury for over 12 years. (Probably over 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as principal detective and Donald Sutherland as lead of the general investigation were superb. Jeffrey DeMunn in the role of the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the kind of movie that will hypnotize you and immediately put you on the net in search of the real case. This is a movie not to be missed. I made my HBO debut and never had a film version for my understanding. Great movie
