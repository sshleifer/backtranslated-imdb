Breaking Glass is a film that all those who aspire to enter the music industry should see more than once. It's a very obscure story about how a record company manipulates a singer to do things his way and get as much money out of her. Watching some of the current "star-seeking" TV shows both in the UK and abroad, I am always reminded of this film. Although they are not experts in the field, the winners of these shows tend to have a great initial success and then their descent from there. This film predates these shows even if the effect seems the same. After getting rid of his manager, played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels, slowly but surely the record company changes his lyrics and puts it on stimulants and is finally completely destroyed. Six potential stars of tomorrow .... WATCH THIS AND WATCH !!!
