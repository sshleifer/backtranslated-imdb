Steve Carell had his first starring role in the 40-year-old virgin, having had only secondary roles in films like Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman and his work on the Daily Show, we had just a little taste of the comedy that Carell really makes her . You can say that Will Ferrell influenced his "comedy air", but Carell takes him to another level, all he does is innocent, lovable and funny. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin is two hours of non-stop laughter (or 4 hours if you see her twice as I did), a perfect supporting cast and great leads enchant the audience through the entire movie. The script was perfect with so many big lines that you would like to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music is perfect for the tone of the film, and you can tell the director that he knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with jokes about sex, a bit of nudity and a lot of language, this film is not for everyone, but if you liked the Wedding Crashers, the Anchor or any movie along those lines , you will absolutely love The 40 Year Old Virgin.
