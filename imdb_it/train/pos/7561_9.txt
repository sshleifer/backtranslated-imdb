The version I saw of this film was the rental of Blockbuster with a similar title, but a dirty word in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun to die for. It was also true for the bone. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or the surrounding area, you'll understand humor. Otherwise, you may not have understood it at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the industry who struggle to make it until they reach a breaking point is a rare gem. He says it's a drama, but it's a drama as much as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to keep up with his good. His performance is particularly impressive during the poodle scene. The only negative was Carmen Electra but we can't have everything.
