This film is wonderful. It always has always been. I'm really bad, it's better than a maid who falls in love. Walt really off himself here. And the music! A dream is a desire that your heart makes beautiful! What else can you say besides formidable! I can't wait for the special edition to arrive, it will be fantastic! I can't wait to hear all the deleted songs! This film is made so beautiful and intelligent! It's adorable. What about even nice mice! I know I always repeat the same things, but hey this is a great movie! Woods was exceptional in this beautiful beautiful movie BEAUTIFUL
