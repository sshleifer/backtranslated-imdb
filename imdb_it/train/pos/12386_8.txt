'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror films already made in the film industry! I think it's very scary as very few films really are. Alison Parker is a model with a certain reputation. She went out with a lawyer named Michael Lerman and has another model called Jennifer as her best friend. Everything was beautiful in his life, until he decided to live alone for a while and rent a beautiful old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is its neighbors, who are very, VERY strange. Suddenly Alison starts having health problems and faints frequently; Also remember some painful facts about her past that make her have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and has to do with the new home that lives ... <br /> <br /> Personally I find "The Sentinel" a very disturbing film, and together with "The Exorcist" "They are two of the scariest movies I've seen before, when we find out that Alison's house is occupied only by the priest and alone, my blood is frozen! sentry to keep monsters from our world.
