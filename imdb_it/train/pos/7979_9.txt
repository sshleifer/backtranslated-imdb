Tony Scott can make good and bad films, I personally think he can be a little flashy and trash and his work obviously suffers in comparison to that of his rather famous brother, but this is probably his best film. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so exceptional is that Scott gives Denzel (in burning form, better than Training Day) and the revelation that it's Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of true warmth and tenderness. Set up is NOT absolutely boring, even if it takes time - it's addictive, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. All this serves to make the action much more effective, since we are so invested in the characters, despite all their obvious weaknesses. This film has brought you to the limit for its entirety, and at the same time it is not excluded. <br /> <br /> The film obviously would be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have so many duff roles, when he's quite as good as almost all the main characters out there (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power on the screen these days). This film should have been huge, given its status and the strength of its performance, and the quality of the film. This shows that if a studio does not support a film to the end, it ends up going directly to the video. I wish I had the chance to see it on the big screen.
