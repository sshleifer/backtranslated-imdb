There have been many film and television productions of Jane Eyre, each with aspects to recommend, but I suspect this is what people will continue to discover and fall in love with for decades to come. It's just a classic (and offers so much more than the history of others). Timothy Dalton is absolutely in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the brand; his performance is surprisingly agile and colorful, without ever straying too far from the obscure complexities of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but perfect for Dalton (who, appropriately, dominates her!) The nuances of her performance emerge better in a second vision (once the shock of Dalton's charisma is absorbed). There are some technical flaws and a couple of times when production values ​​could have been better; although this was practically a top-of-the-range production according to the BBC standards of that time. But it's the benefits that are the real pleasure. Don't miss this!
