I admit to being a little tired of the film genre of a child that softens the heart of his reluctant guardian. Have I seen enough ?? Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider ?? expect to be bored by the formula. What caught my attention in The King of Masks was the sadness of the scenography: the China of small towns in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm and girls were considered so useless for poor parents who killed them at birth or gave them to anyone who took them to the black market. When Wang discovers that the nephew he bought, who has nicknamed "Doggie", is a niece, initially the spear, although he has shown great promises as heir who plays the road. Even after reluctantly releasing his back, he is not too upset when he is abducted. The film is therefore gritty, showing the lengths to which a cunning young girl had to survive in that society. <br /> <br /> The two main interpretations are credible and seductive in their social context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment on Wang's part for not having achieved more material success. Wang fully accepts his position as a celebrated artist with low social status, even though I did too. While Cagnolino exhibits a level of precocity and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely credible in the context of a child constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls as garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> The peek into the life of a small town in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two protagonists, the actors, the surprising twists and of course the moving resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.
