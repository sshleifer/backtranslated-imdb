Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while maintaining his characteristic and idiosyncratic style. Merging is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached it with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties have impressed critics and the public with their unique style and dialogue. The director's previous films featured colorful characters and offered close-up observations of life - often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York itself - that were unusual and insightful. <br /> <br /> My initial focus was on the description of this film as an "espionage thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to create a well-defined style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than you can imagine. Hartley's film preserves the dialogue and attention to character that are its brands, along with a singular cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Furthermore it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been favored by dark elements on all sides. Hartley brought all his abilities to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. He is actually entering his own. The cast does a great job interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see it in full bloom here, still with us and more mature and gorgeous than before.
