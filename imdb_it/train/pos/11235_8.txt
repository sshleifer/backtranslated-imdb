Well done, and together with "New Trips" it's a great continuation! Fabulous to see James Cawley in the last episode "Vigil" Take a look! <br /> <br /> I like the increasing characterization and I think we have good substitutions for TV actors in a fan-produced piece. This show manages to capture the feeling quite well, as they claim on the ste, has improved over the years with experience and I hope with some more experience, a strong script editor, and a pick-up in timing and CGI that HF ​​will make more remarkable than it really is already! <br /> <br /> Good work to all interested parties! <br /> <br /> (I have a HUGE soft spot for Lefler & McFarland (BIG acting), though I'm a little tired of the "Lefler laws". Well already! Shelby is great (though a little tense) and it's nice that he took the ship Commodore Ian is cute (like Fred Flintstone), but he doesn't have the gritty side of an officer in command and seems too pleased with himself: Doc, Counselor and Rawlins are right on the money to my eyes, as is the WONDERFUL Nechayev (what a nice accent - a real Russian! (Well, I guess Rene is from the Rep of the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> He takes my vote, and CGI is kewl. Some of the greenscreen is obvious, but with a limited budget whaddayagonndo? <br /> <br /> Really happy with me und it! <br /> <br /> (OK, some of the performances are not great but they are fan-made and therefore it is possible that they are variable - sorry Cmm Cole) <br /> <br /> The gay material is too thick (Graham Norton is embarrassed.) Trek does not pay much attention to the tiles and straight, so why mark gays with everyone snogging? It is not necessary to show someone's sexuality up to this point - I hope they die and let Aster & Zen not be people who are not pawns - I will not treat my gay friends differently, they are just normal boys. <br /> Musically it is a mixed bag. I can tell everything that is in Trek OST stock and most of the time it works, but times can collapse now and then (the end of "Worst Fears Part 2" is missing the creaking and editing. This "music! < br /> <br /> I can't wait any longer !! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, never surreal!" <br /> <br /> Viva les frontieres
