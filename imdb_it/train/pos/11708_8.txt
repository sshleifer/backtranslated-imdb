The reason people say this movie scared them is because they did it !! This means that the purpose of the film has been heard by some who have seen it. When I saw this film for the first time it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a bloodthirsty and scary movie, but the kind that you might think is possible that things happen the way the film was written. Obviously, non-believers will say that it's just a science fiction movie. The truth is that this film is a must for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious vision. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), this is one of them and it's a must. I've never seen the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I think it picks up where this film ends.
