This is the best (so far) version you'll see and the truest version for Bronte's work. Dalton is a bit difficult to imagine as Rochester, which Jane Eyre has declared "not beautiful". But his acting goes beyond this and Zelah Clark, as pretty as she is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch but it's worth it. Almost direct quotations of the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature, this is the way to see it. I own all the copies of this film and have read and re-read the original. The shooting may seem a little dated now, but there will never be so again.
