The Secret Fury, in many ways a romantic drama of suspense (directed by Mel Ferrer) boasts leading characters in Colbert and Ryan; it remains disconcerting if not sufficiently compelling until the end, when implausibility conquers the suspension of disbelief - as often happens in this genre. But for some viewers the highlight of the film will be the portrait of Blowy Leah by Vivian Vance - the immortal Ethel Mertz in "I Love Lucy". Oddly, Vance had very few film roles; his real home was Broadway, where (among other concerts) he played for Ethel Merman. Here it contributes to a winning turn as a maid subjected to a minor role in a nefarious scheme; look at her with little enthusiasm trying to clear the smoke when she is blowing a furtive cigarette into the closet of the hotel linen - a transgression for which she finally pays the supreme penalty.
