This was a hit in the South By Southwest (SXSW) Austin Film Festival last year, and features a beautiful cast directed by Gloria Reuben of E.R., and John Glover, a mammoth scenario. Although filmed on a small budget in New York, the film looks fabulous and takes us behind the scenes through rehearsing and editing what the actors call "The Scottish Play", as a reference to the word "Macbeth" and thought to bring the ancient curse of the drama. The theater company exhibits all the excitement of the game itself, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and even a little fun. Games begin when an established actor is replaced (in the lead role) by a well-known "handsome face" from the television soap opera scene to attract larger crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there and the drama takes place in a pleasant way. Excellent soundtrack and good performance throughout. The DVD also includes the director's comment and some deleted scenes.
