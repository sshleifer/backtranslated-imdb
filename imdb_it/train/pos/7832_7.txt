In the end I had my desire to see this in a cinema. I saw Fritz Lang's film on video a few years ago. I was hoping that the ideal conditions for screening would work perfectly. <br /> <br /> The conditions were ideal at the Ontario Cinematheque. Full length intact print. Intertitles in the original German Gothic script with simultaneous translation in English, accurate without being too literal. Live accompaniment to the Ideal piano. <br /> <br /> The magic of the film splattered for a while but in the end it failed to capture, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This movie has no real connection to the Wagner's Ring cycle as I already knew but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th c. Niebelungenlied for his own purposes. The first part of Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - has much that will be familiar to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried Kriemhild's wife, his marriage to King Etzel (Attila) the Hun, and his desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, renamed Nibelungs, for Siegfried's murder. The spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded into the Wagnerian myth in his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This film remains tied to the land. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is spectacular. The imposing sets rival those of "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration establishes a new point of reference in the barbaric splendor. There is a huge cast of scarred and mangy Huns and Art Deco Burgunds. And battles. Battles that never seem to end in fact. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in his revenge plan. He manages to destroy everything around her. His loyalty to his martyr Sigfrido does not seem to derive so much from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted: "Unsex me here." He knew he was emotionally unprepared for what he had to do. But Kriemhild does not show normal human emotions, and certainly nothing identifies with the feminine principle. It is already "full of the most cruel cruelty", to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director tell this with glower. I don't want to exaggerate, but that glower is practically the only expression of all time to "animate" Kriemhild's face. It is the maximum in terms of performance with a single note. It is clearly intentional, however, not simply a case of poor acting. <br /> <br /> What we have for sale is a one-dimensional sketch of an avenging Fury. Some might see Kriemhild as a potent heroine. I see the film only as a misogynist.
