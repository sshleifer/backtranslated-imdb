"The Good Earth" is a great film that is no longer heard of. There are a lot of great disasters and events, but it's also a non-passionate love story. All this happens in just over two hours, which is short by today's standards. The special effects and costumes are very good for the period of time. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role. Basically it has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and broken. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are fantastic. <br /> <br />
