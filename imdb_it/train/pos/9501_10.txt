I had seen this movie when it was released, and when I was 12 :) And I still vividly remember the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escapes every time when faced with danger :) And the best feature of the film was the portrayal of the villain ! I think many so-called action movies have copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not only does it never impress me when I see such a copy, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors performed wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of the black and white chemistry of the hero and heroin was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed in them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make children understand the value of true love, sacrifice and care . I recommend that every person see this film when given a chance !! --Vijay.
