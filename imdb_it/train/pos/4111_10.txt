I saw this film for the first time as a pre-adolescent, about the age at which children start thinking through their identity. I was very influenced by the scene of the man and the children that he raises as his own. The eldest was mocked by the fact that his mother is a prostitute and none of his brothers has the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes obvious by having children that seem nothing to each other). The man continues to persuade the boy who is their father from the only definition that counts. The man is acclaimed as a father by all the children except one, who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the cartoons is also compelling for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not Kurosawa's biggest movie.
