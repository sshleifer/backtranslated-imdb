This is a British comedy film with strong resonances and one that I could look to infinity without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his dry humor but a very intelligent general plan. Karl Malden has always been a fan of mine since he starred in "Streets of San Francisco". I think Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie, but she seems to be so incapable of everything she tries to do but in reality she is so active, especially at the end when she tells everyone she's invested so much money that she discovered while she was washing his clothes. One thing concerns me though, could anyone tell me why I can't buy it on DVD or VHS in the UK, could anyone help?
