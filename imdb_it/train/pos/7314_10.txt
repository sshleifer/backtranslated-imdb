The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first. I was expecting a gore fest, but instead I saw a very clever killer mess with a head on a chilling soundtrack (actually it's my ringtone at the moment: P). The fact that I couldn't predict when he would kill and when he disappeared was an important advantage in my book. Predictable horror films bore me. Now, I know the plot had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie is finished and you're in bed dragging the fact that you just witnessed a moving masterpiece. Finally, as I said, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my favorite theater scores of all time, so I was very happy to know that Rob Zombie left it intact in his remake. About the remake, I read a very complete article and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie worshiped John Carpenter, I have high hopes for his interpretation of this classic. This movie is perfect for every moment you feel like a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, the opening, the ending, you'll name it for the All Hallow's Eve marathon. :)
