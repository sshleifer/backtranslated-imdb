Richard Widmark is a contaminated character in this film. He is a professional pickpocket. He was in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is as amazing as the Widmark flamed girl. <br /> <br /> This is a period piece during the McCarthy era in which the Red Scare ruled politics and worked quite well in this plot. The unusual thing about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings at a time when women rarely were more than sex objects in movies. This is what makes this film noir as women often have different roles in this type of film. <br /> <br /> The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as a subtitle for double feature films in the theater. The sets show that it is a limited-budget film. The script drove J Edgar Hoover crazy because patriotism has little to do. Hoover wanted it changed. <br /> <br /> Instead, it became a B under image of paper that was a success in 1953. The script and the acting in it are better than other great features of the same year.
