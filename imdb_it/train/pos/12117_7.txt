Although this film has put Davis on the map because of his brilliant and intense performance as the ill-gotten beggar / prostitute Rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfactory for me as a whole. Acting is really satisfying in most cases. What I cannot understand for the life of me is just how or why Phillip, a sensitive and well-educated young man, would suffer the constant abuses that this vagabond constantly channels towards him: I find his naive tolerance quite incredibly incredible in some respects. Yes, I know he is a sensitive and introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that nobody who cultivates tolerates his attitude or actions and makes it credible. Davis is staggering in her role: yes, from time to time she can exaggerate in her histrionics, but it is a vividly creative representation of how she is looked at. Too bad he wasn't playing a gangster's moll. His character would have been completely believable as a vagabond in the slums!
