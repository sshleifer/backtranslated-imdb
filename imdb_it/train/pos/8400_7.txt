I chose this film in my local library. Having met the director at a film festival late last year, I was curious to "control" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film examines family aspects, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. It can be a little "talking" at times, but never so much as to completely sink the film. I enjoyed watching a love story with characters that CLEARLY belong together and watch them make informed decisions rather than falling "haphazardly" into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this film and the medium-low budget shooting on a black film is quite distinct. Check it out. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine. Good stuff!
