Anyone who doesn't think Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs to be controlled. Somehow he manages to be both completely alienated and brainless, but at the same time terrifying, wise and intelligent. One of those rare films that actually improves its predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Among the highlights not to be missed is the duel with death and the ending, which is highly "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all the Matrix garbage and start doing what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
