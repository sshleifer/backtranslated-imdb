This fantastic Marvel superhero game is a real tribute while remaining true to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so weak with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, Spiderman does whatever a spider can do. It does more than turn the nets. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When not using the net in combat, he also punches and kicks. Spidey has his hands full while fighting Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most levels are challenging, but some require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. Better luck in "Spiderman 2." My rating: 9 out of 10.
