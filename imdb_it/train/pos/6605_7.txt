2054. Paris is a drawing by Escher with people and vehicles that run at different levels in an obvious homage to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is both ultra-modern and crumbling. And in the blink of an eye among the surveillance sweeps, a young medical researcher is kidnapped right after leaving her sister in a sleazy nightclub. A tough police captain investigates. Shown in black and white, with dark corridors, shady alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard-boiled film noir, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller, since high-tech surveillance, invisible suits and ruthless super-corporations are part of the landscape as much as guns and cars. The film never generates the mad atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its marginal tech-heavy characters clashing with industrial types of corporations that seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer certainly feels that the future Paris is no Utopia and the science of the future are less than benevolent. And as the police procedural story unfolds, we are brought into the darkest recesses of individual ambitions beneath the glossy patina of the cultivated PR image of Avalon Corporation. The motion capture process used here produces a glimpse of black and white comics and the new generation rotoscoping, and is captivating or intrusive according to your tastes. However, a great visual sense is exhibited here, and the future Paris is full of tiny details that give the image a unique appearance, in turn Spartan and Baroque. It's worth a look.
