SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just saw the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would like them to have left the original version on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The Portabello Road could have been reduced to its original length. It was too long and dragged the film. Although the dance is fantastic, it would have been much better to leave it on the DVD as a deleted scene. <br /> <br /> All in all this is a great movie. My 5 year old loved it. And it's wonderful that the films I enjoyed as a child are passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just like I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** on **** <br /> <br />
