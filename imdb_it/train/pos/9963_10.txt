I saw this movie when I was a child. And I loved it every time. Of course, the graphics are a bit rough compared to now, but in the 70s it was exceptional. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and I thought it was wonderful. That was how I remember my Christmases were with my family: magic. Santa was great and I couldn't wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and you speak Spanish, take them to watch this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version from the one we're used to today, but who says there's a way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good and evil. I don't know what the English subtitled version is or if there is an English one, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad!
