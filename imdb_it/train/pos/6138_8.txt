This is a wonderfully funny old-fashioned children's movie with definitely the most attractive novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories that seem to have fun in the dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical hocus pocus story that is cute, light and charming. <br /> <br /> The story is set in the 1940s in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three children from Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins are evacuated from the danger of the air raids of World War II. They are sent by mistake to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by mail order to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic knob to go to London on their flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent principal of Miss Price's sorcery training correspondence school. Miss Price starts working on spells designed to give life to inanimate objects. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called Bookman and his partner, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is obviously wonderfully captivating as the eccentric training witch, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, principal of the defunct witchcraft school, which has now transformed the street wizard. This actor was previously chosen as the father of children in the movie Mary Poppins. In reality, this film is a story that is reminiscent of previous Mary Poppins, both fantastic fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this film does not have as memorable a music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but boasts some catchy little tunes. Some have been critical, but the film has excellent special effects. All in all, the story is lovely family entertainment. It is a pity that modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely and bewitching story, which should interest the child in all of us.
