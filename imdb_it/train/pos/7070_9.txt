One of the most interesting elements of a Gilliam film is that well-crafted images, disturbing backgrounds and maniacally frustrated characters are proof of the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where the director is a paid director with a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's vision and style, as opposed to making films unusual in their own interest. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar themes in Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, the loneliness of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel kingdoms. In this film Gilliam does an excellent job of blurring the lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know it. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill some gaps leads to criticisms of art house pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and artistic attitudes is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all his images have meaning. The two almost identical bathroom scenes by Cole are initially intended to draw comparisons that leave the audience upset. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the future world dominated by disease, but makes it recognizable in the world of 1996. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, since it requires that most of the story is enriched because its meaning is fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch also requires public thinking and interpretation. The film has immense value as a re-watch, since there are subtle details and suggestions that can be lost at first sight. Absolutely one of my favorites.
