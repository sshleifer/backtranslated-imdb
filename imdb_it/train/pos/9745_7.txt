As someone else commented, this is a wellness film. It has a glorious scenery and Luciano's full voice of wonder! I've seen this movie many times and I've seen it again this afternoon. I had forgotten how much I missed Pavarotti's song on Nessun Dorma and I need to get out of the CD! It's a good movie to spend the afternoon absorbed in fun and fantasy. Eddie Albert is as big as the agent and a little exaggerated, but all the agents are. The Italian countryside is beautiful but nothing exceeds the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need to play Olivier, this movie is not for you. If you just want a flight of fantasy and wonderful music, watch this movie. Have a good time!
