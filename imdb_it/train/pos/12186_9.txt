It's not as good a film as many people believe (including my aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But due to the best sections of this film noir, in particular the famous "fun house" finale, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has acquired an important position beyond its real value as a key to the saga of the failure to conquer Hollywood by Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> In 1946 the position of Welles as a Hollywood figure was mixed. CITIZEN KANE has not been recognized as the great film since it was seen because of the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by the Hollywood staff themselves. Welles's attempt at total control (direction, production and acting) of his films seemed to threaten the entire system. His best work during this time was Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE, presumably shot by Robert Stevenson, but actually shot to a large extent (with Stevenson's blessing) by Welles. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film that benefited from a post-war interest fleeing Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood it was just a big record. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to recapture his critical skills with his AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS production. But despite the assistance of Mike Todd and Cole Porter who composed the score, the musical was a failure. His failure occurred just as his wife, Rita Hayworth, was on the rise with her portrait of GILDA. So the marriage was also in ruins. <br /> <br /> Welles had to make money - his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in possible film rights to AROUND THE WORLD to Todd (whom he would later regret), and he also sold the idea of ​​a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin, which should have been directed at it (and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> The story is that of Welles, with a $ 10,000.00 bill to worry about, called Cohn and offered to make a movie with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do it, but of course he asked what the movie was. It was a wise question. Welles was on a public telephone in New York in a pharmacy with a book department. He grabbed a book called THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and raved that it was a great thriller. Somehow Welles convinced the usual crafty Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he would review the rights, and sent his $ 10,000.00 deposit to Welles. After Cohn hung up, Welles bought the book and read it, and found that it was really bad. He spent time rewriting a treatment and a script that would have created the character of Rita by Elsa Bannister. <br /> <br /> It certainly has a curious plot development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / docker. Elsa Bannister's rescue, when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a paralyzed criminal lawyer with a great reputation. She convinces him to hire Michael as skipper of their yacht. The cruise also contains Bannister's sinister partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa. When they can Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby continue to show up. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes an offer to Michael - wants (for reasons linked to his so-called fatalist vision of modern society) to give up, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes murky here) can he still collect his life insurance (even if dead?) And use it to escape to the South Seas. He will pay Michael $ 10,000.00 if he pretends to shoot Grisby. This actually includes the signing of a document admitting murder (Michael does not realize that such admission would eliminate the need to produce a corpse if all other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Obviously Grisby is killed and Michael is arrested for this, and for the murder of Broome (shot with Michael's gun). Michael is tried by Bannister who defends him and discovers that the latter is doing a second-level job because he wants Michael to be sentenced. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the real murderer and manages to escape just before the jury's verdict. He is thrown out and deposited in a desert carnival, and this leads to the famous "Fun House" sequence and the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly confusing film (as I commented). This does not mean that it is not worth seeing - visually it is surprising. Witness of the fight between Michael and the police in the trial judge's quarters, where he strikes the bailiff in the judge's library, smashing the windows. Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth's dives from a rock, reflected in Grisby's libidinal binoculars. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, especially Sloane (perhaps the best role of the best actor). Glenn Anders was one of the leading Broadway performers. He rarely made films before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable. Even Ted De Corsia does very well with Broome - a detective who is really looking for his own interests, at his own expense. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, it turns into a performance that was different from most of what she had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and THE FRAGOLA BIONDA are exceptions), and it is a memorable siren. O'Hara by Welles is a very unusual character for the actor: a nice but naive man who learns the hard way to disbelieve what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL, or CHIMES DI MEZZANOTTE, but it's a good movie for all this.
