SPOILERS CONTAINED TO MAKE A REMARK. <br /> <br /> Twenty years since 1984, this film talks a lot about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that sums up Prince's musical production of the last 10 years perfectly, or if you have taken the two best songs of his last 10 albums, you would have a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays like this. Prince runs into his dressing room after playing a song and the club owner enters the locker room to give Prince a good idea of ​​his fall from grace in the 90s and release albums that only the most ardent fans could tolerate and Support his artistic talent. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You're not packing them like you used to. The only person who digs your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about the musical subtitling that makes the prince even worse when he hits Apollonia in two separate scenes! It gave me the chills that this wasn't the only scene where women were abused in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm all for the sparring of the Morris Day and Jerome Benton comedy as these two stole every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman in a garbage can? It was simply ugly! The other ugly piece was the chalk shape of the father of the prince on the floor thoughtfully provided by the Minnieapolis police, which induces the prince to go even more crazy !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining film in general, as it is the soundtrack of Prince's songs that increase its value by 110%. But then again the film offers us another theory about Prince and his music, since the film tells us that the most important song in the Prince's film is written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes, wife who beats her musical father! <br /> <br /> Are Are Prince and the directors trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his father songs of written songs? Maybe that's why the prince started losing his temper during the 90s because he finished the ideas of his fathers ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
