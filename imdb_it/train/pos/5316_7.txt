This is the second film I saw of Ida Lupino as a director after 53 years of hitchhiker. I think this was a better film than that. This has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone watching and talking about her, so she runs away and is welcomed by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is just right to give him 2 and 1/2 stars.
