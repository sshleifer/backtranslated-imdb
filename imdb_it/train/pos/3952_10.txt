I feel like I have a rare disease that nobody has ever heard of and I finally found a support group on the net! In the end I found this title asking for an answer on an "expert" website on the web. I, too, saw this film in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and above all by the ending. I never forgot it and I've never seen it since. No one I know has seen the film and I almost gave up for ever finding the title. Alas, although I know the name, I will probably never see the film again because it is impossible to find it commercially. Small steps ... <br /> <br /> G
