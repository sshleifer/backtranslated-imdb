FREDDY has gone from scary to funny, in this sixth episode of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> 2 years have passed, as many as 11 actually since this film is set in 2001. And FREDDY killed all the last kids of Elm street except one, John Doe (Jacobb from part 5, also the film gives to who it is), in which it uses to bring more children to come to Elm Street. Not only does FREDDY get his desires, but he also gets his daughter back to Elm Street. When she finds out what's going on, she and other children decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We also see some of the mysterious backgrounds of FREDDY. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has been contended for a long time in the nightmare series. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He tried to highlight what FREDDY was doing with his witty jokes ... COMDEY and makes the series more fun than scary So this movie is really a comatose pain to talk about. It is not the wrost of the series, the second part still holds it. <br /> <br />
