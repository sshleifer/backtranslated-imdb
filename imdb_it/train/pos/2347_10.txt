I have been a Pushing Daisies fan since the beginning. It's beautifully designed and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how much TV needed an original and creative show like Pushing Daisies. It is a huge relief to see a show, unlike the rest, in which, if you compare it with some of the more recent shows, like Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities, and it becomes boring when you see shows so close in identity. <br /> <br /> With a magnificent cast, a wonderful script and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.
