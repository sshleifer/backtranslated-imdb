The Japanese "Run Lola Run", his is an unusual film that will put a smile on anyone's face. Fans of Run Lola Run, Tampopo, Go!, And Slacker will probably appreciate this. It tends to follow a formula that is increasingly popular in these days of separate, seemingly unrelated vignettes, all of which contribute to general history in unexpected ways. take it if you see it, otherwise wait for the rental.
