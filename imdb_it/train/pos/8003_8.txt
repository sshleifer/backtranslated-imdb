This film is a great show to watch with his wife or girlfriend. There are a lot of laughs and some interesting little nudist stories here. The actresses are all very interesting and certainly deserve to be seen in their natural beauty. Maslin's beach life is full of different nudists and personality types. The scenery of the Australian coast is simply splendid to see. What a place to visit, to say the least, and one day it could become my refuge. I really like this movie and I enjoy it more every time I watch it. I'd like to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is rather soft, this film is, of course, a great excuse to sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
