People are too difficult for the film. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "see" it again. <br /> <br /> It all comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his lens keeps going down. Then the fun begins while all those around him get "knocked down". <br /> <br /> Just think of JFK and all the people associated in some way with his murder, whose lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what's implicit in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent interpretation of what might have happened. Although the EXACT MY plot was not followed (hindsight here after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire") but it is what is implied that it is of interest. <br /> <br /> I'd like to have a copy of it to watch it again. In light of what is known today, The Domino Principle is right.
