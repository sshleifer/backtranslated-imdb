Oh my God, from the description of the box I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 days in the valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most, after directing this, would have escaped from a cliff or at least committed a mass murder. I confess I only look at the first half hour (for now). Reading all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to. Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor, but this is honored with humor and fantasy and this is inexorable in its severe realism. What did the Marshall Plan and the European Union do? Seeing this in a theater with someone I know would have meant a forced departure after several minutes longer than I got on DVD. There's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker from Hell. Whatever happens to you is not enough! The soulless suburbs that I thought existed only in Arizona and Florida prospered in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought that sexual circles had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and here they are in suburban malls? It was Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western civilization, "why could it be a good idea"? If the world was really like this movie, bring that black hole, we're ready.
