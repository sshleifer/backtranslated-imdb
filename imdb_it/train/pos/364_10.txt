Steven Speilberg's adaptation of the popular Alice Walkers novel is not without controversy. When members of the black community criticized the treatment of black men for the first time, others asked why a white man directed this film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. He has two sons from his violent father who are torn from his arms at birth. His only comfort in his miserable life comes from his sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played in the last few years by the newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married to a violent husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by his sister and is therefore quickly removed from Celie's life. <br /> <br /> The story is often heartbreaking as Celie continues to hope that one day she will meet with her sister and her children. Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including Sophia, a very hard-fingered wife to her stepson, and Shug, a noisy and juicy singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love. <br /> <br /> Speilberg's direction is all around this image, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I challenge you to watch this movie and not be touched! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story. While tending to minimize lesbian aspects and African history, both very vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing Alice Walker's voice to shine. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to respond to the controversy surrounding this film. Suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few films I can watch again and again and that has left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
