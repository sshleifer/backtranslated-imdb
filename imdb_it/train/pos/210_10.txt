Two great comedians in a great film by Neil Simon based on his hit comedy. <br /> <br /> Great combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. No wonder Burns won an Oscar for it; he is sharp and funny as always. And Matthau is a bit of a match, albeit a bit more disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is familiar to Simon's territory: two old vaudeville comrades get together for a television special, but they can't stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see these two take one another, their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. I particularly liked the "knock, knock, knock / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Matthau, you'll like it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put some "Sunshine" in your life.
