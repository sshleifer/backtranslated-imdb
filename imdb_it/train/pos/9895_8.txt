A group of high school students celebrate a cruel joke with nerd Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) that leaves him horribly disfigured. Five years later the band returns to the dilapidated high school and left for a meeting. Naturally, Marty, angry and vindictive, comes dressed in a jester costume to demand a gruesome revenge on her tormentors. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale trot all the banal and affectionate clichés that make this 80's sliced ​​body count so much fun approximate: fake jump jumps, steadanian shooting traps, a fierce storm, a mad groovy hard rock soundtrack, a nice smattering of free female nudity, a totally ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, f / x sticky trick, and one of those nicely lame "it was all just a terrible dream" fake unimpressed. Furthermore, the elaborate pieces of the murder deliver the gruesome products: the highlights of Gory include the stomach of a man who explodes after drinking poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a boy squashed under a huge tractor and two people who are electrocuted while in the midst of having a wild and passionate sex. Caroline Munro, the cult British horror triton mermaid is hilariously uncertain as an American teenager in the first third of the film. The cast performs solidly, with a particularly evident work by Carmine Iannaccone as the smartaleck bandmaster Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as Frank's silent Frank, and Donna Yeager as a Stella tart. Co-producer Dick Randall has an amusing cameo as Munro's nasty agent, Manny. The melancholy and lashing music of Harry Manfredini shamelessly recycles the cues of his "Friday 13" scores. Alan Pudney's refined photography does the trick. Good, fun trash.
