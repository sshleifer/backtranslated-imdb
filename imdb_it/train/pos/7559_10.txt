This movie is so beautiful! Despite Carmen Electra, this must be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is simply fantastic, and Loren Dean plays a crazy movie star very well. The plot is also great. It is all very real that it is scary. Here he says it's a drama, but this is one of the most fun dramas I've ever seen. Go take a look.
