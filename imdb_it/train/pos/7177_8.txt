I was so entertained in this insightful documentary, and I waited a long time to get it through the pipes (my local video chain), and it was worth it. I like a good documentary / piece of special interest, but this was definitely a heartfelt, honest and nostalgic, if you want, rethinking adolescent life. A child's imagination is fascinating, and this is where a great story begins. Rent or buy it if you like a funny, fun and all-around documentary. Mr. Stein and the company have certainly come a long way from video camcorder productions in the neighborhood and gay rings that turn gay people at a glance. They all seem quite successful in their respectful field, and it was nice to know that they are still all good friends. The DVD has some extra trailers for other good documentaries and features a number of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
