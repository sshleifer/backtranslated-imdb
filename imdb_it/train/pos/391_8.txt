"Zu: The warriors from magic mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You never imagined that it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued to do so in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and in subsequent productions.) Even now he can live up to other films in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is linked to the "Zu" warriors of the magic mountain "! You don't need to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this. The plot is a bit difficult to follow, but to be honest it doesn't. Everything depends from action and adventure! I was always wondering what Tsui Hark would have done if he had got his hands on CGI. Now we know, he made this film, maybe sometimes it's too much, but the overall result is so. I will be critical in this. There is so much success on the screen, you simply will not believe it! I think it is a real pity that this film was not screened in theaters here in the Netherlands ... film that screams for the screen in theaters! easily beat big-budget Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is the lack of humor! In most of Tsui Harks's films he combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor, in some so this movie is missing. Once again I won't be fussy about these little things. "Legend of Zu" offers the most beautiful special effects you will see on the action front. A true classic!
