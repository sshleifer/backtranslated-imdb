The story would never have won prizes, but it's not what it talks about ... the script was simply fun and enough suspense to make way for incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Who needs a story with such fighting? Really, it's worth looking at just this reason. If you can handle the gore, of which there is a lot ... none of this done in a realistic way that is hard to watch. I gave a 7.
