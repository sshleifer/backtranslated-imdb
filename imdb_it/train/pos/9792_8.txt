Once a year, a film like that arrives and makes things easy for you. You don't have to make an effort to think it's good, it's just it is. You enjoy watching it and you take it home with you. I can't say it's totally flawless, but it's close. Acting: great, interesting story with suspense elements. It's a small family story, almost predictable, but it's not the secret that matters. it's the way she takes the blind girl to reach her. I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I disliked most is the actress who played the mother, it was too hard and without necessity. Keren
