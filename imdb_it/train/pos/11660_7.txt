A beautiful piece of cinema for children buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Set the story around the famous Book of Kels, which is believed to have been composed by the monks of the small island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young abbot apprentice who goes into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the proud headless knight of pagan mythology. Hoping to recover a lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The films of true beauty are in its' animation. The cell is shaded in a luminous and inspiring style of deep complexity that gives the impression of looking less simple. Deriving greatly from the artistic style of the cartoon series "Samurai Jack" for its brilliant use of mark making and depth of background, The Secret of Kels creates a coherent and affective Celtic world that lives under the shadow of Vikings. <br /> <The story can be intensely inaccurate and the life forms portrayed lack realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant as the film places itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic revivalistic mysticism. The girl in the forest is a wonderful addition and, in my opinion, makes the image of what it is, as it slips from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities reminiscent of the legendary Cheshire Cat by Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Kels secret is a real pleasure. For all sexes, of all ages, it's a nice piece of cinema for families. <br /> <br /> Don't expect to be amazed but rather pleasantly impressed!
