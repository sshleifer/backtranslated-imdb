this is a visual adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue there appears in the word baloons as in the manga. the plot of this is existing but only vaguely explained. there is a number of the manga on which this is based available in English in the collection of blast books, 'comics underground japan', and has a dialogue with captions that explains the plot a little more here. I recommend checking the volume if you liked it, as it explains part of the "plot" of the film, which is otherwise inexplicable. as for the animation this is pretty decent, a good non-invasive use of computers and the images are mostly well made. jumps in and out of the episodes, while the characters, a cat and his dead brain dead sister wander in and out of a series of strange images: a boat, a circus, a desert. for half an hour they pass through a certain number of semi-plots and settings, which leads me to believe that the director has chosen a series of long-time manga numbers to fit randomly, but in a primitive way visually selected. knowing what's going on could somehow increase appreciation. this reminds me above all of the kind of things they played at the mtv show, the cartoon sushi, in particular a short film with a cat chasing a man's cheek around the house. only in this case the cats look more like hello kitty and their adventure expands to include death and reincarnation and a series of other themes [even if it is not so easy to understand what is happening]. the dvd of this has the comment of the director and a "making of" of characteristics, but I cannot comment on those because I have not had way to get around them. I'm giving an 8/10 for now, here there is not much to compare with in anime, and I hope more in this way.
