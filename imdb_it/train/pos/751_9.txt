This is one of the best Jodie Foster films out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misunderstanding as an animated film. He has wonderful performances, especially a fight scene between Jodie and his mother, played by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are a bit amateurish, but I think it's worth seeing.
