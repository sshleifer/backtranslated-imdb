When American author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a particular bet. Not believing in Poe's claim that all his gruesome stories were based on current experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can't spend an entire night in Blackwood's haunted castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers he is not alone, while being approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a metaphysical doctor - who explains that they are all lost souls to repeat the stories of their resignation on the anniversary of the their death! The first time I saw this glorious piece of classic horror, I was enchanted all the time. I found the film really creepy and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The musical score makes the atmosphere twice as much terror as it induces. The topless scene threw me for a ride, as I didn't expect. It seems that Synapse has done a great job with image optimization, because this film looks damn good for its age, and it's the Uncut International version, to be started. This is the film that commissioned me to create a collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
