If you want to have fun with a lot of subtle humor, then you'll have fun with this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why anyone would like this. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper that confuses you with your head and makes you laugh. It is not Shakespeare, but it is well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her place in this - better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a talent for subtle humor. Too bad I didn't have many opportunities to expand on this. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger adapts perfectly to his role as a "real Navy" and William McNamara does a solid job as a braggart. <br /> <br /> Throw a Hopper walk-on into the hunt for "the Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that caught my attention and made me laugh. I bought this as soon as available. <br /> <br /> Brain-candy.
