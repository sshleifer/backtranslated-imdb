My first child was born the year this program came out and I played the album for the kids every subsequent Christmas. When the CD was released, I bought about ten copies and gave them to friends and relatives anyway while starting families ... invariably it becomes their favorite Christmas album. Recently I found several DVDs (probably on DVD-R from videocassettes) for sale on eBay. What I bought was an excellent copy, and it was great to see the show after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that weren't in the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and the DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
