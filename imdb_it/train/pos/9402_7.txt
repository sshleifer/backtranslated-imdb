I only saw this film after hearing about it for years. Needless to say, the current experience turned out to be a bit anti-climate. However, Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast into a cheerful, albeit formidable, adventure in post-World War II industrial England. <br /> <br /> This is the family history of the pains of inventing the perfect daily product. Remember the car that runs on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear out, does not wrinkle or gets dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put off the market, and therefore the plot becomes a bit thick. Guiness makes the whole business profitable and watching it blow up the factory research lab over and over again is a big hit! (Those English ... always the upper lip stiff when under fire.) The film might be a bit strange like the inventive invention of Guiness, but it's still a nice ride.
