this film is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war, and it really happens, not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed by this movie, by acting and by the story where I like big movies because It's a true story Giff is me a feeling that I was there and I'm sorry for the director that Maruschka Detmers is playing because who wants to end life here like that. I recommend everyone to see this movie, special young people and learn something from this film. This film can be compared to the orange soldier of the film or any other true story that happened during the Second World War.
