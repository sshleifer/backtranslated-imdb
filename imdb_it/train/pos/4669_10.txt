If there were two more fascinating artists than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith who appeared together in a more fascinating 1968 film, I don't know who they were. I saw this delicious little satirical gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 for the first time, and I consider every year that I could not sit down to look at it again a wasted one. He is intelligent, bizarre, clean, melancholy, sweet, sweetly subversive and absolutely charming. The love story of these two social misfits is at the same time full of comedy and terribly moving - never more than in the desperate attempt of Maggie Smith to make the right card appear in the deck, a sadly funny scene and a perfect miniature portrait of excruciating loneliness. And that last still image on Ustinov's anxious, worried and affectionate face as he asks: "Are you okay?" - has anyone ever created the appearance and sound of devotion so perfectly and naked? I would never know anyone who didn't like this movie well.
