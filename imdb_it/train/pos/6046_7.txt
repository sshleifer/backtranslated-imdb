I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's face it; the premise does not seem particularly tempting when you have to deliver the money for a night movie, but it has an accommodating nature that wins one. There were no moments that I found amazing, and I doubt those I will remember the next day, but this does not fail as a nice diversion. What I found funny was watching him here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like. I told her there was a plot: three guys have to bring some grass to London. Hardly satisfactory for her. There are no attacks going on here for the camera that I expected after reading a number of comments. However, I make an exception to the comparisons with Withnail and I; not in the same league, and I doubt it was destined for www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
