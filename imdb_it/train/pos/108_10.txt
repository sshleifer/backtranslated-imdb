"Europe" (or, as is also known, "Zentropa") is one of the most visually beautiful films I've ever seen. The mixture of grayscale and color photography is almost perfect ... a real feast for the eyes. The image was a contender for a 1991 Golden Palm in Canners. The award went to Barton Fink (from the Coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Here is an exercise in the classroom: rent both films and be a judge for yourself.
