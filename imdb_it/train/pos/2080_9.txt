The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH, as captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a crowd for not having time to shoot MORE than the looters between them, as his unit has just been called back to the forefront. Obviously, the next looter about to be discovered and filmed is the main character of the film, the former slave of the kitchen O-Lan (for whose interpretation Luise Rainer, now 99 years old, won her second best consecutive actress Oscar <br / > <br /> The next scene finds O-Lan who dutifully delivers his stolen jewelery bag to his valiant husband, the farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), setting in motion the classic dichotomy of a man's ascending financial mobility it is the direct inverse of its moral decline. <br /> <br /> For a film that deals with topics such as slavery, false accusations, misogyny, hunger, domestic invasion, eating pets, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, disorders, civil war, summary executions of mass, bigamy, infantile beatings, adultery, incest and insects of biblical proportions, THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly poignant film. <br /> <br /> My thought of separating is in the form of another classic citation, from O-Lan itself (as she inserts the precious soup of soup that her son has just admitted to having stolen from an old woman in the kitchen pot, after her husband Wang Lung he had angrily thrown on the dirty floor on the other side of their hut): "Meat is meat".
