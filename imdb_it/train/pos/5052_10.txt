This is an excellent film. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, it is largely family, winter, canoeing, catching, hunting and the like. It's easy to take the family member for granted, but after watching this movie he has sometimes grown up about me. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians for director Attenborough and screenwriter Nicholson to expand the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan interprets a complex man well, a very beautiful performance. Annie Galipeau is adorable in her first big role. The rest of the cast is solid.
