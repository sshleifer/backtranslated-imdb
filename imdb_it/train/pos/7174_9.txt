I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this before the movie - and I'm really glad I did. Being a big movie fan and a Northern Californian all my life, I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films were made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to be in the Bay Area instead of going to Los Angeles, George Lucas' comments on perseverance, community and vision really resonate with me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other directors can do it in San Francisco, so can other artists. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film
