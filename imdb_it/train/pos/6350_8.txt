I waited and waited for this film to come out, the trailers seemed to have been going on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again, but I can't wait for this to come out for everyone to buy! He wasn't a big Jim fan, but that was fine with him, there was so much to see and the 'wellness factor' is off the charts, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a fantastic job turning it into a movie, if you didn't see it, do it, if you have it, look at it again, I know you want it!
