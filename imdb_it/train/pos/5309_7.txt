The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the intelligent Pecker (captivatingly interpreted by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt ("he is a thief, but he is a really good boy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> The film makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer, and manages to make this point without being too heavy on it. There is always the risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of the "common people", of slipping into a kind of backhand "holier than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the public to obtain the point while allowing enough breath for the viewers to compare this message with their thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the film mainly because it is very funny.
