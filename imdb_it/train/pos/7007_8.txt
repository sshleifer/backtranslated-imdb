From the first scene you are given clues about what might happen here. It becomes increasingly evident as the story continues. Acting is excellent in everything and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was extremely puzzled by the reason. I'm still puzzled as to why Ben did what he did. We could see "second thoughts" in the face, but the last sacrifice seemed to go against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story, but it left me confused. Perhaps this was the point of the film. I liked the film and Wil Smith can revive another good film choice. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
