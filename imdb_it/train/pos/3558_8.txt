Together with South Pacific, Guys and Dolls is for adults - - it's cheeky, sexy and full of men who are men and women who are bonded. <br /> <br /> There is an energy and a guide that makes this stand out from the rest of the group: the strength of Jean Simmond's performance, the charm of a young Brando and an already masterful Sinatra add much to the general feeling and the look of the piece. <br /> <br /> Vince Guys and Dolls as it is shamelessly what it is: a MGM musical. <br /> <br /> Still good to look at and listen to even with great melodies and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and will be looked forward to for years to come. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
