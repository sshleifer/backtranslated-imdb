- After their children have been sentenced to life imprisonment, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) start receiving threatening phone calls because someone brings down their children. The couple decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that will soon be very successful. One of the students has a rich, unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with a radio evangelist. It's just a matter of time before everything falls apart and women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can't help comparing What is Matter with Helen? at Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, also played by Shelly Winters. Where that movie seemed almost held back in its presentation of Auntie Roo's madness, there is nothing that holds Helen back in this movie. It could take a good part of the movie's running time, but when it goes off, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You don't want to joke with her. Winters is so deliciously insane that it was impossible for me not to enjoy his performance. I don't want to ruin the film, but the things Helen is capable of are totally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> - As Winters is, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in his role as a gold -digging tap dancer. I got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her a prize. This is not Citizen Kane! Stop behaving so seriously. Hey, Debbie, you don't understand that your main purpose is to be a victim of Winters' madness. <br /> <br /> - I love these ex-women-stars-in-the-twilight- horror films of their careers. What is the matter with Helen? it's fun like any
