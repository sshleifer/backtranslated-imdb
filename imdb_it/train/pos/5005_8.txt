With films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" to their credit, the good people on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, are introducing us to some of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts". . <br /> <br /> Derived from a brief period at the beginning of their career, "Creature Comforts" is a show of the slice of life in which fragments of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some kind. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animation has crossed the country interviewing people with harmless questions like "Are you a liar?" and then speed things up a bit by asking about their sexual lives. <br /> <br /> The answers, even if they seem boring and trivial, are actually quite funny, when you understand that the dialogues come first and the animals are added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person making the statements? One of the characters who discusses what he is looking for in a woman, "I like them very thin". it is an insect, the walking stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs that discuss smells and smells while sniffing the back of a poodle while talking about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. While the "wife" tells the litany that is her health, her long suffering husband is beside her, without saying anything. <br /> <br /> While it may take some time for "Creature Comforts" to find its "legs", it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there are more Carter reality shows that have liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and is definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> Some of the humor might seem a little bold, it's the claymation that captures children's attention (like the old Batman series of the 1960s, the jokes are subtle enough that children won't understand them) and are the jokes that are there for adults.
