Allen and Julie move to a cabin in the mountains after their daughter was murdered one night. No one knows who killed the girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and is infested with people who killed themselves and no one in the nearby city wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of anxiety and has a lot of parts that made me jump. Some parts are predictable but once in a while there's a part I didn't expect. It was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it good enough. <br /> <br /> I also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends. It's also kind of a sad movie, but a well-made horror movie.
