It seems more than go unnoticed that such a disaster as "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (the new version) can find DVD distributors while the old - and far superior works like this film - are not found by Nowhere. With all the ongoing debate on the morality (or lack thereof) of the war and the interest in espionage (considering the multiple productions Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible", this seems to be an obvious choice for exit on DVD: True, it looks like a 1968 film because it's a 1968 film. But aside from the consideration of style, this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say, and has a lot of twists to entertain public If nothing else, SOMEBODY please consider the soundtrack on a sort of CD, whether it is a compilation with other Morricone music or as an independent version I don't know if people in the industry are concerned about reading this what fans need to say about their products, but if you are reading this and other comments, please take us seriously.We are paying for your sumptuous homes with our hard-earned dollars for tickets, DVDs and CDs: give us that c he want! , if you are reading this and you have not seen this movie, we will lobby for its release so you can see what they are talking about those of us who have seen it. You will not be disappointed.
