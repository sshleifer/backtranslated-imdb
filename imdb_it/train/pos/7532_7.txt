The New Batman Adventures (also called Gotham Knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of Batman: the Animated Series (B: TAS) and has only aired for 24 episodes. This is not a horrible show, but it's not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I will start with all the things I found not very good. <br /> <br /> The first thing is the first, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: even TAS did this, but it was drawn on a dark palate, the color of the sky was more threatening, in this show the color of the sky is too bright. It all looks like any other children's show and doesn't look as unique as Batman: TAS has done with its dark and cool art style on Gotham. The artistic style is OK, but it no longer reminds me of Batman. Each character is composed of straight lines, squares and triangles that make the characters appear less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters look more like drawn versions of real people. The animation could be more coherent here than in B: TAS, but certainly not so good. <br /> <br /> Next: some of the episodes seem too stupid and childish, but some of the topics covered are even stronger than those of B: TAS (Two-Face that tries to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and some bad guys have a pretty tough treatment). This brings me to my next point. <br /> <br /> Because this should happen in the future as well as the final episodes of the animated universe of Batman, many criminals make their end or leave forever. Poison Ivy seems to drown when a cruise ship explodes; Two-Face almost kills Penguin, Killer Croc and himself, so he moves to Arkham forever; Joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (although he will return later to the animated series of the Justice League); Catwoman moves to France leaving Batman, etc ... Just because the series is ending doesn't mean they have to get rid of some great characters! Even the bad reasons are pretty bad. There are none! In B: TAS, we learn that these criminals are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, which is why they act like them, in this show, the wicked are only committing crimes to advance the story. It is as if Batman did not even bother to save whatever sanity remains in the people he fights, but he defeats them meaninglessly. This Batman is a colder, meaner version of the character, but since he's been doing this for years, I can see why it's so hard. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, the models of characters redesigned: they are horrible. Gordon has lost about 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains seem STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are among the worst). Although, I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same, and Ivy (who is even hotter now) has pale green skin. <br /> <br /> With the series that has many flaws, some episodes are fantastic - Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware the Creeper, Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight and Never Fear are my favorite here, in my opinion. Also all the crossovers with Batman in the Superman Animated Series were fantastic. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part of this show is how the creators claim to love the animation of this series rather than the original. In the DVD features of the original Batman animated series, they talk about how proud they were of the artistic style and difficulty with which some characters had to animate, but in the end they succeeded (the difficult animation necessary to animate Clayface, for example). In the features of the New Batman Adventures DVD, the creators basically say "To Hell with B: TAS, this is a new, new re-vamp, looks better and we like how we ALMOST COMBINE THE SERIES!" (Okay, this is an exaggeration). When the creators abandoned the extraordinary artistic style of B: TAS, this really annoyed me! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad show, but I don't like it as much as the original animated series. At least the show does not speak to its audience, so for this reason I still recommend it. Although some of the episodes of this new series are fantastic and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: the Animated Series and Justice League: the Animated Series are great follow-up shows for Batman: the Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, so give them a watch too.
