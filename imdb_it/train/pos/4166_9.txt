Before Cujo, there was Lucky the devil dog. In 1978, on the night of Halloween, the film "The Dog of the Devil, The Mastiff of Hell" was previewed. A story of a family that is receiving a new puppy (from a farmer in the neighborhood selling fruit and vegetables) because their dog Skipper was killed. Coencidenza? Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long before his father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where The Boys Are, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different, as are her children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Tata and professor, Hello Larry , Tuff-Turf) have changed. Does the dog have anything to do with this? He is determined to discover and do everything necessary to save his family. <br /> <br /> This film is fantastic because it has Ike and Kim playing a dark side of themselves compared to what we saw in those mountain witch movies. This is one of the many horror movies made for TV in the 70s that was really scary for a horror movie made for TV. The music was creepy and even the ending I won't say made you think. <br /> <br /> This film also features the participation of Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who can't stay away from the devil's films remember "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
