When the United States entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to churn out propaganda films. THE LITTLE The American is probably the best of the lot because he plays Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman divided between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but his decision is delayed due to the war when both men enlist. <br /> <br /> When the ship on which Pickford sank is sunk by the Germans (think of Lusitania) because it carries ammunition, Pickford has a great scene while he is on the lifeboat and shouts to the German commander. Later, of course, he will meet both Holt and Hatton when he is detained as a prisoner of war in a castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille offers a really great scene in this movie like Pickford and Holt is wandering around a bombed village. They pass a destroyed church of which only a standing wall remains. There is a very large crucifix against the wall. While they are watching, the wall collapses but the figure of Jesus remains suspended in mid-air. It is a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very direct and not artistic. <br /> <br /> Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the jerky arm histrionics used by many other actors of the day. It's also very pretty. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is OK. Among the names of "extra" actors are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> great movie, but interesting to see American propaganda at work.
