I'd like to give Kolchak a higher score, but the show quickly went from scary / suspenseful to stupid. Fault of ABC. They moved the show on Friday night at 8:00, so known as "family time". First, it should not have been Friday. I was a sophomore in high school and loved the first few episodes! It was the first time against Police Woman on NBC. The ABC had huge problems with Friday night. A bad season for them in general until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT made their debut in January 1975. Kolchak should have been a success. Darren McGavin pleaded to get out of his contract to end the show. Too bad the writing didn't concern Richard Matheson in the original TV movies. However, McGavin created Kolchak as the actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That INS set with manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems strange and ancient today, yet it was part of the appeal. They were very fortunate to have Simon Oakland take "Vincenzo" from the TV movies.
