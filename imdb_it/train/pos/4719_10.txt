This film is why I found this site. I couldn't find this movie anywhere else! I'm so happy to have found it here! We've already seen it on TV and we wanted desperately to find it and buy it and have several friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it was boring, although I must say that it is NOT so. Especially if you are a person on horseback, you will love this movie. The horses are fantastic, well trained and the film is well done. It's definitely one we will buy for our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The link between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a film that we will watch several times.
