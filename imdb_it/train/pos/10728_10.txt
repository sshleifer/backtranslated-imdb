The perfect fantasy space film. a group of children accidentally climbs into space and has to go back down, but they, of course they do. This wouldn't be a family movie if they were all dead. Then it will be all sad. You don't want Kate Capsaw, the protagonist to be a Golden Globe performance, but unfortunately, she and Lea Thompson won one. This makes me sick. I can't say enough, this movie is so beautiful, Lea Thompson-o lord, a perfect girl for this movie. This film is the best for sure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated and the space field has been so undervalued. It should be the opposite <br /> <br /> excellent 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. Iam is not good at math
