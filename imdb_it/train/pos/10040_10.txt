As for me personally, this film is one of my first four ever. No exception. James Cameron has sometimes shown himself to be a master storyteller. Through films like Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confident director with regards to action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is very different from the other strokes of genius. The film is exceptionally moving and leaves room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famous traveler who sinks into his maiden voyage is a legend, so the challenge for Cameron was to make a true, interesting and funny film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose during the night, with the release of this film, thus becoming a superstar and in most films it bothers me when the supporting characters don't have much to do, but in this film it is more decisive because, like an old Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story, it is immediately evident that it is the story of Rose and Jack alone, no one else. Emotionally it is completely satisfying and cannot leave the eye dry in a theater or in a house. Music has become iconic and legendary. It is the most refined soundtrack of the composer James Horner of all time and evokes so much the film and the audience. The song after a long time has become boring, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon that it is and this is the film. The only problem, the usual problem of James Cameron, is the dialogue that is memorable, but in a negative sense as in the approximate way of the points, but apart from that. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that takes you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart will not go on from this.
