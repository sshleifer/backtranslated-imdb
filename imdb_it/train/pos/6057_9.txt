Of course, for its super images and its fantastic sound, it's a great "show off" home theater record, but also a moving drama and an informative documentary. The parallel stories that intertwine during this film will keep all viewers interested. Young, old, boys and girls will find that, after all, we are all fans of the car, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, naivety and perseverance. The soundtrack by Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder perfectly matches the graphics and content. I don't want to give away the ending, but Quincy Jones's latest "Days Like These" guide sequence could bring a tear to the eyes. Have fun!
