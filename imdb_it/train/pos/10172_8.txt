"Rumors" by Friz Freleng is an excellent private comic strip from Snafu which warns against the spread of panic-induced rumors during the war. Snafu's short films have been produced, like all short films, to be shown to the military public as amusing educational films, "Rumors" is extremely imaginative and contains tons of ideas in its very short duration. When Snafu starts talking about a bombing, it turns into a possible rumor that America has lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated by a long and rubbery piece of baloney and several strange imaginary creatures that come back to haunt Snafu with more and more terrible news about the soldiers of his country. The "indiscretions" are inventive, frantic and amusing, which contribute to obscuring the rather "laborious, military" message. It stands as one of the best short films in the Private Snafu series.
