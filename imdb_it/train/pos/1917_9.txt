This was a wonderfully entertaining comedy with an exceptional cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly expressed as parents, and even the children were fantastic. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, who was sort of a small version of Kelly Bundy from Married with Children. The script and performances were both top notch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series and put a stop to things. They had to climb to change the show and bring more cast members, and it was obviously an unpleasant situation, but they managed well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have lasted longer if Ritter had lived. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked it when they took Ed O'Neill to a guest place. It was great. <br /> <br /> *** up ****
