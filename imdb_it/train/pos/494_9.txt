This is the beginning of an interesting new Star Trek series. It has a "down to earth" approach, with a darker and less "plaggy" setting. <br /> <br /> Characters need more time to develop but have potential. A rather disappointing thing (with all the Star Trek series) is that they represent such a bleak picture of equality between men and women in the future, when they paint a very positive image of everything else. (Earth has stopped the war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters here are two, the subcomandante T'Pol who is Vulcan and the communications officer Hoshi who is human. Hoshi is rather skinny and T'Pol is made to be a "vulcan babe". <br /> <br /> Some crew attitudes feel a little too American (in contrast to the more international TNG crew feeling) but create interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A great driver though for a very good series.
