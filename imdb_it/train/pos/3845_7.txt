An unusual, slow, funny erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will also be difficult for them not to appreciate the numerous imaginative sequences contained in this film, or to ignore Krabbe's top-notch performances. Verhoeven maintains an interesting ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the hero's visions - omens. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur, and the unsatisfactory ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
