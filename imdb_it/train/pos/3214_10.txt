I fell in love with this silent action movie. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played it so well. Raised since childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, Todd (Kurt Russell) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically modified soldiers. <br /> <br /> The stage is set and another classic icon of action films was born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell has this role and made it entirely his - original, bold and all too human. I miss the fact that the sequels were never made. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> My faith: http: //www.angelfire. com / ny5 / jbc33 /
