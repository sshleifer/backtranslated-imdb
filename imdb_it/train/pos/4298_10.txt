This film impressed me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find him uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it empowering. And I always find the human and real characters. It is a film that shows you the harsh reality of life in Los Angeles, starting with the recurring search lights of the helicopter that scan the hidden dangers so close to the ordinary lives brought by the characters. It is also a film that shows you how a stranger's kindness can change your life and gives you the chance to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether it's designed or not, has powerful repercussions. I found this film in many ways similar to the Robert Altman movie Short Cuts. Both had a cast of actors and actresses with famous actors and both films allowed you to gradually see how the characters interacted with each other and influenced each other, for better or for worse. Grand Canyon did a better job of delivering a coherent message, (hope in the face of desperate reality), of the Altman movie, even though I found them both intriguing in their own way. This film is not to be missed !!!
