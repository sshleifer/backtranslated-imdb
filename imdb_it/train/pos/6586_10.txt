Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, with the narrow border of the great Basil Rathbone, and this is probably the best adaptation of a Conon-Doyle story. <br /> <br /> An adaptation of length includes some new aspects of the plot that fits the surrounding drama well and increases the hatred one feels for Milverton. <br /> <br /> Excellent all-round performance, especially by Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick completely rounded and comfortable in their roles make this a superb piece of drama.
