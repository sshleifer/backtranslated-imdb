Well, if you have an open mind enough to appreciate Barber Shop, then you'll like this Canadian film. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give it to the current score which has: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a film for anyone willing to watch movies outside of their racial bases. It's engaging, it's true for life, on two or three occasions you lose connections between scenes, but many times, especially towards the end, you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often reflects what it can be life. <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to anyone willing to open up beyond the traditional American film.
