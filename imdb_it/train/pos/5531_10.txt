Watching "The fox and the child" was an intoxicating experience. The luxuriant graphics, the integrity of the point of view and the absolute beauty of the environment and the characters have left me in a delirium of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complicated. Deceptively simple. In the container of that simplicity a world develops that attracts you and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> This is a film you can trust - indulge yourself. I would dare to say that it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - of any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if they were seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true art attracts the viewer beyond a point of view in ecstatic participation in reality. I feel I had the privilege of watching - no, of participating - in this film, a work of true art.
