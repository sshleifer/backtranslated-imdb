I don't remember when I heard about this film for the first time, but I rented it about six years ago, and it still remains one of my favorite comedies. I have to admit, you will probably despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music. But if you are a rap fan, even if occasional, you will love the jokes and the internal references. One of the best lines of the film concerns the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use this line today and I have lots of laughs. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played the nerd Lamar in "Revenge of the Nerds". It is unfortunate that this film will probably never get a DVD version.
