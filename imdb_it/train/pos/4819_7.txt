Overall, I thought it was a very nice film - I hate using the word "nice" because it's pretty dry but it was very nice to see and the central performances of Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong. What I liked the most is that, despite the sparkling aesthetics of the costumes and set designs, all golden and brilliant, this aspect never took over the heart of the film, which was a good and strong writing (thanks Julian Fellowes : D); nothing too sparkling or saturated with pomp, not very sensationalized (when Victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed that she is now Regina, well you could not have a less glamorous hand on the crown). It was gently stimulated and each line in the film held its value. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly the representation of the love between Victoria and Albert, even if a little fairy in the face, was actually a slowly burning candle and Friend and Blunt were right to show how easily these two people "have adapted" together despite the fact that the union was initially organized (my myth was when they return home after the hunt and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind, so much said without words, this is all about the movie). Blunt also kept her beauty, she has a face that requires your attention and I can't fail to mention the costumes she wears - everyone just gorgeous. If I were Blunt I would have a hard time separating myself from any of them! The rest of the cast of the cast played well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide is a highlight. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have is that it lacked a sense of urgency, or an event that could have made the film a little more exciting? (He was pretty tame) I don't know, I wanted something to happen that would take Victoria to draw strength and prove that it was worth a little more. When she and Albert discussed, I loved it, I could have done with some more dramatic moments, even though this could just be me. <br /> <br /> Finally, at the risk of appearing entirely patriotic, he has renewed a sort of pride and admiration in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in such a young one. This may be partly due to the fact that the instant shooting of this film of Victoria's young life is immediately suited to what I wrote for one of my characters in "The Sword & The Scion", but it did bring up those feelings (for those who follow my book, you can guess which character reflects Victoria so appropriately? which only in turn renews the appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic domain. It made the government look pretty useless - not much has changed, I suppose. <br /> <br /> BLOG on films and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com
