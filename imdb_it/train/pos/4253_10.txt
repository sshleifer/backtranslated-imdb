really excellent movie, one of the best I've seen. Touching and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's simply beautiful. not too much of anything, just as it should be. I really loved the idea of ​​the film, nobody is bad or good, all or just people, sometimes they make mistakes mainly because of the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you do not have reasons to get angry - you can do it, but in the end the anger disappears and then you have to let love return even if it is difficult, there lies true happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and actors, the film really makes you feel the feel of the movie. <br /> <br /> beautiful handsome handsome. <br /> <br /> I advise you to see it, especially if you like to see the life of the Italians ....
