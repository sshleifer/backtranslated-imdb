Marjorie (a splendid and compelling interpretation of Farrah Fawcett) avoids being assaulted in her car by the violent serial robber Joe (played superbly with frightening conviction and intensity by James Russo). However, Joe steals his wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He pays her a visit one fateful day. After subjecting Marjorie to a lot of degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to overturn the tables on Joe and locks him in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone invent a harsh, raw and often disturbing tale of morality that cleverly nails the crude brutality and painful degradation of rape while also showing how every person pushed to the extreme is capable of shocking violence and inhumanity. Joe perceives women strictly as objects while Marjorie sees only Joe as an "animal". However, this film for his admirable credit refuses to make Joe a simple one-dimensional worm; instead it is a terribly real human monster and ultimately pitiful with a wife and child (Joe's climatic confession in particular is genuinely moving). Fawcett and Russo are both exceptional in contacts; they receive excellent support from Diana Scarwid as passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the sensitive Patricia, and Sandy Martin as friendly police officer Officer Sudow. The agile cinematography of Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Redford's shiver, the creeping skin score, greatly increases the considerable claustrophobic tension. A real power plant.
