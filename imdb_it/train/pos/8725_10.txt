I liked Antz, but I liked "A Bug's Life". The animation that was put into this has paid off. I will definitely get it on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a widescreen version of this film on tape. (I've heard of crushing all the characters on the screen in the standard video format). Most will have to agree that the credits were the most fun! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can't see the other!
