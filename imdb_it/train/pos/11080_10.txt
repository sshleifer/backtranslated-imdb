First of all, when people hear "GUY RITCHIE", they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They don't expect him to explore new frontiers. This REVOLVER film is different from the snatch; it is much darker and is very complex. The reason I gave a score of 10 is because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. It is very well written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was done wonderfully, the photography is beautiful, and in it you can recognize the personal touch of Guy Ritchie (directing style). <br /> <br /> What conquered me was the complexity of the protagonist and the way we stayed with more questions than answers
