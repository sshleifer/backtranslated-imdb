This game is very addictive, I continued to play for hours until late at night, but also the fact that you can't save a game when you're in space has contributed to this, sometimes I just had to play to not lose all the game data . <br /> <br /> So yes, "Freelancer" is compelling but also quite imperfect. Also, for example, something that bothered me a lot was that you couldn't skip any cut scenes with the result that sometimes you had to look at the same cutting scene a few minutes after time. A great opportunity for me to multitask to check my e-mail or chat with my friends and other things, while I had to wait for the cut scene to finish. <br /> <br /> History begins to promise but the more it gets, the more ridiculous it becomes. Even the game ends quite abruptly, at least it did for me. It is quite obvious that they are hinting at an imminent following. I don't know if a sequel is in the works right now, but I'm sure that I'll probably get one after it's released. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very simple! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To put it bravely, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game which may be a little too short. But thank God for the multiplayer option! It allows you to continue playing short missions, just like the single player game once completed. <br /> <br /> Although the fate of the game is the same, it remains simply beautiful to be in the middle of sometimes massive fights. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good but not revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Engaging game but attentive to its flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
