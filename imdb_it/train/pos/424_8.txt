I love this movie because I grew up around with harnesses. Pat Boone behind the sullenness reminds me of my father who was attracted by his paws because, unlike the thoroughbred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 house in Indiana is a better film, but it's also a very different film. April Love is light and easy to watch, a good movie. (Disappointing even though Pat Boone's religious / moral views prevented him from ever kissing the girl! A change from today's classic fare.) Home in Indiana with Walter Brennan (shot in black and white with no hint that anyone could ever break out in a song) it captures stress and struggles better, making the end result more satisfying but requires a greater emotional investment.
