Theo Robertson commented that WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after the First World War that led to the birth of Hitler and the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Maybe he lost the first ONE and a quarter of OURO of volume 8? It covers this period and, along with the previous volumes of the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I believe. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this time, joined the Hitler Youth, and his experiences were very similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is far above the History Channel documentaries. just that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The ONLY fault, and it's small, that I have with WAW is this: the numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about a loan, then how much war material was lent / loaned? How much in Russia, how much in English? How many merchant ships have sunk U-boats and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese fleet have in 1941 in 1941? What kind were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies in total and by nation? A lot of numbers could have made many spectators nod, but I would have preferred more! And of course, I always want to see more military analysis. How WHY did Patton & Clark not trap the German army that was in Cassini, after having surrounded it, instead of running from Monty to Rome and letting it escape? I don't think you can begin to understand the war until you've seen some of these "total war" video segments, like the Dresden fire. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., Before seeing the footage of the death camps: you can't just walk around it - it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time, and of course, it was the most serious cruelties and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "Flyboys") and some LIVE viviseziones of prisoners of medical "experimentation", without anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
