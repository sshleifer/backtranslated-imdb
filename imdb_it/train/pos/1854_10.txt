Having developed a critical eye for cinema and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my symbolically held breath. While I'm a cheeky fan of Denzel Washington - both of his skill as an actor and his public persona; I'm a pretty honest fan to admit the (very few) times he's never hit the target in a movie or two. And I could be wrong, after all, I'm not an actor. But this was different - Denzel would have poured the experience of his career into, and led, a film that dealt with one of the most delicate subjects known to man: the abuse of a child. As his directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to indicate that he would successfully present a man's triumph. I didn't want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I wasn't. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a film full of promise that linked a heterogeneous audience and gave the inexperienced spectator a brief but sincere eye in the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite everything. He did this film - and a dry eye of any color in the theater proved it. It takes someone to know the arguments of this film to know when the truth is presented. It takes a talented director to tell the story convincingly when you haven't tried it. And if he manages to involve the public further, and makes the audience respond emotionally, without mercy, the director has done his job. In each film Black, white, purple or polka dots. This is what makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and, above all, Antwone Fisher: you really won.
