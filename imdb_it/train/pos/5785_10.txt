While reading the comments left for this show, I could not help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had not actually watched any of the episodes of the show or even of their own volition. The thing about Kerching! is that it is a show for children, FOR CHILDREN, so, obviously, if your older one will seem mischievous, forced and probably stupid. I also found a person who said that the sets were stupid, but I remember that at the age of eight I wondered why Taj had the Ikea prints on the wall, and even wondered if my parents would let me paste on mine (they didn't) . Yes, it can be annoying, the acting could be better and some of the characters do really strange things with their hair, but as a children's show, I consider it 10/10. Compared to the things that hover today in their place, well, let's just say that I want it to be aired again. DVD release, anyone?
