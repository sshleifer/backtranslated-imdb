I watch them all. <br /> <br /> Not better than the fantastic ones (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Shall we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it is completely respectable and pleasantly different in the parts. <br /> <br /> I am a teacher of English and I find some ignorance about the language in some of these rather shocking reviews. For example: the "name should scream not look". How it moves. "Since when can movie titles ignore grammar?" /> <br /> There is nothing intrinsically incorrect in the English grammar of the Caribbean, it is not just the standard English Canadian grammar, it seems to me the comments on the dialogue, I put the subtitles because they are a standard English Canadian speaker, so I have simply assumed AUTOMATICALLY that I would have had problems understanding it all.It was not that difficult and it gave a distinctly different taste as the other step films I saw were so American. <br /> <br /> I loved the fact that this film was set in Toronto and, in fact, I wish it were even more clearly set there I liked that the heroine was so atypically chosen. I liked the step routines. I liked the character of the driven mother. I have heard that many of the film's problems have been tackled more subtly than is characteristic of dance films. In summary, if you tend to like dance films, then this is a decent film. If you have problems with English grammar superiority, you've grown up talking, your narrow mind might have a hard time enjoying this movie.
