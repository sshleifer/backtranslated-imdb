James Cagney is best known for his tough roles and gangster roles, but he also played very "soft" characters in his career. This musical is one of them and was the first, but not the last, musical film in which Cagney would have acted. <br /> <br /> Cagney is also doing a bit of singing in this and also a good deal of dance. And it must be said that he was not bad. He plays the role with great confidence. Apparently he had some dance work in his early years, before his acting career began to take off big time, so it's not a strange thing that he even took part in musical acting roles in his career. Obviously he also feels at ease in this genre that is completely different from that in which most people are used to seeing it. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, perhaps among the best and most successful directors of the genre. His first musicals of the 1930s have practically defined the musical genre and he was also responsible for genre films like "42nd Street". His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedies than anything else. The musicals of the 1930s never really focused on his way of singing, this was something that was more present in the 40s and later musicals, mainly from the MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual he has a light and simple story, set in the musical world, which obviously is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way. It's still a fun and simple story that also makes this a fun movie to watch. So do the characters and the actors who portray them. A bit strange for the fact that the total plot of the film is abandoned towards the end of the film, when the film begins to be composed only of routines of musical numbers. <br /> <br /> The musical moments towards the film the end of the film is also fun and well done, even if I'm not a big fan of the genre itself. Once again the musical numbers also include a young Billy Barty. he often played kids / babies / mice and anything else at the beginning of his career, including the musical "Gold Diggers of 1933", a year earlier. <br /> <br /> A film recommended for the first genres. <br /> <br /> 8/10
