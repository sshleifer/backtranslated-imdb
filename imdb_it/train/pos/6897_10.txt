It was released in France on DVD several years ago: I would like it to be republished with English subtitles. Don't confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz who gets negative reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a soothsayer who will marry the king's daughter. He leaves to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in a film in advance for her. I won't ruin the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss for the movement.
