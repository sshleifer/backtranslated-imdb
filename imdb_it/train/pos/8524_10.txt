The boys, aged 7 to 14, have achieved such an extraordinary result from this film that this year we have delivered a copy to all the other boys on our birthday list. Everyone loved it! Children ages 2 to 7 look repeatedly and frequently, and have a great time watching them with them. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to entertain children for so long and offer laughter for the adults, as well. Most enjoy more than the first. <br /> <br /> High quality production and an excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as superior George - athletic, energetic and completely believable, with an innocent innocence and a particular talent to take a tree in the face - well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as the evil rival, and all the others. This is fun.
