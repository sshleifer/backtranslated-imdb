In 1987 Hong Kong had given the world films such as "Encounters of the Spooky Kind" by Sammo Hung in the iconic John Woo film "A Better Tomorrow", "Zu Warriors" and the classic "Mr Vampire". Jackie Chan has had international success on video, but it was with "A Chinese Ghost Story" that the HK cinema had its first real crossover success in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western filmmakers had never seen anything like it. It was a film that took various ingredients that the HK cinema had been using for years (flying swordsman, wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural) and mixed them to create a film that was unique in its appearance, touch and execution. Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels that it generated, this is the original and best director. <br /> <br /> Siu-Tung Ching (better known as an action choreographer in films like Woo's "A Better Tomorrow 2" / "The Killer") created, under the watchful eye of legendary producer Tsui Hark, a masterpiece of fantasy / horror cinema. And with such an experienced crew at his disposal (no less than 6 martial arts coordinators) the chances that the film is anything but wonderful would be unthinkable. <br /> <br /> The montage of the amazing prolific David Wu (who wrote "The Bride With White Hair 2" and released classic titles like "A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled" and the cult song "The Club" is simply a brilliant work. His skill in fighting with the sword and tree climbing, perfectly choreographed, makes them some of the best HK cinemas ever created. Rapid, extravagant but never confusing, they are still the pinnacle of their art. The crew of the filmmakers did miracles. This is a film in which every shot is a skilfully made painting. Where wonderful sequences of midnight blue colors, wrapped in an ever-present ghostly fog, are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold. It is a film in which everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. Even the silk garments and the clothes worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the film, both in the romantic sequences and in the battle scenes that the ever-present silk runs across the screen. Even a simple scene in which Hsiao Tsing changes clothes becomes a thing of floating beauty as each skill on the set is combined to create a memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also incredible, giving another sense of the world to the forests, and the temple and the hardness to the burned and burned earth of hell full of flags for the incredible ending. Zhongwen Xi's production project deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor for the success of the film is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong films have given us music and fantastic songs that have contributed so much to the success of a sequence, but on "A Chinese Ghost Story" music is simply vital. From the opening hand, the music becomes as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is a perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells and guitars beat the action sequences with great effect, but it is in the slower, painfully romantic pieces that come into his. Here; flutes, strings and female choral effects create what are probably the best pieces of music heard in a Hong Kong film. Add to this the female voice, an extraordinarily beautiful song that plays the love of Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing, (you never see anything, but the effect is wonderful. This is a lovingly innocent love story) and yes has a brilliant example of the power a film's music can have. <br /> <br /> And of course we have the talent of acting. Leslie Cheung (`A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 'and a very popular singer) is outstanding as an innocent tax collector. His work in comic sequences (fortunately slight) is never exaggerated and his scenes with Joey Wang are interpreted with the right dose of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau's "God of Gamblers") never seemed more radiant than he do it here. She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. His portrait of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is amazing. He shows his characters the sadness for what he has become and for what he has been forced to do, but he also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes in which he attracts men to their gruesome deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma ("Mr. Vampire", "Swordsman") is as much fun as the wise, brave, but never so surly yen. It runs through a thin line between the eccentric and the annoying with practiced ease. And what so easily could have been a character that could have damaged the film is actually wonderfully fun and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and beasts? I can hear you crying. Well, they range from the rather rough but amusing stop-motion animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (resulting in a big gag running with constantly opposed attempts to munch the Tsau-shen in an unexpectedly unconscious way), to the rather unbalanced but surprisingly effective Lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and a truly exceptional thread work. Most of which, to date, has never been completed. <br /> <br /> But the most exceptional effect and creation is the killer language of the spirit of the tree. First we meet this thing with an "Evil Dead" camera effect that pushes down its victims to deliver a lethal French kiss that turns victims into zombie shells. But then he is shown in all his mad glory. It can become so large and long that it shoots through the forest after its prey, it tears through the trees, it wraps around buildings and wraps its slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks !! It can even open to reveal a mouth full of fangs! It is an extravagant idea that given the deeply romantic plot should not work. But it does, with a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So all that this represents is a classic example of Hong Kong film production. A real team work that gave us a truly innovative film. It's a film full of wit, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush graphics, wonderful music and, above all, its enduring charm, one of the most moving cinemas.
