CONTAINS SPOILER! <br /> <br /> I saw an advertisement for this on a video. Then my sister found out we had the book so I read it. I rented the video the same day I finished the book. it was very memorable as the book. The cast was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was as excellent as Helen and Rupert Graves was as hateful as Arthur. The costumes, the music and the settings are incredibly beautiful. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAD! SEE THIS <br /> <br /> On the negative side there are some sex scenes that have been added and some violence. This is why the video is rated 15. There are some other things that have been thrown. After the first part, I felt the accuracy went downhill. While the book is better than this, I'm glad to have seen it and would recommend it to people who have read the book, are fans of Bronte or like costumed dramas (I'm all three!) As long as you keep making your way through sex scenes. The book is rather underrated. The books by Anne Brontes do not seem to be very read or well known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights which have become television and film several times. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion there was in it, but here they had cut everything out! <br /> <br /> 7
