If you've ever wondered why they don't do porn with a plot, look at Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give Armstrong the credit for both making the effort to capitalize on this idea and using a cast so strong for adults to put some power behind. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes apparent why most porn never has more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue connecting sex scenes together. These people simply cannot act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame in a ridiculous way). Anyway, I gave a 7 because it was a nice attempt and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners. Also, I'd like to see more attempts like this. Maybe someday I'll see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
