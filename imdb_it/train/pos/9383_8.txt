From the director of "Last Seduction" and "Kill me again", comes another film in a noir style. John Dahl created a niche for himself by making films on adultery themes, blackmailing in the early 1990s. Although I didn't have much opinion about the last seduction. But nowadays Mr. Dahl has made use of directing television shows. It's a shame since the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ** This is a rather impressive film that revolves around a Cage vagabond who arrives in the city of Wyoming for a job. However, he is not lucky and is mistaken for a Texas hired assassin by the owner of the J.T. Walsh bar. He is given the task of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split after taking the advance payment without doing it. While leaving the city, he accidentally hits a guy on the street, who then returns to the local hospital. Then Cage meets Walsh again, who appears to be the local sheriff. Afterwards Cage escapes from his clutches, but meets with the real killer who is Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl wrote and directed this film. So it goes to show that a project can be decent when a director puts his thoughts on the screen. The direction is good, but while watching the film I had a feeling with TV. There were too many close-up frames. However this does not prevent the film from being a pleasant experience. The film had a good rhythm and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a good duration of the duration. <br /> <br /> Cage played the role of a vagabond realistically, even though for me his performance seemed a little subdued. His facial expressions were on target. Lara Flynn Boyle was warm and managed her part perfectly like the femme fatale. His hairstyle was far away and he could make any boy fall on his knees. Hopper did his part well. But I feel it was a mixture for this role. He didn't convince me that he had the qualities of a hit man. The role was not written with his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> During the visualization you will get a deja vu of previous films like "The Hot Spot" and "A Perfect Murder". Due to the fact that some secondary plots are similar. Overall if you are a fan of film noir then this is for you. Worth recommending. 7/10
