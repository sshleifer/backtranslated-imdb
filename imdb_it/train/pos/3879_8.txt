A typical Clausen movie, but again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and interprets one of the main roles. This is really a great movie about normal people who live normal lives trying to make the best of it. The 4 primary actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is really an actor, but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old. <br /> <br /> Everyone has problems and those that no one believes ends up being happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to struggle to win their life and love.
