Maybe it's not the most original way of telling a story, we've already seen all this in many movies .. but .. I really enjoyed October Sky anyway. He has something, great direction and good acting from everyone, especially Laura Dern (the teacher) and Chris Cooper (the father). I want to be a missile engineer! :)
