Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this episode of MOH. Those who know the basic archetypal stories on which most of the classic EC comics were based will immediately recognize this. <br /> <br /> Preferred indie underrated Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays of APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOME YOU) are the kind of guy whose attractive look for every man can go either way. He could play a boy next door, very nice but misunderstood, or he could play the same role with a disturbing background of unpleasant corrosiveness. In the case of the RIGHT TO DIE, take the second approach, and it certainly works. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who has recently had a relationship with his piggy receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, ruthless spouse, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them are involved in a terrible car accident while returning from a fruitless weekend of "preparation" and is horribly burned in a fire, she is reluctant to pull the plug from her, not without some exciting tripping from her even thinner lawyer and best friend (Corbin Bernsen, looks worse for wear these days.) <br /> <br /> But Abbey has never been one to give up without a fight, and that's where the EC theme of the episode comes into play . Cuddled husbands - and wives - have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some hilarious (and OOKY) supernatural intrigues, and this case is no exception. If nothing else, the rampant sex and blood quotient must have Bill Gaines shouting for joy in his mausoleum somewhere. <br /> <br /> And not to mention the fact that the original screenplay by John Esposito gives the corner of adultery only a slight twist. You do not realize while you are watching that you only know half the story, until the end ... (think WHAT IS BEING SAYED with more guts and gazongas, and you are there.) <br /> <br /> It is not a bad effort, but not the best either. At least Rob Schmidt shows touches of talent here and there with management, especially in a scene that makes messaging with cell phone photos a truly terrifying experience! As with most MOH episodes, this follows a prevalent theme in this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely finicky need does not apply.
