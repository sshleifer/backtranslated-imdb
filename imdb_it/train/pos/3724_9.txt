Tigerland follows the lives of a group of men recently enlisted in the army who were called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, America knows they are fighting a lost battle, and the director takes a 16mm portable documentary film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a character studio without a real plot, but focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a senseless but intelligent man, who just wants to escape the field. We are brought through different characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I should say that this is a great story about Vietnam and more important about the army in general. Great acting, and very memorable. Even the filmmakers use film and the style works so well, because it looks a lot like the old movie you always see on Vietnam. It's nice to see how the film shows that all the internal struggles and problems have been so significant for the problems related to the battle. The particular scene in which Boz moves away from a training mission in which an instructor shows how to use a radio as a torture device, summarizes in a few words everything about war ... and it's useless. <br /> <br /> Fantastic film Not only on Nam, but on whom individuals must decide what is morally right being "in the army". <br /> <br /> Rated 9 out of 10.
