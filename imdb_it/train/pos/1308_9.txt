I have to say that I really had no idea that I would sit and watch this movie. I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between lessons. But, for once, a TV movie caught my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I wasn't a big fan of her before this movie. Of course, I liked Twister and As Good As It. But something about this movie really did it for me. Now I would see myself as a big fan. This movie has a high score from ... me. Give it a chance, it won't disappoint you.
