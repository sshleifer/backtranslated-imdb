The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie, we were watching him for Alex Winter's "Bill & Ted's" fame. We didn't know what to expect except to whom and what it was. <br /> <br /> When the film was finished, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, although not completely accurate historically, was and is the best of its kind. I have seen other films that describe the history of this famous summer and, in my opinion, none of the others can compare. It bent a little in certain details, but those parts did not take away the elegance and romanticism of the story. I've seen the other films this summer and I find that most of them are good, but none as exciting as this. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has the qualities of a painting. The colors and settings seem to be something you could find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's house. The costumes were fantastic and, although they weren't the most comfortable clothes in the world, they made me want to find a dressmaker to create such a dress for me. The whole film is set on the picturesque Lake Geneva (where I hope to see this film someday) and the serenity that these historical figures have found there. <br /> <br /> This film shows, in addition to the tranquility found by all the fugitives of severe English judgments, the strangeness that also surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice during that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And the taking of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was medicinal as well as recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered the pain of a beaten foot. It was not surprising that there would be prescriptions for the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer. And they were poets at a time when experience was the key. There was no time for prudent prudence. Passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. And out of the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy the creation of a legend was born: "Frankenstein". <br /> <br /> Yes, in this film we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at that time) played by the beautiful and talented Alice Krige. It is the controlling factor for everything that happens until she too yields to experience. But she maintains her position and experiences things on her terms. Like the strength he inherited from his mother and father. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. The appropriate music. The management captured the essence of summer, as I read about it. This film is based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author collects the story from what she was able to put together from the magazines of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even small inaccuracies from time to time) and romanticism and gothic, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the monster's birth, which still teaches us the morality of "playing God". <br /> <br /> A must-see movie!
