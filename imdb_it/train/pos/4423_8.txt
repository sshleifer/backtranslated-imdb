At first GOJOE is getting a little used to it, but the end result is very satisfying. The story, about a killer samurai trying to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. There is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The film might seem a bit similar to other Samurai movies inspired by anime at first, but eventually it will enter a more mature / adult territory shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. GOJOE is one of the best samurai films for post-Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the film and reviews of other foreign films)
