This film has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this film for the first time a week ago, since then every day I see the opening and every time I feel happy as I heard the first time I heard David Niven utter the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh's The Walter Pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> Give me my shell of silence, my personal faith to walk on, my step of joy, immortal diet, my bottle of salvation, my garment of glory, the true caliber of hope ; And so I take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a real truism to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger are fully justified for creating such a wonderful opening? Because they had already been admitted to the Poets' Paradise long before they made this film. <br /> <br /> I guess they both face judgment during doomsday and carelessly say to an angry God: Excuse me, sir. So, do you want to know what we did during our life? Well, you'll see: we wrote direction and product: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes ?? do you think enough Sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature, the Muse or whatever you can call when they were shooting at a question of life and death. The fact that the lives of others would be justified for their actions may not be obvious to everyone, although I feel that my life would have a meaning if I had never done anything else to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course veterans will be tempted to say: they don't make films like this anymore. They will be partially in error; they haven't even made films like this in the past. <br /> <br /> I have already mentioned Keats here, but I will repeat his words: A beautiful thing is a joy forever.
