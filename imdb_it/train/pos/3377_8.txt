Soylent Green is a classic. I waited for someone to do it again. It seems that they are redoing the science fiction classics of these times (ie War of the Worlds) and I hope that some director / producer will remake Soylent Green. With today's animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a great image. Anti-utopian films may not be so far-fetched. The human race generates as cockroaches without external influence to reduce it. We, as human beings, have the possibility of putting the kibosh on the procreation of minor species if they get out of hand, but there is nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc., the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a Petri dish. The classical Malthusian economy states that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing .... it is obscene.
