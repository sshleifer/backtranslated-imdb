Diane and I saw this fabulous movie today in Fremantle and we both agreed that the pastiche films were head and shoulders above the rest. I say this because we were entranced by the short segments of five to ten minutes that made up the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and, of course, that theme was love in its many forms. > <br /> Apparently the film took place in the various Parisian arrondissements, giving each segment a special flavor. Having been to Paris only several times, I was not sufficiently informed to readily recognize the locations, but I am sure that the Europeans and in particular the French could easily recognize the city locations. In any case, the viewer is immediately involved in every story because of their productive excellence, so these places in the city vanish accordingly. <br /> <br /> The film moves quickly and the viewer is left to absorb a scenario while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic like Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and stimulating and kind as with most life without the media area hiding so much beauty of life under the nearest manure just to sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and give this little magic movie a chance to get wet like a spa treatment and when you leave my hypothesis you'll feel renewed.
