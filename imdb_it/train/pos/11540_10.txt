This is Neil Simon's piece of work that has received much praise! "The Odd Couple" is a unique gem. You got Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, fussy ordinary freak, and a big thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total lousy. These men have great jobs though. Felix is ​​a journalist and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced, Felix's wife is close, while the Oscar is on the other side of the United States (The West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living together on the same roof without going mad are impossible and unlikely. It's a lot of laughs and lots of fun. I liked the part where when those two British neighbors talking to both gentlemen, and after Oscar hunted Felix, he's lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night before. It's time for Felix to need to lighten up. I imagine all the horrifying ones are ordered to lighten up. They may be fussy, yet they should be patient as well. A very funny film and a nuevo classic. "The Odd Couple" by Neil Simon is a classic movie not to be missed. 5 STARS!
