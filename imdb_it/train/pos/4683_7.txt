(Question) What are the names of 100 film critics buried up to their necks in the sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I don't know Peter Mattei from Adam, but if he's the budding author his filmography suggests, "Love in the Time of Money" is a "good start". A classy shot with extravagant music box style music, this film looks at a chain of muted relationships as you move from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ending with people A & B in the carousel. The film softly probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely represented nuances that begin and end with a street whore and her client. The downside of this film is the lack of a story that could have something to do with the many critical mistakes it has received. I saw the "Angels in America" ​​behemoth last night and I got bored at the end while this little chain of character studies kept me spellbound. Be careful. I could be the only person who really enjoyed this movie. (B)
