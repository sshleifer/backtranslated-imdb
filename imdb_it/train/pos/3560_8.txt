Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by many today as one of the best directors in the history of Hollywood, but this film shows that it is. Already a success by making sophisticated American dramas like A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve and successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a wonderful job of bringing this Broadway movie to success and does it in style. Marlon Brando is as perfect as Sky Masterson, although he can't sing too well. He is the only actor who can do it perfectly with his coldness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great skill. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very fun way. However, most of the credit should be attributed to Mankiewicz for having brought a refined musical to his own right to the screen in such a way as to be authentic in many scenes but it is nevertheless a story in his world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels that you normally shouldn't have.
