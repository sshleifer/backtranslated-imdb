I wonder what the audience thought of the day when they laid eyes on Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly it does not seem most often, that skull face, the crushed nose and the elongated body ... even now it remains a disturbing presence. And what could be more appropriate than its emergence from those squalid New Orleans slums that seem to haunt like the plague that Blackie is losing in the city. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very cleverly assembled ?? the black morgue humor, the Widmark-Douglas interaction, the un-touristy places, the battles among the officials are all intertwined in a very realistic thriller with a threat different from the others of the time. Even Widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the marquee aren't too disruptive. The director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for stamping a product in the studio (Fox), no matter how much he may have heard about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark does a solid low profile job as a public health official. But my money is on the only Zero Mostel. There has never been a more robust performer who could scream louder or be pushed more around than the bulky type (eg The Enforcer, 1950). That scene with Mostel, in which Palance discusses with the cunning wife of Mostel (Liswood), is a jewel of unbridled submission while Mostel tries to pacify everyone like a bizarre pinball. Too bad I lost so many years on the blacklist. (I wonder if the fickle Kazan named him.) <br /> <br /> But it's not just the professionals who add color. The locals add character and authenticity, especially the two Asian boys interviewed by the police. That whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized its potential and built a small elegant scene on the spot. Furthermore, that colorful recruitment room with all the hands of the deck is pure inspiration. And what about those smoky cafes that make me run to the nearest Denny's. <br /> <br /> However, the film is still a well-organized and compelling thriller with an apocalyptic air that strangely anticipates many of today's mega-blows.
