I liked this movie. He was cheerful, delicious and very colorful. You can see that MGM showed Technicolor. There are very few colors that do not appear in this film. Every scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a marvel. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film, the sequence of the great dance, is truly impressive. What makes this film very special is the music of Gershwin. Few American composers have had a better gift for the melody. I really like Gershwin's music. Is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is certainly one of the greatest writers of texts. It's so witty and fascinating. This was a very funny movie.
