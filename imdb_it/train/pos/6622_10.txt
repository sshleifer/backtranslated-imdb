I just went to a screening of the film during Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief presentation. The film fell apart and from the first shot I was amazed: a long continuous shot of a futuristic Paris in a glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I shouldn't go on with the details because I think it's a movie to see. Science fiction history could be found in the media for many ... for me it was really good. The action is exceptional, the camera is free to fly anywhere and I mean anywhere. The things you would not be able to do or see are beautifully realized. The cast performance is good, in my opinion no one took the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now, the thing that I found great is the animation. 3D graphics in 2D. A cartoon in BW format brought back to life. The details on the backgrounds give more consistency as if they were made by hand (I'm sure it was, but when they change angles, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, he said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was rather inexperienced since he only had a short film on his CV. So many people had a true faith in them. They started their study from scratch and since they faced the challenge they brought about them. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. I think you won't regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater for the final appearance of this film is superior to his belief.
