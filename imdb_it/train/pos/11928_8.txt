This film, although apparently based on a film of the same title published in 1951 by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great film. Danny Glover, in one of his best performances, brings George Knox, an unfortunate baseball manager with an irascible temper, to life. Regarding the fact that this film is "stacked", what to say about the addition of Christopher Lloyd (his theatrical experience works and shows through his on-screen performances, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun), Brenda Fricker (charming and well-seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, he is also good in this film), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be so important in this film, but got visibility), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except for Dazed and Confused), some great actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and an experienced veteran of one of his last performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of California Angels), and the rest of the cast do a great job, in addition to a fantastic plot ch and it is uplifting for a lot of people, I don't care what the recesses of depression are. I loved this movie as a child, and it brings me back to my memory when I look at it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to all parents who are looking for something their children have not seen, and all the others, for that matter.
