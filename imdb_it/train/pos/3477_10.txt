some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined .. i don't agree at all.the quality of the shows didn't go up or down and scrappy, you win my opinion, like great chrecter.i watched a survey on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said that the second set of scrappys was ruined by scoobys. OK, so the loads said yes but 28% can't go wrong yet. I like the way most episodes focus on comedy. I think the show would have become rubbish if it had been the same 5 person / dog that solves the mystery in the same formula. Scrappy was a breath of fresh air for the show.sure, some people tuned in but when scrappy were introduced observe the DOUBLED figures. Back to the show. All the episodes and segments were a lot of fun. I was intrigued by the yabba and shorts. But at the end of the day it's a matter of opinion whether you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion, there is certainly no fact. But in my OPINION this was a superb series that gave a start to tires showing a new formula and a new lease of life. Nuff said.
