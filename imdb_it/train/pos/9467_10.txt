I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE by the excellent reviews and the thirst of a well written Dramedy - thanks to you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell acted in the film, you know that an audience will find like in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a very fun and rewarding performance. DAN IN REAL LIFE has delivered this promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so real for many families around the world who have lost a member and moved on with their lives in search of something that will restore their magic before their loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so well done and written that their scenes were so real for their characters and their travels. The cast, the sets and the plot have made DAN IN REAL LIFE to be remembered as we head towards future vacations.
