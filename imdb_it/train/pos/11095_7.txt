I've always liked this John Frankenheimer movie. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why this was not just another thriller is due to Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to small details make the difference, he also hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can create a case that is the last successful film made by Roy Scheider. I have always said that Robert Trebor gave an exceptional performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and is also excellent, but I really thought that Trebor was distinguished. Frankenheimer may not be proud of this film like the others, but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors that appear in squalid parts. What can you say about a movie where Ann Margaret is raped with drugs and raped? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a really seedy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploitative thriller that should not be forgotten.
