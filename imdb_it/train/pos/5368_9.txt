This is a fantastic action movie with a large Arnie liner! It is done with style, with a lot of action to keep it satisfied. The Characters were fantastic and Richard Dawson is very threatening as the main villain. Yes, it has a lot of holes in the plot, but it's extremely fun, with a fantastic ending. He also had a good story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had a great chemistry together. The character development was also quite good, with some excellent performances. The direction is great! Paul Michael Glaser does a great job here, with a fantastic use of colors, keeping it elegant in everything, fantastic camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. There's a bit of cold blood. Let's take some bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, cut throat, bloody chainsaw slices, dead skinless bodies, blood and an impaling one. The acting is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department, he has tons of hilarious, a kick, and as always he is a great physical presence! And it was fun to watch! (Arnie's Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, is good here, she was really nice and had a good feeling with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, he is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, he is as good as a genius, he was fantastic! Richard Dawson is fantastic as the main villain, and he was very threatening, and he was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they need to do very well as stalkers. Overall it's a must see! **** 1/2 on 5
