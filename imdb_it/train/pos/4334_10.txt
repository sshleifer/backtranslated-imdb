Who wouldn't want to travel with Peter Falk? That man's right eye has more character than most of today's actors. This is the kind of funny and moving film we are all looking for as a counterweight to all the bizarre monsters of special effects. The women will love him for all the romantic tips of wake up for men, and the men will love him for his spot-on character / character studio of the father / son - one big scene after another. And it has only one advantage to be a real indie discovery. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it means to be both a father and a son, as well as having both laughter and tears as he moves through life. The fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. It could be said that both his character came to a new appreciation of his father and another actor who really enjoyed Peter Falk's special trade. Really delicious We hope that this film will soon arrive in theaters all over the country so that everyone can have the chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and the people.
