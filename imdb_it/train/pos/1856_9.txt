He has glorified himself as a great supporting actor in "Glory", he has proven not to be a "mediocre actor of Malcolm in the Middle" in "Malcolm X", he showed his brotherly love for acting in "Philadelphia", he pulled a slap in 'He Got Game', he didn't throw punches and he shook us like a hurricane in "The Hurricane", he provided us with an effective theatrical education in "Training Day", and now he has shown he can also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut "Antwone Fisher" is the most moving film of the year. This tear-jerking story has nothing to do with the defeat that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the dolphin tragedy, "Antwone Fisher" has a joyful conclusion and exciting. The film is based on a true story of a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abomination he suffered as an adopted son. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome anger and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I've seen from a novice actor for some time now. Actually I saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting, as I saw in past performances in Washington. It was as if Washington was telling Luke- "la la la Luke that I'm your acting father". Ok! I will leave the Star Wars lines before my readers send me to a faraway galaxy. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the same "Maestro D" who plays. "Antwone Fisher" was written by Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos that he included in the script of his storylife was of "real fisherman" material. I greet the chief `Mr. Washington 'in taking the right bait in' Antwone Fisher '. ***** Excellent
