Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. He has made numerous commercials and commercials here in Canada. Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. The support case also looks pretty good. Now I've seen the pilot several times and still find it refreshing. However, I'm not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I could be wrong) But as far as I know, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It's a new idea and I hope it's good. Too bad that this cannot be coupled with Corner Gas. Now I know that the Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would be great pieces to accompany.
