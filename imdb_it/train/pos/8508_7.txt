Richard Dix decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place playing the role of Ted Nichols who meets a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple had only known each other for two days and decided to marry a Justice of the Peace (Judge) and it is raining heavily when they arrive at the Judge's house and discover that he is not at home and will not return before the next day. While the couple is inside the house, they see someone lift the hood of their car and take a part of the car from the engine. Once you see this event, you realize that this couple has a great surprise and that the story will reveal a very mysterious event surrounding Alice Barkley and poor Ted Nichols starts with a lot of trouble and no marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. To enjoy.
