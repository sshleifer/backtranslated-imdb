I agree with the comment above, I love realism in this, and in many films (not just films about eating disorders) the producers seem to forget it. They take a problem every day and create an extremely dramatic scene and then they come to the end of the film everything is perfect again, which I don't like because it's not reality. It does not mean to say that things cannot improve, and it does not mean saying things that are not in this film, but does not spend most of the film creating all these problems, and at the end of the film everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people don't admit it and they want to improve, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and I like how in this film we grow with the characters, we face the difficulties with them, getting better and better, because it is a very important part of the film. It enters the minds of people with eating disorders and shows complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and I loved it. I also like how it manifests. The secrecy and betrayal that people experience when they suffer from eating disorders, it's scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve. I thought this film was very touching, beautiful and well told, and provocatively one of my favorites.
