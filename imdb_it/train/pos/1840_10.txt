Great script and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the lone wolf police detective a new dimension of intensity and, above all, credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood cop hero loses his family, friends and pets to kill him he is usually given his minute of pain. But when the sixty seconds are over, he gets back on his feet, packs his gun and cheerfully shoots his enemies one by one. <br /> <br /> Marc Ferrot of Montand, however, is really devastated - by his killer friends, of course, but also by discovering that she had another lover. In his confusion and anger he does not seek revenge but he needs to go on to find the true author of a crime in which his fingerprints are everywhere. So all his actions inevitably become logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks to our seats but it is certainly not the only one.
