This film is simply fantastic. It's fun from beginning to end, you'll always be at the edge of your seat during the entire movie. In my opinion this film is very undervalued by the critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of the well-trained alpine rescue boy Gabe Walker. Together with him Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best interpretations I've seen of him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the film takes place in a mountain with lots of villains on it leaves plenty of room for action! <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie!
