Well, if you're one of those Katana movies (just like me), you'll surely enjoy this metaphysical Katana who spits bloody blood with samurai action. <br /> <br /> Interpreted by Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) and Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between the Heiki clan and the Genji clan touches the zenith in the final clash at the Gojo bridge. The number of bodies is infinite. <br /> <br /> Demons, magical swords, Shinto priests and Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by master Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese film for a rainy summer night.
