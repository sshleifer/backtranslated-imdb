As they pay, I must say that this film has a small or non-existent magickal meaning. It is a funny "witchcraft" film and does not aim to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magic of all, and never to use it in a controlled or vengeful way. This is a lesson that everyone must learn, not just the Pagans. <br /> <br /> That said, this film is wonderfully written and sweetly played by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold offers an extraordinary performance like Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many film titles to mention, except as Ms. Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was as wonderful as her neighbor of Mrs. Novak, distracted and upstairs at the same time. Also starring Jack Lemmon (splendid performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly witty). <br /> <br /> "Witches can't cry because they can't shed a single tear because their hearts are full of Magick. Don't have time for silly things like love." Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are witches of Manhattan. Deeply cloaked in the secret subterranean world of those of Craft, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without even causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then, comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a busy, resolute, unscrupulous businessman who is engaged to Gillian's old college rival. <br /> <br /> From a bizarre setback, he finds himself moving into Gillian's building and is immediately "charmed" by his charm and grace. With the help of Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (Gillian's familiar, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian starts working on this beautiful dream man to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to check or hurt, and Gillian learns it in the most bittersweet way. Not only must he face what he did, but he must face Shep in his guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical point of view; however, the film takes a serious turn: the effects are very dated to the point of being a pure encampment. Some of the landscapes were apparently filmed in the basement of someone's small house, but at least the characters were bizarre and funny. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a note of curiosity, this is the root of Bewitched's beloved television sitcom. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All the note characters are present and accounted for. You just have to watch, see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites, and I watch it often. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
