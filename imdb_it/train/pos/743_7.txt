This work is striking for its accurate representation of adolescent life at the time of its execution. Although this is a general generalization, the parents of that time were too self-absorbed to be real parents, and those who were at home tended to be too distracted by real problems, where their children were worried. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us how to let go, even when it is painful, and does so with a sweet, melancholy, but informed style, in which Foster philosophically speaks of feeling the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was my favorite scene from the movie, actually. <br /> <br /> The transition from the funeral to the wedding was designed to show that life continues, and so do we. Baio's skateboard through a pack of henchmen and overcoming them was destined to show us that difficult times will pass, and we are destined to overcome them, to better times. <br /> <br /> The whole metaphor of "going on," and the procession of life, is present throughout the film, and serves to give us hope in the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, even if I don't watch it often, because it tends to make me melancholy. <br /> <br /> It should not be seen by young children, and probably only those raised in the 70s and 80s would like. <br /> <br /> The rate is 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
