WARNING SPOILERS. This film was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the two best in it. Ok, so the foreign goofie that (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was fun. Even this guy's boss was good. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had much more screen time together. Their chemistry was fantastic. The bathroom scene: WOW! Romantic, sweet, appetizing. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a charlatan maid who saves a foreign man and ends up in the greenhouse in the middle of a plot because of politicians' greed. Talking about Sarandon would be like giving a lot. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy, and it satisfies both in some way - the political side much more than the romantic. It touches on political issues and barely touches the romantic areas. <br /> <br />
