And also a rather unexpected plot - for the era: there's Plague in the city of New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can prevent it! Elia Kazan's subjects: waterfronts, working men, crowds, fugitives, blue collar people, backstreet violence are all on display here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as the cold gangster for a big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise a bit awkward but certainly as watchable as his strong point. I liked Barbara Bel Geddes as strong and cool - I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. <br /> <br /> He himself always reminds me of a little Sinatra - in the face and in a calm and intense way - and this is meant as a compliment if nothing else. I had never heard of this film, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance. I also liked Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, they form an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The same plague is a McGuffin - and you must know that it is not exactly done as I would have been in real life - rather in small scale at least not? - but I found that it carried the plot very well. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this. All right. *** outta ****
