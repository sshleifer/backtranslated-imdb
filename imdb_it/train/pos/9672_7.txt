I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this kind of film. A bird that has suffered many "misadventures" and has not yet lost its faith in humanity and its sense of humor. The peculiarity of this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and is not used as a push for a hotshot actor. I also like the plot: Paulie tells his life to a cleaner at the point where he hit the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pesci's!). And of course Cheech Marin, the man is humorous to me. Since I saw "Up in Smoke" I appreciated his way of performing naively, making a situation simple and amusing ... I can't do it.
