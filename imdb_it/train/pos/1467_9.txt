According to Slavoj Zizek, guest and analyst of this intellectually pleasant tour de force, Groucho is the superego, Chico the ego and Harpo the id. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the films listed above are used to illustrate the concepts: the role of fantasy in shaping reality and vice versa, the father figure, male and female libido, the death instinct, etc. Here are some of Slavoj's expressions (more like paraphrases): "desire is a wound on reality", "fantasy realized is a nightmare", "music is the opium of people" (borrowing from K. Marx), "of all human emotions, anxiety is the only one that is not deceptive". Everything is enclosed by an introduction that states "don't look for your desires in the movies, instead the cinema tells you what you should want" and concludes with the filmmaker vision that "cinema is needed today in order to understand our current reality" - I say, until the censorship derails it. <br /> <br /> The three-part division is purely mechanical, possibly with a television screening in mind. For those who make theater it is irrelevant.
