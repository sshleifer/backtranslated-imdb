From the first scene, I was really excited. "I can say it will be fantastic!" I thought. The acting was so good, I felt like I was putting these people's lives down. The music was also exquisitely disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event and then moved forward (one could perceive) towards an irrevocable destiny. The build was slow, but personally I love this kind of thing, as long as the silent tension stays on track and isn't derailed before it's ready to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> So everything is going well, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. "WHAT?!!!" it was all that my night movie partner and I could say. If you understand the director's intentions, the blunt ending makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the film, take a look at the very fascinating and funny interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can't do without to say it was not pulled out well enough. <br /> <br /> This could probably have been solved with less than ten minutes of material before the climax. In any case, it's a pity. Those ten minutes could have made a difference in the world. (But for those of you who don't write or make films, you should know that creating a narrative arc with the right timing is a huge pain in the ass, and I'm certainly not doing this criticism from any kind of pedestal!) <br /> < br /> Wendigo seems to me a masterpiece that was abandoned before it was finished. But hay, I'd like to take a blunt masterpiece every day on a piece of dog poop too over-compensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some of the monstrous scenes left me confused as to whether I should be scared or laughing. I don't know how to explain it, but there was a distinctive feature of Monty Python towards this monster in its most "monstrous" forms. While this may seem like a terrible criticism for a horror film - I don't know, it still worked for me in a distorted way. I will never look at deer horns the same way again! :)
