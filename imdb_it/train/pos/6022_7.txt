Zabriskie Point, often misunderstood, is the political film by Antonioni, the American film by Antonioni. Stylistically, it follows the example after "Blow-Up", which means that the rhythm is faster than previous epics, although certainly no less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. It is not so. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists come from very different environments. Mark from the young "rebels", Daria of a real estate agency company. But in the real Antonioni fashion, they are both alienated, both trying to escape from their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting between rebellious students and Black Panthers disappointed with empty wordy rhetoric, while Daria continues to move with her car. <br /> <br /> Antionions, the master conductor, after retracing the confused and shallow rebel young man, then moves to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, advertising on billboards, insignificance, which must continue to expand to accommodate the similar expansion of the population, while generating a profit at the same time. It is this environment from which the two protagonists escape, even if it seems mostly coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Daria stops by a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is just as stifling, and people as lost cases, best exemplified by an old boxing champion, now reduced to shadow of himself, sitting drinking, smoking and talking nonsense. An extraordinary melancholic sequence, made even more powerful by the inclusion of some wild half children who live around, brought by some "benefactor" but "destroying an authentic piece of American history". In a not so obscure symbolism, there is the opinion of Antonioni on the hippies. Only a semi-positive look on the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then there is the desert, the landscape used for devastating effects, in turn pure and terrifying, primordial, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two protagonists make love, "united" in the fantasy by the "flower" generation reflects the similar sequence in "Red Desert", where Giuliana tells her son a story. It is a colored range in a colorless landscape. A vivid semi-fantasy in a suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of the great finals of the cinema, Western civilization exploded into pieces. A catharsis, an exorcism. <br /> <br /> The two "international" films of Antionioni (the British "Blow-Up" and the American "Zabriskie Point") are minor efforts compared to the previous masterpieces, but this is largely due to the rhythm faster and inevitably contrived settings (swing in London, flower America). But when it comes to doing so, it is clear that he has not lost the advantage.
