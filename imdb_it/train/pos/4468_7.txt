Two sailors are on vacation - Sir Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and the innocent shy Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There's more but you probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so beautiful and healthy - it becomes annoying fast enough. This film is too long too. It's 140 minutes and it's too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. However it is worth catching it. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Grayson are singing, this becomes magical. None of the songs is particularly memorable, but Sinatra has such a beautiful voice that you won't be interested. It is shot in Technicolor rich with all the MGM gloss. The acting is OK - Kelly is fine (although seeing him as a gentleman is pushing him) and Sinatra is just fantastic (although seeing him as a shy boy was pushing him too!). Grayson has nothing to do but is incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of her literally took my breath away! There are many highlights here: the large number of Sinatra and Kelly dances and songs; Sinatra sings everything; Grayson's two songs and the famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom also makes a fun cameo. Also there is little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he finds himself in. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot doesn't hold up but it's still worth being captured. This was a great success in his time.
