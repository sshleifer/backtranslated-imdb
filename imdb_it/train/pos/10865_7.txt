This movie is a lot of fun to watch if you love movies of the variety of organized crime. Those in search of a detective film that has a charismatic protagonist with the dream of taking over in a bad way might be a little disappointed with the way this film proceeds. <br /> <br /> you are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, so you may be pleasantly surprised by this. I was a little disappointed with some of the choices made regarding the plot, but overall a good crime film. Some things made no sense, but that seems to be the norm with films from the Orient. <br /> <br /> People behave randomly regardless of how their personalities have been set. It's a slightly annoying model that also permeates this film.
