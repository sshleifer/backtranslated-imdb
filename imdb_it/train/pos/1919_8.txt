I did not read the book on which this was based / inspired. Being some (the others are film roles) the latest work by John Ritter (RIP), hopefully it's fun. And this is. Almost every time he is present in this, actually. Most of the cast, both supportive and normal, play each other well, and the material tends to be exceptional. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical boy of that age, Kerry, the mediocre depressive who fights for causes and awareness, and Bridget, the fashion and popular lover. Sagal returns to being the female lead in a sitcom, and her character is very far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed a little after Mr. Three's Company passed and, for a while, they couldn't make up their minds whether they wanted to get laughter, or be touching and make sure they were respectful. One wonders how and why it lasted for so long: it might still be good enough, some of the additions were lucky (if you like David Spade, most of his part is that he's doing his schtick) and has something to say. My personal favorite episode is last season. Humor is a nice mix of "stupid" jokes (mainly related to high schoolers), stupidity, dark comedy and raw material. This concerned sex and other topics for adults, but never in a graphic way. The tongue is mild and occasionally moderately strong. I recommend it to all fans of those who made it. 8/10
