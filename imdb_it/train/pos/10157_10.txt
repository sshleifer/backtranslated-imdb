This is a funny look at the Gospel presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and also tells a little. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is pretty funny. Also notice the blonde representation of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blond hair ...? However, it is a fun presentation of the biggest and most important story of all.
