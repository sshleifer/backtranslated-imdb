WAQT is a perfect example of chicken soup not really for your soul. The broth has unfortunately lost its true taste thanks to all the excessive dilutions and seals that have ended. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing about WAQT is that it comes from a director who has not approached the usual clich√©s of Hindi cinema in his first adventure but which in his second release gives up all the stereotypes of film formulas. While Vipul Shah had the conviction of showing something unlikely as the blind who steal a bank in AANKHEN, fails to induce life in the entire packaging of WAQT based on something conceivable as a parent-child relationship. Adopted by a Gujarati in the role of Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a sensible storyline with a supportive social message. A mature look at the father-son relationship, the father's unconditional love for his son and the responsibility of the child towards his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan) who created his entire empire from scratch leads a wealthy life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never had the need to fight for anything, since he got everything tailored and nurtured with the spoon in life. Ishwar's cuddles only ruined him further. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar but does nothing to make her dreams come true. Meanwhile he marries his ladylove Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still at her best, leading a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The resistance limit eventually collapses when Ishwar expels Aditya from his home. The sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now unexpected wife baffles Aditya. He has no choice but to fight for the sustenance of his wife and his unborn child. He begins to transform into an independent man but the break in the relationship between him and his father grows. <br /> <br /> The story is simplistic while the uncomplicated script has a very basic approach. You can easily identify and relate to the believable characters of the father and son. If you are not one of the two, at least you may have met people like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to it the easy management of the script by the director Vipul Shah. With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added tons of melodrama in the proceedings under the film laws of Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive tear gas. However Shah excels in effortlessly managing emotions for most of the film. <br /> <br /> The clear example of its unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre-interval scene in which the father expels his son from his home in a rather frivolous way. The purpose of the scene is achieved without staining the weight of the audience's brain. Ditto for the scene in the second half where the now separated father son has an irreverent conversation. This is what distinguishes WAQT from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an EK RISHTAA and in effect places it at a high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the points of distinction, one can wonder where WAQT still fails in the? The problem lies in the fact that while WAQT differs from the others in its series in terms of treatment, it yields to defects in terms of packaging. What with the director who forcing into song-n-dance from time to time in the first half. There is a song by Johar kinda shaadi, a Chopra kinda Hop song, a father son disco dandia song, a dream song and a dream that becomes a song that induces sufficient yawns in the viewer. Imagine this ... the father has just ousted his son from his home and his son is dreaming of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! Out of reason! and the public Out of place. <br /> <br /> The film drags on in the first half and the true story begins only in the second half. The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much-discussed sequence of dog pursuits is not bad, but it is not redeeming either. However, the taandav dance of Akshay Kumar is simply ridiculous. Imagine that you qualify for the star hunt in the movie with this histrionic (unintentionally) hilarious. Add to it the climax set in the star hunt finals where the child explodes with emotions. It's so archetypal! Even the editing model could have been reversed to hide the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son. Anu Malik's music is fine even if it is not necessary in the process. The work with Santosh Thundiiayil's camera is quite competent, though not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has come up with some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> The tricks of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav or the light moments of the film are very efficient. While Rajpal Yadav has exaggerated his comic histrionics in many films lately, this time he underestimates his character and is completely sober. His impassive expressions are perfectly complimented with Boman's exaggerated histrionics. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing in her mother's role. It should not be considered a censorship, but it is impeccable both in playing and in searching for his character. Priyanka is beautiful and plays her part well. <br /> <br /> Obviously the main applauses deserve Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is particularly expressive in the scene where the loving father scolds him intentionally to make him aware of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan is a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes, his brilliance strikes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> To sum up, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe is not so appetizing in any way.
