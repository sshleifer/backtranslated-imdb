A sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths while getting ready for their weddings. The former policeman and public school teacher fall in love with each other in this fantastic New York setting, even if they are marrying other people. Perhaps a little trivial as the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the boys - sell the corner of Natasha Henstridge and the girls - sell them the romance, everybody wins!
