Debut director Tom Kiesche turns into a winning film in the spirit of the cut, dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, it tasted of Brother Coen's first film, Blood Simple ... and launched some Monty Python aromas! He needs to see more than once to appreciate all the elements that bring a scene to the next. Expect other positive things from this author-director-actor.
