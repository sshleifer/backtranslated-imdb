One thing I've always liked about Robert Ludlum's thrillers is that when you think you understand it, it goes in a completely different direction. There are so many twists in this film that I have a headache to watch. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that it may be dependent on directing and, in this case, writing (with his brother Rick) a good story . <br /> <br /> Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep you interested even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and this will keep you interested and guessed right to the end.
