I'm sick of people whining about the Ewoks! True, they are not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they did happen, so face them! Moreover, they are nice and I don't care if they are marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited about The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly set fire to the entire story from Luke to Anakin. I love how it is revealed in the end - it would be too unresolved in any other way. So those of you who complain that Vader's helmet has been removed, take a moment to think about it. Vader is very effective, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. It's not entirely a car - it's vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I don't know how the casting director chose such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does a great job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a great job as a female model (I mean, come on! He killed Jabba even when so many others failed!). Harrison Ford - should I add anything else? <br /> <br /> Music is once again brilliant. It's so touching and meaningful when you can choose character themes in different parts of the film. The best time is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and leaps out to fight his father in the final battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What a great man! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has a lot more meaning for me because of episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in theaters (I CAN WAIT ???) and then look again at the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
