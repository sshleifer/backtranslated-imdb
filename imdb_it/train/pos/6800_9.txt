Although derived, "Labyrinth" remains the highlight of half of the half of the six-year exhibition. Finally a story allows Welling to show how he grew up as an actor. It is not easy to interpret a character who is the embodiment of "truth, justice and the American way" on a weekly basis with minimal variations. His performance, allowing him to show how one could react if he discovered that everything he knew could be a lie, was quite credible. <br /> <br /> Welling has been wonderfully up to the task. <br /> <br /> As always, Michael Rosenbaum, like Lex "handicapped", delivered, as did Kristen Kreuk as a Lana too sweet to believe. Allison Mack, the ubiquitous Chloe, also got a slightly "off-her-rocker" version. <br /> <br /> The use of an annoying buzz in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama.
