In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged brothers who live together with Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from a distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris, a veteran of the Disney short film series "Alice" who later adopted the name of her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 years old in Lucy Maude Montgomery's original novel, but the actress herself failed to pass credibly from age to college through the course of history. The film suffers a bit from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more fun coming from an eleven-year-old boy than as a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes a lot of joy in life and quickly adapts to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the film's writer chose to focus on this aspect of her character. Which has transformed the basic genre from family drama to comedy. A change that has delighted the public and continues to frustrate the purists of the reader. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the Montgomery story, I see no reason to dispute the changes, but let this serve as a warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comic element is the strength of the film as it is one of the first self-reflecting parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of the beauties of all Hollywood times and the film is in black and white. Much of the fun is seeing the endless moans of the title character on his appearance and the color of his hair contradicted by what appears on the screen. Anna regularly gives her rural nonsensical comrades with melodramatic lines such as: "If you refuse, it will be a pain for my whole life". Perhaps the funniest moment is when he corrects the spelling of his name on the classroom blackboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a good job as the love interest of Anne Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steal all the scenes in which she appears as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
