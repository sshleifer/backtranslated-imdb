Fortunately, not knowing anything about this film, I was curious enough to record it on TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the finale! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I managed to get the most of it because this is a truly exceptional spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and slightly foggy textures, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year of 1969, certain slight lesbian tones must have raised a few eyebrows. Obviously now no one is surprised and those scenes seem in fact very beautifully made. And it's not just because of George's two actresses. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit every spectator very strongly, no wonder, and it certainly struck me. Very effective. The views from both sides of the opponents also give the whole story more depth along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war story of a victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory for good and for bad. Well, being a case of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of the composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent, moving but never exaggerated. And I think I should try to capture more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! We hope they do it soon on DVD, so I can have the whole movie in my collection and more people will know about this little known gem.
