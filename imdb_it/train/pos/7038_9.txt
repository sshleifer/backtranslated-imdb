"The first war must be 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a difficult film to describe; comedy, satire, action, screwball. He remembered Dr. Strangelove one or two times, especially in the Ben Kingsley scenes (which I think he did an extraordinary job). I had no particular expectations for this film, even though I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I let the film come to me. And as a result I was quite amused. Political satire is painfully accurate and very harmful to the US military-military complex. The sub-plots were quite predictable, but the final plot of the narrative lines made them all worthy. I can understand why this film was not very popular in the United States, but for the rest of the world it is a timely story.
