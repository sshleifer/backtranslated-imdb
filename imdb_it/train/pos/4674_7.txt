What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leaves them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This film is not like that. It's a story of real people who are sometimes a combination of both nice and unlikely. <br /> <br /> Negative side: <br /> <br /> The character development is not enough and some plot lines were held in the wind. <br /> <br /> Above: <br /> <br /> Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for better or worse in their lives. <br /> <br /> Well performed by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> Contains a good carefree humor.
