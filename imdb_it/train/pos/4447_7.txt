Barbara Stanwyck gives this first soap produced by Douglas Sirk, produced at Universal, only the calcium she needs. Not as memorable as Sirk's subsequent melodramas, it is easy to see by watching "All I Desire" where Sirk will artistically head in the coming years. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in the small town of the United States, having abandoned them a decade earlier. His family and his community have mixed emotions in dealing with his shocking return. Part of the cinematography is surprising, and Stanwyck is as hard as nails and really gives this film a shot of energy. Overall, a pretty good show.
