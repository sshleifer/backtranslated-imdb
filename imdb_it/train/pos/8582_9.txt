I love the characters and the plot. Very funny with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great shows. I liked the dynamic and comic interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very nice and surprisingly understanding and destroyed killer. All three actors are among my favorites and having them in this film are made for special treatment. A nice addition to my vast DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, LA Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and, The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
