This film shows the life in northern Cameroon from the point of view of a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial government (French) and whose family is one of the few white families in circulation. It gives a sense of what life was like for the settlers and the natives with whom they were associated. It is consistent with another film I saw about Africa at a similar time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the film - but the plot is undervalued. The viewer is left to draw his conclusions rather than force him with the filmmakers, even if the framing of the story as a flashback of the visit of the woman in southwestern Cameroon as an adult provides a certain perspective.
