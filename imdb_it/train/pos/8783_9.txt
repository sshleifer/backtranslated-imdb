Gentleman Jim is not really a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn like Jim Corbett. But having said that, boxing scenes are a real revelation for modern viewers. There are no 12 rounds, decision points here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank employee who gets a shot at the world heavyweight title. Flynn adapts well to the gentle but unpredictable role of Corbett. However, his opponent John Sullivan is even better, an old school bruise played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a man who pushes for his great occasion. Corbett leaves his worldly life and builds a new character like Gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egoist. Sullivan the heavyweight champion is interpreted as a simple brute, but his honesty and sportiness lend some contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> There is action and excitement in abundance and a wonderful ending with the redemption necessary for everyone. And Errol Flynn takes the girl.
