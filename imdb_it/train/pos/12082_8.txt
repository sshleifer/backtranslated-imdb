Having observed this film strictly on the basis of the evaluations of the reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised. Although clearly low budget, it bears the marks of intelligent ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be improved with an external click focused on her face and then moved backwards to include the house and its isolated location. And here! the next scene was exactly the last shot of the house standing alone on the cliff by the sea. There are other examples of how an intelligent director can elevate his film to the level of a very entertaining thriller. The most discerning spectators will certainly see them but they should rest assured that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, George Macready is his usual eerie disturbing, barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a girl who worked without frills and who didn't want to give up without a fight. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, even made me doubt my own eyes and believe that she could get away with her evil plans. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed.
