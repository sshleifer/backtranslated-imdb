Several posters quoted Renoir expressing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is that we wouldn't all be, while the harsh reality is that only a select few have to do it. At this point in his career Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949 he left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked ahead. After five turkeys in Italy she was probably ready to open a vein, but by the end of the year, after doing this for Renoir, she had returned to her place with an Oscar for Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir made in color during this period and, on balance, is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and also with French Can Can. Renoir probably imagined that with so much success his Bergman could get by with a pair of wooden men and Renoir chose two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real accident in French history, but Renoir is content to give it lightly once and focuses on replicating his father's paintings in set up after installation. In its pastel colors it resembles another film from the Les Grandes Manouvres period which is not bad. All in all a pleasant nonsense remains on show a beautiful and charismatic actress.
