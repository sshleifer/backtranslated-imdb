BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU ARE DEAD DEBUT starts promising, creating a simple robbery that goes wrong, told from different perspectives (RASHOMON style). At about an hour, Sidney Lumet turns this film into something that is much more than the sum of its parts; eventually it turns into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the entire realm of emotions / human relationships, as the story reaches its chilling climax. <br /> <br /> As in the case of Lumet, he manages to convince shows from his star cast, with no idea of ​​over-acting or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarf Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. This does not mean that Hawke is not bad; in fact it is quite above the adequate, in a troubled role that adapts to his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she cares about her meat is added to this). The character of Albert Finney (Andy's and Hank's father) is the most intriguing and, in my opinion, deserved a little more time on the screen. Amy Ryan also does her job properly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU ARE DIED is not an exceptional film, but proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of its features and brands appear here, not least of which concerns the use of its characters. Infused with a killer script (no pun), intelligent dialog and rhythm, and a decent score, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU ARE DEAD IS A MUST-SEE. A gem really undervalued. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). I should just put my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
