I could not agree more with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. A perfect movie on a relaxed Sunday morning. The humor is subtle (exactly the opposite of "slapstick" as noted by a misguided commentator). <br /> <br /> But what always ceases to amaze me is the frequency with which I find myself wanting to return to this film again and again. I originally copied this film on VHS about 12 years ago when it was previewed on one of those free Pay Cable weekend previews (maybe HBO?). I had never heard of it before. I don't know why it wasn't marketed so well. ?? When DVDs were released in bulk, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. Moreover, even the back of the Montana desert does not damage (beautiful) things. <br /> <br /> Probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler type stuff is your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea. This film needs your full attention. Humor is mainly in the dialog box. <br /> <br /> I think my next vision will probably be my 12th. But I still know that when it comes to scenes like the one where the hoods of police cars start to explode, I'll lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!). 110% recommended.
