This is an adorable and witty film. From the use of the villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy of this film does not end after repeated visions. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would love to see Enchanted April published on DVD in widescreen format.
