Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, brought together his protagonists of "Laura" for this dramatic and harsh police drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a policeman, but this time he is hardened, cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior - "I don't hate hoods, you liked to beat them!" Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals, as his father was a scammer. He doesn't want to be "the son of Sandy Dixon", so he became a policeman, but his methods are hard and hated. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating a murder, he unconsciously hits a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so strong that he kills him. Shaken Dixon does his best to cover it up, with the intention of framing a hated criminal, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame lies with Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is estranged from her husband, but continues to attract her gambling patterns. Paine had slapped his wife, angering his father, who showed up at his son-in-law's apartment, but not before Dixon left with the corpse. Without better suspicions, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Angered by guilt, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money for a lawyer. He decides to challenge Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter to deliver to the department in case of death, confessing everything. In the end, he cannot live with the knowledge of what he has done, and allows the letter to be read by his superior and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes his love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after so many years of television darkness. Eddie Mueller, historian of the film noir, provides the comment and does a good job, but I find his claim that the public would not have grasped the importance of casting the two protagonists, since "Laura" was created six years earlier. In this regard, he is wrong because they appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years before the WTSE and the film was a box office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney have been fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is a tremendous comic relief as owner of the Martha restaurant, which extinguishes the flames between the detective and the dame. <br /> <br /> Night-time urban landscapes give the film an air of threat. Gary Merrill is great as Scalise low-life, who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("I liked your father", insults Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville brand are also fantastic. And Tom Tully is simply as moving and fun as the pop unfairly accused of Morgan. <br /> <br /> A watchable noir film with a fantastic cast.
