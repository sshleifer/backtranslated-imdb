The man who directed "The Third Man" also directed the sequence "Who Will Buy" in "Oliver!" Now this is talent. <br /> <br /> I raise my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know there are "second units" involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I suppose the quality will be out. <br /> <br /> (He shows it in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding spoilers: everyone must see Oliver for the first time sooner or later.) How many lines I have to type. <br /> <br /> Encouraging people to type too much should not be encouraged. I hope this contains the "tenth line".
