Wow! Stacy Peralta has followed Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally stunning documentary on the history of surf culture on big waves in America. By reconstructing archival footage and interviews with surfing legends together, we are transported into the bold and carefree life of the first pioneers whose pure passion for sport has generated an industry that today touches millions of lives. <br /> <br /> We know these icons and their stories that give the film its warmth. You can feel the respect that Peralta has for this group, as we listen to Greg Noll's tales moving away from a bunch of elusive beach surfers to individually challenge the 50-foot waves off Hawaii's north coast. Or Jeff Clark, who has been sailing the terrible Maverick off the coast of northern California for only 15 years before he was discovered and became the surfing destination in California. And the story of Laird Hamilton's storybook, today's surfing icon. Listening Greg Noll is reverently referring to Hamilton as the best surfer who ever sent chills up my spine. <br /> <br /> (Nol, Clark and others were present at the Sundance screenings. Noll was humbly described as an old man, surfer was deeply moved by the reception of his audience and the film, both he and Clark were funny in person as in the movie. <br /> <br /> Riding Giants pays tribute to these extraordinary athletes rewarding us at the same time with a vision of the greatness and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer, the harrowing vertical droplets required to enter in them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that surfers experience every time they face a swelling of monsters. <br /> <br /> All this and the film has more for those of us who did not live in California in the 1960s, we have an overview of the impact of surfing on American pop culture (and, to my surprise, the impact of the Gidget movie on surfing!) Peralta also intertwines in some technical aspects of this sport and history d innovation in equipment. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, I was absolutely fascinated by this movie. Peralta is claiming its title of Big Kahuna of American documentaries.
