Refreshing "lost" gem! Characterized by an effective dialogue combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to worry about what happens to them. The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins the scene of the fight against fists, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a "logical" end and a long chase on foot that silences the chases of contemporary Hollywood. You know how it will probably end, but the suspense and interest are supported for everything. The end of the hunt is one of the most realistic you have ever seen. The film seems to slow down a little over half, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion.
