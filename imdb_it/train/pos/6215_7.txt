Even though I'm not a big fan of musicals, I loved Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are so funny. Sure, they can be a little formidable, but even if you know what's going to happen, they're still very nice to look at. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed with this release. Part of this was because this movie does not have the wonderful supporting cast as you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be a little lacking, especially in the "fun" department. The stupid antics of these secondary actors have given the charm of other films that is not achieved with FOLLOW THE FLEET. Moreover, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this is more than a jerk - as his fat head puts Rogers in trouble again and again. And consequently, it's much more difficult to love him or want to see them together at the end of the film. Moreover, even if the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs don't seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special and I can't remember any of them even though I just watched the movie. While this is still a cute and deserving movie, all that is missing is the spark and magic of some of their other films. Good but far from exceptional.
