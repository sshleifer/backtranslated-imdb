Even in the 21st century, pregnancy is dangerous: women have spontaneous abortions and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult cases" department of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young is in charge, a woman brought here from prison (which crime she committed is not relevant to the plot) to give birth; is in conflict over the fact that he will have to give his baby after birth. She is in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and their pains. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the protagonist, the exceptional performance, as usual, is put on by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, showing a lot of secondary roles, and sometimes taking the lead role in the B films (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several episodes of the "Torchy" series), Farrell plays a pregnant woman who doesn't want her children, since they will get in the way. He does everything he can to meddle in the nurses, including liquor smuggling in the ward (this obviously during the days of prohibition), and drinking like a fish - apparently they had never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome in the 30s. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that, unlike most films of the early 1930s, it is not women who are idiots who intrude on heroic men - that situation is reversed, with fathers waiting that trembling jelly mounds. (Observes veteran actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "Life Begins", being one of the first talkies, treats him with a good dose of melodrama, of course, but it is a rather fascinating film. Turner Classic shows it, though rarely; I only saw him for a few days in honor of Loretta Young. But viewing is highly recommended when presented.
