Soylent Green I found an excellent film. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can best be described as "cheesy" but the story is excellent. <br /> <br /> The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very touching. <br /> <br /> In the end the mystery was not a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy and right way. <br /> <br /> The equivalent of the nearest modern day would be "Dark Angel" in terms of how the United States is shown to be a third world country.
