* Report where there are spoilers! General comments: if you can make a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will like it. Don't leave the theater because you get confused about what's going on! The film fits well into the second half. I'll take my mother to see him again when the movie officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see him at the screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will went around promoting the film. It was fantastic - he spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the picture Will! Information on Will's performance: Many times, when you see a movie with a really famous actor for some other movie / show, you always think about them in their current performance, just like you think of them for their past performances. This is not the case with Will Smith in this film. I didn't imagine the fresh prince (lol) when I was watching this movie. He was completely and utterly convincing in this very serious role. He grew immensely as an actor. I think he will at least receive an Oscar for this performance. <br /> <br /> On his character: Ben is very confrontational and tormented. It's sad ... full of feelings of guilt ... very determined, but very frightened. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, Will managed to make him live. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a good job interpreting Emily, a woman far behind her taxes. Maybe it's not the bright star that Will is in this movie, but it was very convincing. I think his character didn't have much work with Will's. <br /> <br /> Information on the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I didn't like the film until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie that was in it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it. But when things eventually adapt, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It is an extremely intense film that really attacks you. <br /> <br /> Actually it takes you a lot to see. In the theater where I was, most people cried towards the end, even adult men. When you understand what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS minor ***** That's why it's really hard to talk about the plot without give away the important things. I feel that knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. There was a lot of symbolism in the film that I liked, though. I will mention a little here (without trying to give very far). <br /> <br /> -The fish that Ben kept in his hotel room. At first, it makes absolutely no sense. There were MANY chatter in the cinema when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> - I hated Ben at the beginning of the film. In the end, I loved him and hated him. Will was so convincing. I thought Ben was a huge idiot for Ezra, a blind man who was trying to make his way in the world. The reason he treated Ezra that way also became clear later in the film. Wait for it anyway. Everything in this film: wait outside. <br /> <br /> - Ben is a basically good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive. I still don't know if he was doing what he was doing, why he was trying to get rid of his guilt, or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people but also get rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and you hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him for what he is doing to himself (as a good person), both physically and emotionally. Good work Will.
