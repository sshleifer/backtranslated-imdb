At the second viewing of this film, I like it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and a perception of life as rather ordinary and often fearful, but what raises this film to a rarely realized height is its focus on the small incidences in our lives to which we normally offer only the shortest attention span. Here the film turns into the celebration of these incidents, the meeting of a truck driver and a customer, the jogger who hears a child crying from the bushes. Dialogue, acting, casting and directing are superb. No two on all fours, no great revelations. What I observed was how the characters were alive because of their basic nature and how their lives were enriched when they were celebrated. Congratulations to all those involved in this, we need more "Grand Canyon" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
