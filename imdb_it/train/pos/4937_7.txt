This film is actually relevant even today, given the threat of bioterrorism and threats from superbugs, West Nile virus and SARS. Like a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than functional in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film that has left its mark is Jack Palance. His well-defined features and apparently increasingly open outward appearance reveal the stingy and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene through the packaging plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
