I loved this movie, and I'm one of the old people you shouldn't like, or so it seems. No, this film is not profound - who cares? These types of films never are. But strangely, there is a message in it. It is that each of us has the potential to be what we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is exceptional in this film. I always thought you had some resemblance to Katharine Hepburn. So, it's nice to see that both Hepburn and Posey have made librarian films (Hepburn is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this film an 8. It's not a great film by film standards at all, even if there are some nice shots inside. But it's incredibly fascinating and fun.
