No message. No symbolism No dark underground current. Just a wonderful melange of music, nostalgia and good fun put together by people who obviously had a lot of fun doing it. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious denials that are diminished by studies. Obviously it is worth looking at ALL the incomparable Judi Dench. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes into my library to be pulled out whenever I feel the need for a warm experience and good-natured laughter. Just a wonderful movie!
