This film is probably for you. He had an overall meditative quality from music, to beautiful photography, and listened to the often mundane things in life that Andy Goldsworthy would have said while working or between shots. If you're familiar with Buddhism, it's the kind of sense I got from this movie. The impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnection of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused and, in the end, forced me to leave without finishing (I saw more than an hour) was the redundancy of the whole thing. We only discover pieces of the reason why it was commissioned and how it can afford to live on this type of work. The work of art comes to life, but all its talk without conclusions leads to dead ends.
