I remember Casper's comics, but I don't remember any comics. Perhaps they were not memorable; I don't know, but at my advanced age, I'm looking at this very first Casper animated yesterday. Later, I was shocked to read user comments here. Have people lost the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn all over again that Casper is not like other ghosts, who like to go out every night and scare everyone's c-p. "He sees no future in this", according to the narrator here. Instead, one evening he goes out into the rural area of ​​the city, inadvertently scares some animals and can't find friends. He brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him shout and make friends with him. The two have become friends, but soon the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress. <br /> <br /> Other reviews have mentioned everything that happens, so I'll talk about it too. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is in tears for losing "the only friend he has ever had". But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie" the fox becomes a spirit figure like Casper, jumps on his knees, licks his face and comments the narrator "they lived happily ever after". Both characters seem very happy. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about this? This is a nice story with a nice happy ending.
