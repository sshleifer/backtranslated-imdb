Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and been bothered by the violent violence would like to see this movie. Even if it wasn't a hit at the box office or TV show, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a good reason to show it a little at a time. I liked the way they formed Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would do in other films, his appearance is very close to what a Jewish man would look like. What surprised or frightened me was the scene in which Caiaphas spoke to Jesus about Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Although this may not have been a racist comment, Colin Blakely was trying to make it look like Chris Sarandon resembled the eyes of the prominent men of those times. The portrait of Pilate by Keith Michell was enormous, compared with his previous interpretations in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David". But if we compare his portrait of Pilate with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, we can say that he really painted the impression of a Roman procurator well.
