Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann have collaborated to create some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film, however, is the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serves as a backdrop for the story. Some of the best cinemas ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> In all five westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were perfectly expressed. No exceptions here, up to parts that could only have a few lines, the characters are firmly engraved with those lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical lonely bite in this film whose only real friend is his assistant Walter Brennan. It is Brennan's death at the hands of the bad guys who make him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is the bad boss of the piece and he was an undervalued actor with a wide range. He could play delightful old codgers, authoritarian figures and in this case a particularly bad and clever villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns ever.
