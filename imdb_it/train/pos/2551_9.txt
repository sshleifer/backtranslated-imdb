This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce - which shows, and I mean this as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is courted by a wealthy Argentine (Roland), who asks her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived by plane and immediately launches into a reminiscence directed by the public about the last time Caroline decided to be in love with someone else: an amateur sculptor (Gardiner). The film plays the story of Anthony's strategy of separating Caroline from his sculptor, and how this experience helps him with his Argentine. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect cast: Ronald Colman is at his most sophisticated and charming Reginald Gardiner is the most exhilarating, Gilbert Roland is the most exotic and Anna Lee is simply deliciously fanciful. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production seems like a labor of love. There are wonderful touches, such as breaking Colman's frame and addressing the camera, and the exceptional use of a sliding bar door. It is a pity that it was not released on DVD - this is the kind of film that can only awaken interest in the classic film.
