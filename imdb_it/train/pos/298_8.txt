New York has never been so beautiful! And nobody has ever seen anyone in this movie. While the script is a bit light, you can't help but appreciate this movie or some of the characters it contains. You almost want people like this to really exist. The attractiveness of the actors is what he really questioned (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good). Go ahead and rent or buy this movie, you'll be glad you did.
