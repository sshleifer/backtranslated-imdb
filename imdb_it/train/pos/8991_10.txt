TO DIG! it's fun, fun, fun, interesting, elegant and very well done. Knowing that it was made on such a limited budget over 7 years, it is incredible that such a story can be told, especially with such an important style and substance. If you are a music fan or documentary fan, this is a must see. <br /> <br /> Focusing on Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a ingenious megalomaniac singer supported by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I didn't know that this is a video of real people, I would swear that it was an incredibly well-written and imaginative scripted piece. The story is compelling, concise and simply incredible.
