I was about thirteen when this film was released on television. Since then it is far superior to action than most films. Martin Sheen is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also offers excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain is superb. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests the water" in his Ford '34 (COOL) along the mountain highway it is spectacular! <br /> <br /> The ending is grand. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the low rating I received. I imagine that the younger generations have more interest in much of the garbage that is coming out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste eludes the masses!
