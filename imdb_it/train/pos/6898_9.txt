This is an ironic film from the beginning, with a voice-over that mocks everything French and then produces a rather naive but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Interpreted by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the unleashed young man firmly believes in the destiny that preaches the sinuous Lollobrigida - in particular that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo will soon discover that she too is in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Moved by swords battles, rides and other lively action sequences, the film moves at a fast pace and with many comics moments. Direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and takes itself so seriously that I could not reconsider those shortcomings. Look for Noel Roquevert, a traditional and heavy film in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, making it a nuisance, and giving the script to the fortune-teller who reads the hand of La Lollo! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is King Louis XV megalomaniac and lustful! That's not all: so many beautiful women in a film make me want to be in France and on the set in 1952! The film may have come out that year but its verve, its cheek, its superb narration, its immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, let alone to all those who love films in general and caccopallini in particular! Show it!
