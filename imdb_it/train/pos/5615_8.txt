A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski behaves well as the introverted suspicious who tries to adapt to his squalid housing in Paris and his housemates. Chilling at the beginning due to the apparent petty and self-obsessed tenants and terrifying later as he develops his defenses which will ultimately be his downfall. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that he had a certain logic, keeping in mind the plot. However, it could have worked without and would have removed the somewhat theatrical element, but perhaps it was thought because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the appearance of a theater at the end. I can't help thinking that there are more than a few of the director's feelings of not being a true "French" and a Jew. Still, there is a lot to enjoy here including a beautiful performance from a stunning Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.
