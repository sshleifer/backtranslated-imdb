Perfect for families with small children who are looking for carefree films that do not contain violence and that are compelling for the child and fun, even if completely trivial, for adults. It's not a bad movie for a low budget job. Children will be amazed by Santa's workshop and the "magic" that allows him to enter homes through chimneys that seem too small or houses without chimneys! <br /> <br /> Children will be thrilled with Santa's success in foiling the evil devil called Pitch (complete in classic red dress with horns and tail!). They will be in solidarity with the poor girl whose greatest wish is to have a doll to love. And the poor rich little guy who just wants to spend time with his parents forever absent. And which child does not know someone at school that is just like the bad boys who are drafted by Pitch to help catch Santa and ruin Christmas? In the end, everyone, including bad kids, gets just what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will fascinate children both from Santa Claus and from the message of love that he delivers to people all over the world. /> <br />
