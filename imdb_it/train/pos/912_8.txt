This film brings back many memories of old classic cinema, in which the actors didn't have to take off their clothes to let the spectators watch their movie. <br /> <br /> First, I think the main strength of this film is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely the making of the film. <br /> <br /> I have seen many comments about the film that is malariously sweet and too muddy. In response to this, I think that to a certain extent this is a correct analysis, however considering that this is a Barjatya film, I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been significantly resized. HSSH was almost unbearable to see in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, when sentimental moments come, you find yourself smiling, hoping that the twins will give their best and hoping nothing bad will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another important strength is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have played very well, particularly Shahid, who looks good in the film. Amrita simply looks wonderful and should be seriously considered as a future major star. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the film as a whole, I feel it was too long. Part of the central part could have been cut and might have had an even greater impact. I also think about music, even if it adapts to the film when you see that the situations are slightly outdated and the film could have benefited if a more updated soundtrack was available. Although the representation of the songs by Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein is wonderful. <br /> <br /> All in all, I highly recommend this film, it's romantic, it looks great and has a dramatic climax (I won't go into details, in case you haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> PS If you are prone to crying, take a handkerchief (I needed several)
