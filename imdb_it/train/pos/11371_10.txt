This is a truly remarkable piece of filmmaking. From the beginning I was completely in love with the (real) story when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cried while performing autopsies on the remains of children's bodies. This is therefore the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, it sounds so good and with so much sympathy that the viewer begins to pity him, until we remember what it is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, magnificently played by Max Von Sydow was absolutely credible in every detail, and the point he makes when he talks about paranoia in the Soviet Union is all too obvious from the behavior of local Communist Commissioner Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. As for me, the exceptional performance was by Donald Sutherland, demonstrating once again what a superb actor he is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov that the FBI had followed him closely and admired his work. This film overshadows the silence of the innocents, from the evocative and gloomy Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Rate this movie 10/10
