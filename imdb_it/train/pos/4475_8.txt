The United States was still fighting World War II (the film was released between VE day and VJ day). Each study was worth making combat films in which fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans in general sang and danced. The Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on depressing days when everything was rationed. Most of the musicals of the day were simply a group of musical numbers put together with the best available storyline to fill the time until the next musical number! I have the feeling that the people who are reviewing this movie are all born after 1970. Depressing how quickly we forget. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been called "The Search for Jose Iturbi" but now everyone is wondering why. Allow me to explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists to embellish a concert stage. He agreed to make some films in 1942, but Hollywood had been following him for almost a decade at the time. Iturbi has been not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned in advance - and did anyone ever notice that the other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, who produced that film and many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with interesting young Americans in classical music. Grayson is wanting an audition with Iturbi in the film was not unlike real life at that time. Everyone wanted Iturbi then. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he did many concerts at military bases). Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this film was shot, Sinatra was just 30 years old and was under contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbi was now a worldwide sensation for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> And for the lack of a plot, the Americans didn't need the plot. They were tired of war, they were sick of fear for their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the certainty that in the end things went well. They needed music, smiles, joy and romance. This film and others like it delivered just what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lessons. Mouse dancing apart, the best scene of the film occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them "ignorant" who compliments the other's music. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard who conquered more than America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon put together, please visit my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where it is possible to find a summary of the plot, extracted from reviews of "the day" films and images from this and other MGM musicals of the 40s, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
