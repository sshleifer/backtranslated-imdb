After reading several comments, I felt I had to add my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable short films I've ever seen. I had the chance to see him at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this film was incredibly beautiful and exciting. The story was wonderfully complex, especially for such a short period of time. The story centers on a girl victim of a violent father. Soon the possibility is given to "stop" him from a demon played by "Eric Etebari of Witchblade". After seeing the show, I was pleasantly surprised by how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he could behave so well! His character was deeply complex and very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb on his part. The girl was fine and her father was decent. There is also death in this that follows the girl until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and the cinematography were absolutely stunning. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare to see such a high quality short film. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable to any major movie. This does not mean that it is not flawless - I thought it took a while to get going and the introduction was a bit long. But this remained in my head days after watching it. There are few short films with this level of quality.
