This is a truly classic film in its history, acting and film presentation. The wonderful actors are full throughout the film, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart is the main character. In real life he greatly admired and appreciated Jimmy, and in fact gave him his first acting roles, and helped him to be calmer with his appearance on the set. The "chemistry" between the two was always evident, and so warm and pleasant to watch. She was such a beautiful young woman and so sweet in her personality portraits. The story of these two young people and how in the end they will unite in the end is fascinating to look at and pure magic show. Presentations of warming of the heart are also given by the other supporting actors in this wonderful story / film. All the merit of giving Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Classic Cinema, which has a special charm for all generations. everyone must see it !!!
