There are no people like "Show People" Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs Davies was a "clip" of this film; the delightful parody in which he lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was in view of this film at the time; however, it is possible that he saw it in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davies for a meal in the commissioner - throwing his hat in the ring with some wonderful pieces at the dining table. Indeed, Haines and Davies offer great comic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) leading his daughter Davies to Hollywood, of course it will become the new sensation of Tinseltown. In fact, Davies and the already arrived Haines become comedy stars. But, Davies wants to become a real drama queen. Davies leaves Haines and joins the dramatic Paul Ralli. But the public prefers Davies in more comical roles; perhaps director King Vidor is offering a case for life-imitating art? <br /> <br /> Full of great movies set in Hollywood, both on and off the set. Full of great "cameos"; At a dinner in the studio, at the table of the stars, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best bit, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough courage to ask Davies for his autograph! While the cameos are fun, they, and the episodic sequences, help "Show People" to become a less important film and an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
