Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night she was killed she was out with a mysterious woman who refused to give him her name. After being charged with the murder, the police visited all the places he had been with her, but people only remember that he was alone. He is condemned to die and his secretary (Ella Raines) decides to find the killer herself because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This was made as Universal's B movie (watch the cast - all the main characters and one star - Franchot Tone - in decline). The budget was small and the cast was mostly unknown, but what came out is one of the best noir films of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that comes from an excellent book by William Irish (a pseudonym of Cornell Woolrich). It moves quickly and looks simply fantastic. And there's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. coming out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the censorship didn't cut it). <br /> <br /> There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect. Tone gives a terrible performance. It looks horrible and it's just awful. Curtis is also stiff and insipid like Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so emotionless. But Raines is pretty good in the lead role. She is pretty and full of life. Even the last scene in which the murderer pursues her is never true. It is practically not a physical threat and its reactions seem exaggerated. <br /> <br /> However, I'm giving this a 9. A really great movie - defects aside.
