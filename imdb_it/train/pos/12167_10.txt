What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that it stops working? How can you get a man on your own? When the trivial crap we have to do to be part of society becomes too much, what happens? Frownland explores these questions. Definitely a surprising original Bronstein debut. The tone is strange and claustrophobic when we enter the mind of a boy named Keith who is so messed up that he can't form an appropriate sentence. We follow him as he tries to get in touch with people and function day after day. Many of us have known people like this - people who say "sorry" too much or "appreciate it" when there's nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people out there this way, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because his interesting and Bronstein and the lead actor, Dore Mann, do a great job. This film is non-commercial as can be achieved with a film. Some friends shot it within a few years, saving money. It was shot on 16mm and the appearance of the scratched film is beautifully low. Without a distributor, this could be hard to find, I think it was randomly projected in the last year or so. I hope it will be on DVD at some point. I saw him at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that tells you anything about how strange this movie is. Highly recommended.
