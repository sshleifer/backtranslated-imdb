Great movie, I loved it. Excellent editing and use of the soundtrack. Capture the true feeling of Indian life, but we can all relate. A well-chosen cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters so that you really care about all of them and feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great and the direction really works as if everyone were real and natural. You can't do anything but cheer on Jess in this movie! The acting was really good, even the tomboy walk and the body posture of both protagonists are very convincing as someone who played a lot of football.
