I really enjoyed this show ... smart acting, intelligent dialogue, fantastic plot with real people ... please take it back or make it available online ... you really lose it .. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Get rid of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance. Please bring it back Not to be furious ... but please! When it went on the air, I looked online and liked how I could see it with minimal interruptions, in fact, the online ABC makes it easy to enjoy the shows when you miss them in the early evening ... the times of endless recordings are over. Every time you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
