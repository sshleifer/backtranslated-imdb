Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was shot with animation sequences and actors and actresses interacting with animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared into the art of the sidewalk.) I mainly rate this film through the eyes of a child because I haven't seen it for years. So it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that began with the ghostly armor entering the battle) were my favorites. There were also many stop animations used with spells (ie people turning into rabbits), which could be a little dated and stupid now. (Also, I think the film starts slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, this is a funny film and it is easy for children to fit into children's places in the film. It is an imaginative film that is sadly largely forgotten today.
