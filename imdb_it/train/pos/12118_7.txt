When I saw that this movie was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. Condensing the gigantic novel by W. Somerset Maugham to a film that was approaching less than an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. But you know, the film is not badly bad, and it also manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers. <br /> <br /> I have heard many movie fans complain that Leslie Howard was an Was an actor's wet noodle, and he was, but I can't think of anyone better suited to play the role of Philip Carey that to a wet rag, because it is certainly what Carey is. Howard interprets it well, which means you want to shake it and slap it upside down several times, then finally pull it out and buy him a spine. <br /> <br /> Ah, and then there's Bette, like the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who leads her world to collapse around him. I didn't know what Mildred's attraction was in the book and the film remains true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she becomes the most fascinating character in history, and if she is bad and unpredictable, she is at least the most dynamic person on the screen at any given time. Davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of acting, just as Brando would have done almost 20 years later, when he shouted "Stella !!" in that little-known Tennesee Williams game, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is intense to the point of fear. It makes no effort to crush the public, and allows itself to appear ugly and unattractive. His appearance when Carey enters his film late in the afternoon to find her dead or nearly dead of an illness without a name (although not much attention is paid to hiding the fact that it is a sexually transmitted disease) is shocking. Of course, it helps this film to squeak just before the Production Code came into effect; if it had been made a year later, you can bet that things would have been a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really becomes about Carey and Mildred and not much else. I discovered that it is the least interesting and boring part of Maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel the title and seems to be the part that readers are still attracted to, so it seems to me a wise decision on the part of the directors they chose to adapt the novel the way they did it. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
