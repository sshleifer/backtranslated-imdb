Hi again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and believable story of romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and memorable. Excellent colored film. Another film that I liked later was the high society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
