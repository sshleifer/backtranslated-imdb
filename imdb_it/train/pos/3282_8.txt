Not knowing what this movie was about, I checked it at the video store and after seeing it, I liked it. Multi-genre shot by director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by his British accent. The only exception for this film was the end. However, it's worth the rent.
