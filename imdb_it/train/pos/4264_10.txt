I happened to see this movie two or more times and I found it well done! The Second World War had just ended and the so-called "cold war" was about to begin. This film could, therefore, be defined as one of the best "propaganda", the patriotic films that prepare Americans and, secondly, the people still to be formed "Western NATO bloc" of the countries to face the next coming threat. The film celebrates the power of the United States, over the centuries, projecting itself towards the then war, which had just ended. Nice and funny is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Colombo and the beautiful "split" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan by a local drunk Indian. Must see it (at least once, out of curiosity about propaganda fashion over time)! :)
