Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their film ... <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a new irreverent version of a classic story. What classic fairy tale do you ask? Why, "The Lion King", of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there's one thing Disney never runs out of, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that this is not a good movie. They are basically the events of 'The Lion King' as told from the perspective of Timon and Pumbaa. And that's why you'll have to learn the story of 'The Lion King' by heart to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> However, on one level I was watching this and thinking "Oh my god is so lame ..." and on another level I was having a ball. Much of the humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumbaa composes two beds, one big for him and one small for Timon, by the first nanosecond we all know that Timon will take the larger one. But this does not prevent him from being hilarious, which, IMO, is "Hakuna Matata" in a nutshell. It's not what happens, it's like. <br /> <br /> And a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in a movie where Pumbaa is the center of attention? But as the farts go, they are particularly good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The return vocal talent is great. I'm rather surprised that some of the actors were willing to come back, with most of them having only two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> Even the music is fantastic. From 'Digga Tunnah' to the beginning of 'That's all I need', an adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song that was cut by 'The Lion King' and frankly much improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me with nothing to complain about everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are fantastic characters, and although it can be argued that "Hakuna Matata" is simply an excuse to see them in various amusing and assorted compromising situations so be it. It is rare to find characters with whom you want to spend time. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to look creepy? <br /> <br /> In both cases, "The Lion King 1 1/2" is great if you've seen "The Lion King" too many times. Especially if you are thinking now "Don't be silly, there's nothing like seeing" The Lion King "too many times!"
