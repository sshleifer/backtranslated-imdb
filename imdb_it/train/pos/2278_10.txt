Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and seeing this I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elegance and, above all, the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the best interpretation of Nolte to date. Capture the defeat and self-taught Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the tears held behind his eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunting in his detachment from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is underrated and more than effective as "the fairy blue godmother" of Cambell. <br /> <br /> This pinnocesal story of Cambell who tries to be his ideal hero and who is unintentionally becoming his tragic vile ideal is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. And apart from that, it's one of the most deeply romantic films I've ever seen. Cambell is the embodiment of both foolish and wise love. And at the end of the movie's stonily painful end, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy, while his fairy blue godmother grants him his wish. And he realizes that ... well, watch the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that delves deeply into our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
