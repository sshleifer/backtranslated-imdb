The premise of this anime series is about bread, about all the things on which to base a plot! I really laughed. The main character has a special bread-making power with which he was born, and goes to bakery school. I wish it was available on DVD, and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed - it's so beautiful. Even the acronym alone is fun. At one point in the song, there's an Afro-Japanese man with an Afro on horseback, wielding a French baguette like a samurai sword. These images make no sense if you don't see the anime. You'll laugh until your sides hurt. It is certainly the most unique anime I've ever seen so far.
