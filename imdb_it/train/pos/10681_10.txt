While the British produced some hilarious comedies in the 90s - Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc. - the 70s were the true golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s there were entire territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for "sensitivity" that, twenty years later, would become the political correctness. Attempts to grapple with the confusion of this completely modern world have been subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from Monty Python's Flying Circus skits to sitcoms like Man About the House. (Towards the end of the 1970s this "grappling" led to more meditative and bitter sitcoms like the masterpiece Butterflies.) <br /> <br /> Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time - slightly kind, brash, fresh, naive, sometimes outrageous, with some well-made remarks about contemporary life. Compare it to a cynical 90s show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that the two were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man About the House is one of the great Britcoms of the 1970s, right up there with Good Neighbors (The Good Life), and About the House spinning George and Mildred. Its quality is attested by the fact that - as with Good Neighbors - its creators, writers and many of its cast have had continuous successes on British television.
