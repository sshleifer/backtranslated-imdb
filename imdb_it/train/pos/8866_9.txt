"COSBY," in my opinion, is a CBS hit, a must see! I'm not sure I've never seen all the episodes, but I still liked it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really loved the theme song. If you ask me, even though I liked them all, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn hadn't died during the show's run. Ever since it happened, I've always wondered what the show would have been like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can now be seen on TBS, I strongly suggest that you take it if it goes on air forever
