I will do it short and sweet because I don't think there is much you can say to someone about this show that has never seen it besides its hilarious funny and unique, for me it is perhaps the most entertaining show ever. <br /> <br /> You really have to watch it to understand its humor and it took me a few episodes to really get into it, but once inside it doesn't come back. For example, the way the character of Hydes always wants to see his friends get into some sort of trouble the more fun it gets becomes. <br /> <br /> His well-rounded classic I mean the cast, the writers, the director, it's just a recipe for success. An actor that I think always has a hard time is Ashton Kutcher, but I want to say that he is fantastic in this show, I don't think it's possible for Kelso's character to be played by anyone else, it takes someone very clever to play someone stupid. All the main characters are fantastic and it wouldn't be a useful review if I didn't mention the cold stone fox Mila Kunis, now this is a spicy encounter with a ball that has all jokes aside from an incredible show.
