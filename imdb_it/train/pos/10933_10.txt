Be careful with this. Once you get your gloves on, it will change the way you look at kung-fu gestures. You will be a storyline from all the kung-fu movies now, you will miss the depth and development of the character, you will be craving for mystery and unpredictability, request a dynamic photographic work and incredible backdrops. Unfortunately, you won't find all these aspects together in a kung-fu movie, EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms! <br /> <br /> Easily the best kung-fu film of all time, Venom mixes a rich plot, full of twists, with colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best cameramen to get out of the 70's. The success of someone who loves the film depends on the ability of the spectators to decipher which character and who is specialized in what poison. One is the centipede, two is the snake, three is the scorpion, four is the lizard and five is the toad. Each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Here is the hook, we learn together with the student's character, discovering who these different men turn out to be. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we must choose who to trust and who does not, just like him. Let's learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only the plot, the characters and the camera are fantastic, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more precious than almost any film of this genre. It's worth a couple of watches to collect everything that's going on. Poisons are a lesson in what kung-fu can really do ... just don't expect many other kung-fu movies to match your glove.
