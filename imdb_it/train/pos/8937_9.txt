This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and great effects. It tells a true story of the struggles of two African American women in a turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This film challenges us all to look at our personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good message.
