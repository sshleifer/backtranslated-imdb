Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has just started for this (no site yet? Wth?), So I doubt many of you have heard of it. In truth, I didn't even (a species). When I received the post, I thought it was another code name and actually I was worried that it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when it doesn't work, so I enjoy 100% as a mere mortal spectator. Turns out they weren't Transformers and I knew about it when it was "that Neil Gaiman movie". What is it? Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a shooting star. More than that and I would give information about the plot which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) ruin your fun. If you really want to know what it is, go and buy the book. It is said, Gaiman could be a sort of writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so enjoyable if it's a surprise. And for that, it certainly was. This projection was "special" as it included not only film critics, but also exhibitors (rarely have mixed screening) and local science fiction / fantasy people. So you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how sweetly I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale written by a famous author in the world of comics. But he was not the Lord of the Rings. He was not even another aspirant of Lord of the Rings (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than this. <br /> <br /> But, like the Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, the humanism of the film that sells the fantastic qualities. It's certainly a romantic story, but with generous flashes of humor. And that humor is the kind that is not slapstick Shrekism. It's more like comedy than comedy. Before we go any further, let's review this movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is, at least, good. It's always hard to say anything more about fantasy films, but I think there have been superb roles. Unfortunately, Michelle Pfieffer is not one of them. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. But Rupert Everett was a real jerk. I mean, a big bad guy. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin 'O'Toole - which is wonderful. Ricky Gervais is perfectly in the cast and shows why. It seemed that Robert De Niro was having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, however, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) As a protagonist it was a nice surprise from a guy I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I have always been of conflicting opinions with her. She can be big, so it looks like she may miss the mark. In this, she is the first. And she is, literally, the protagonist of this film. Of course, his accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, it's not as good as it can be when Cox isn't in the scene. Anyway ... well, look for yourself. <br /> <br /> The special effects are attenuated but accomplished, and only meaningful where they should be. The best flying ship yet - sorry Potter. The direction is carefree and flows well. Cinematography could have been better but not all films in New Zealand. All the rest is the higher end. <br /> <br /> And now that it's done ... <br /> <br /> ... writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, hell. It is difficult, in today's climate, to do something original and, at the beginning, one begins to wonder. A kingdom, a dying king, a boy out to prove his worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) - what's new? But the story of Gaiman attracts you with its superficial familiarity only to subvert everything in a sweetly original story of a boy and his heart. And, even if you suspect how it will end, you start to be amazed in the third act and, if you are myself, you find yourself involved in a stimulating climatic comparison and hoping for the best. In the end, you will find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be, but too often they are not. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, don't worry, it's done correctly.)> <br /> Those to whom I spoke later they had the same impression I had. A great movie for all ages and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The empty space is inserted only after the film has been released in a large version, because, well, you might expect it. You'll know when you come out anyway. I sincerely hope that Stardust does not get lost in the tents. Even if it were so, it would be my pleasure to push it into the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> You forgot to add the {WITHHELD} to reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Perhaps a somewhat noble evaluation, but I am still confident that the years are forming now, there will be the same "Oh, I love that movie", the answer to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.
