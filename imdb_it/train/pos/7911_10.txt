As a child I loved computer animation, even though it was EXTREMELY limited and the instruments were almost non-existent. This film, while I admired surprising images and almost hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving objects in the computer. This is a complete package, between music and video, which really contains a one-two punch. If you know any children who want to be involved in computer animation, this is a MUST HAVE. <br /> <br /> Still, almost 20 years later, I consider this film one of my favorites among the top 3. Originality, I think, is still unsurpassed by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits. I'm currently trying to see if I can do it myself; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then this film deserves a TON of imitation =)
