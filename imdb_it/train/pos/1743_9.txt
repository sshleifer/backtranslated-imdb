After seeing many Greek films I feel very wary of many of them. But after watching this I felt amazed. The films are fantastic without a big attempt. You can't say that the script is so great or that the photograph is perfect or something technical. It's a true story and it's happening in rural Greek areas in places forgotten by God. The film is like a punch in the stomach and I really wish things weren't like that. It obviously speaks of the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) to something different. The problem with this guy is not that he is an ex-convict. The problem is that he is not one of these people. It's different and they don't want them (that's why all the good things he's doing become boomerangs for him). And he also talks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are opposed to the hunt for the King, but they don't dare say their opinion. In the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and try to act as God says, but at the same time act unjustly towards the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end you can draw a positive lesson from this bad story, in the sense that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even alone, you're lost (and it's not far from reality). I think it's tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everyone. No comment for the main actor because he has already been awarded a prize and I think his show was great. A small comment for Hatzisavvas (he plays the cop), he is like a dinosaur, he has played many roles and I am sure that this role was very easy for him but it sounds so good that he cannot be denied great success. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good Greek film.
