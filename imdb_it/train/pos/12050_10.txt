Most horror movies are actually horrible movies. They can become the same or the same old. The same package is offered every minute with an economic thrill (usually "splatter") and nowadays they can pack every second with flashy special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror film is to suspend the public's sense of disbelief. For example, I saw both recent Mummy films and almost had the vertigo of seeing ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars a second to make those films and my sense of disbelief has never been suspended, it has grown. <br /> <br /> The subtlety can be more terrifying. Less is better. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Woman in Black" on the A & E channel for the first time. After browsing through the usual 987 bad television channels, I stopped to watch it. This film almost has the feeling of a production of "Masterpiece Theater". For me it was fine, I always preferred TV and British movies. <br /> <br /> Most viewers would see that this is too slow. But the slow pace helps give credibility to the story. The special effects are few that lead the viewer to think that this film is set in the real world making us a little more uncomfortable. The trick and costume for the ghost are kept simple and credible. Hollywood would have made her look like a demon from hell with bright eyes - claws of fangs etc. Hollywood would have done too much and turned this idea into mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The woman makes only five appearances in the film. Most of them are where it appears in the distance and this also creates good fear. If she appeared too often, she could reduce the mood she creates. However this film is so well made that through much of the film we are led to perceive that she is there all the time but not visible. The scene in which she "visits" Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her a little too close is a masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> This is just an extraordinary film that I think is one of the best horror films ever made. I have a copy of "The Haunting", "The Changling" and a zillion more. I haven't seen anything better than "The Woman in Black", even though I'm still watching. This film is so well made that it also gives the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment in which I almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke to the people that from time to time I have some fear that it might appear in the middle of the street or that I would see it looking through my window, etc. Perhaps he could be in the crowd at the mall staring at me with a look of hatred. Here's what a truly exceptional horror film should be. Like a novel by LaFanu, the woman in black approaches you very slowly and wraps you around your neck and before you know it, she squeezes your life and then it's too late. <br /> <br /> The closest thing I have to criticize is that this was done for the small screen ... and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print. I just paid over $ 40 for my second copy of this movie. It's an important award in my collection. Now I'm looking for an even better horror film that not only gives chills but also qualifies a dramatic sound.
