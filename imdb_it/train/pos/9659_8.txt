'Presque Rien' is a wonderfully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Avoiding both stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderfully naturalistic film, superbly interpreted, inspired by the seaside town where the action takes place, never melodramatic but often painfully real. If anything it is almost too realistic, because there is little in terms of conventional plot, just scenes of a lifetime. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts less than it could in such a subtly designed world. 'Presque Rien' may not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism works well when compared to the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted points of view that often address this issue.
