I traced the journey two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the movie !! What a ride! And what a journey to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! Listen to Dario laughing at being in the water in Panama City, seeing his trepidation of being too close to the alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he traveled by balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet of eating a spoon of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - the boys will be boys. This film must be seen by everyone, young and old. Dario and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the crew members are witnesses of the heart of the new generations. They gave Darius a new wheelchair; have documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on his life's journey; and have touched many, many lives. By increasing DMD awareness and encouraging research funding, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West, a cure for DMD.
