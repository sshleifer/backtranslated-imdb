First of all, I would like to stress that the people who criticized this film have made some obvious mistakes. Whatever has a rating lower than 6/10 is clearly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing cinematic effects. The actors are highly credible, the narrative thought that it causes and the horror and graphic content extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystique in this film. Many questions arise as the public is revealed to the strange and strange creature that creates the habitat in the dark tunnels of the rat. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A fantastic film with a great cooling factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that must be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Let's wait for more of these fantastic films !!
