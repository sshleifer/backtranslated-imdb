A good movie with - for the moment - an intense, sprawling, rather obscure story that is somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers", though not so brutal. The story starts quickly and doesn't stop, with several really good dialogue scenes between Jeff Webster, Stewart, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is somewhat reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a work by Mann-Stewart, but I found it much less sentimental and more interesting. There are some warnings: a too wrapped (and rather sentimental) ending; Corrine Calvert, 24, is not very convincing as a naive French teenager, and of course the film takes place in Mythic West, a land of fairy tales in which the true laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark and disengaged man who thinks he doesn't care about anyone but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beaten. A beautiful drama in western costume.
