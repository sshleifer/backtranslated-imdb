Despite the excellent Vanilla Sky trailers, I expected to be disappointed with the film because I had heard that it didn't get good reviews. However, I left the cinema completely amazed at how beautiful Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There has been no bad acting throughout the film, every single character is believable. The romantic moments between the character of Cruise, David Aames and the character of Cruz, Sophia are realistic and intimate tears (probably because they were a future couple). <br /> <br /> The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there are very few chances to guess the ending. However, the ends are tied towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings composed of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention everywhere. This is not difficult because it is likely that you will be completely attracted to the film and will not take your eyes off the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> Usually leave cinema forgetting everything about the movie, I watch. But Vanilla Sky is still in my mind days after seeing it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple and superficial films.
