When two screenwriters make a script for a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany, you know something will be fine. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes in which Patrick looked at Holly up and down like a sort of objectifier, those were just weird. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big part. The weird rubbery worm was just weird. Nathan was a very nice cat. But what was that scene in which Patrick followed Holly into a cesspool and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he doing fumbling in there? And not all males have a female, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew out of Victor, it was weird.
