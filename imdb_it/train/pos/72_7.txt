I recently saw this 1954 film with Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price plays Don Gallico, a magician / inventor who is driven to kill when his boss steals many of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a short role by the adorable Eva Gabor). Even though Price is a murderer, I actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who has gone mad from the greedy people around him and who continue to take advantage of him. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not do it I have the "horror" factor of some of its most famous roles (like my favorite, "House of Wax"), but it still has enough to make the viewers' interest is maintained. <br /> <br /> This is a must for Vincent Price fans.
