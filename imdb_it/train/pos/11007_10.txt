The characterization of Michael Sullivan, the clumsy and irritating Morgan Sullivan, and the fact of watching him release fragments of his true identity under the influence of single malt scotch and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliant and a joy to watch . His offer of a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, made without thinking or even asking and is lost in his face, neck and lips. No matter brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. Even love cannot be "plagiarized" with any of its two false women. In gradual stages, he begins to do without glasses, to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times. The extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes this almost a "noir" science fiction film in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would have liked to see more vulnerabilities in the representation of Lucy Liu, whenever she sees him in his various frustrated states, the man he loves and for whom he is carrying out a mission based on blind faith, some detained vulnerabilities and flashes of sincere compassion and concern would have made a performance less one-dimensional on his part. It has no correspondence with Northam's talents, but all in all I really enjoyed this film and would like to learn about other scripts written by the same author.
