"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps my all-time favorite. The best and most fun of Kajawari Yoshiaki, known for splatter souls and squalid hentai-ecchi souls. I wish he did more campy like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic sequence of CG, the parts in which Lord Helumis makes his henchmen explode, the party revolts that Bill cause (one of the funniest scenes) and every time he appears my favorite character, Worsle appears. <br /> <br /> Watch this. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: This is not for fans of sophisticated and serious souls!
