Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he manages to make love with a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The big stick, often used in the search for justice, is retired forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual cheeky as he persecuted those who stole from the treasure to lend to usurer amounts to whom I could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual extraordinary talent of sword and skill of the great boy was present, along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I will miss it.
