I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese films like these are never shown in prime time. I must say that this is one of the best serious films of all time, which outlines the difference between the people of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but it can only improve as HK is learning Mandarin. He also showed me how the indie rock scene exists in mainland China and how the Chinese know how to strum the guitar and get the funking house! Who said China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his clean and sparkling voice, honest acting and a total magnet. I recommend this film to those who don't know much about Asian people to purify themselves of typical Western stereotypes and people who love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Check it out!
