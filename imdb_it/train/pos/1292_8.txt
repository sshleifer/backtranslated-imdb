Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and siblings mainly due to money problems. It's crazy to have your own house and your own rules, since his brothers always steal his money saved and his parents neglect his wishes. A terrible day, Preston was riding a bicycle; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, was trying to escape from the police and accidentally ran the car on Preston's bike. Needing to stay away from the police, Quigley quickly gives a check to cover Preston's bicycle damage. The problem was: it was a blank check! Preston is a smart guy and he decides to get a high price for that check: 1 million dollars! All that money gives Preston things he always wanted, like a villa with a pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! The problems begin to begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston in a difficult situation and facing many problems. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
