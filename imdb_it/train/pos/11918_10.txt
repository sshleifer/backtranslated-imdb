"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from Ted Turner's library; Disney did it again in 1994, this time, using the California Angels (now the Angels of Los Angeles) as the team (Disney owned this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, also, good use of words, eh ???? ). <br /> <br /> This film was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family, only if the Angels won the pennant. So one night he called God for this. The praying boy could see the help coming on the road (and ONLY that boy); for example, when the first angel came down, a player hit a ball so hard not only the bat broke, so did the ball !!!!! For much of the 1994 post-All Star season, the Angels were at the top of the AL West (of which my Rangers home team is one and still is). However, they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (there wasn't a central Baseball division back then, so Chicago was in the West), and no angel was there to help. So, a new rule was created: no angel can help in championship games. But wait! In the final match of the championship, the Angels won !!!!! It was really a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: this is a good movie. I mean, I've been praying every night for the last few years to ask for help with school and stuff like that; Look at me now! My job was good !!!!! So, for one, this shows that if you believe, God can send his angels down to help you with whatever problems you may have in life. And secondly, this is a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. This is also an old Disney movie; I only saw him recently on the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels in the Outfield" will change your life forever once you've seen it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
