I've seen this movie numerous times and for the life of me, I can't understand why some people compare it to BABE. This film is not about the secret life of ALL the animals that can secretly talk. Instead, it is a parrot that learns to speak to help its master, a girl with a serious stutter, to overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heartbreaking scene at the beginning. So the great journey begins. Paulie the Parrot sets out to try to find his only great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous bad people. He falls in love with a parrot girl and loses it. He is deceived into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit it. <br /> <br /> Tell his story to a friendly Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines like the kind janitor who has an open mind and a big heart and decides to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot and one of the scruffy characters he meets. <br /> <br /> There is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most children and even more so if parents participate in the fun and watch too. It is a lively, intelligent, epic story of animal adventure and, ultimately, a great love story about a bird and its baby. Marie's research ends with a fairly unexpected surprise for most people who don't know much about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen the wild tribes of Green Parrot in Los Angeles and Pasadena will in particular benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. All children around the world will see that animals form deep attachments and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be cherished. <br /> <br /> so no BABE here, more than an incredible journey with a twist. <br /> <br /> Have fun and try not to tear yourself during the sad parts.
