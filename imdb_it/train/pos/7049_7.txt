In this satire of commercialization and the "carelessness" of war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, a murderer sent to "Turaqistan" to kill Omar Sharif, who is doing oil business that will create problems for the former vice president of the same company US. In addition to this, Hauser must juggle his false position as a producer of fairs, a marriage for pop princess Yonica (Hillary Duff) and a nosy liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The acting (at least for the main characters) was good, as could be expected. Some of John Cusack's dialogues were obviously not written for him, as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it. . . perhaps unrealistic is more accurate. Joan produced a grandiose and often hilarious performance. Marisa Tomei, despite never having been a big fan of her, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was rather terrible. They needed an attractive Middle Eastern (or Russian, or whatever that accent should have been) popstar. Unfortunately, they went 0 to 3 with her. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and did not match the points, especially the dialogue of John Cusack. Not much, mind, but some. Even the story was a bit ridiculous in the points, which is fine for a satire up to a certain point, but here it has taken a new level. Fortunately, the Cusacks and Tomei maintain a relatively calm and calm demeanor, and this is a nice mix between the madness of the film and the leveling of the actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real claims to his name, did a good job with a fairly broad spectrum movie. He managed the small budget ($ 10 million) very well, stretching it to make it look like it was much more. Seftel also managed to blend the humor of history harmoniously. . . with the painful and difficult to control parts of the real war (including massacres of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As for the general satire, his exaggerated gaze on the marketing of the war is very well done, especially the announcements of "Golden Palace Poker" on US tanks. In points, it becomes a bit too much, but in the end it is still accurate portrays what stands for a young style of "Mel Brooks". <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very well done for the meager budget and is certainly worthy of a look. It will not go down as one of the great satires of cinema, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
