This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel I know. The representation of the court of Chancery as "character" in the drama is magnificent. The acting is wonderful, from the sinister Tulkinghorn, to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But it is the spider's stationery network that holds it all together, and the cinematography is superb. What error has the BBC made about copyright, which means that this version cannot be seen in the UK on video or DVD for many years? I tried to find out, but I faced a stone wall. I finally received a DVD copy from Canada.
