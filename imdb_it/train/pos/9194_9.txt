I met this show for the first time when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I was looking for subtitles to help me with my Japanese. The host mother warned me to stay away because she thought it was strange, but I found it delicious! Koyuki showed such mixed character traits and the spirit of Matsujun made my day every time I tuned in! I saw it for the first time on "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked it a lot more in this! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to find that they didn't change much during the show. Their relationship grew, but they didn't really. Still, everyone had a fun time (even for Fukushima!).
