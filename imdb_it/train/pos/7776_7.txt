Does anyone know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack may have been a Masseratti. The character of Hudson told his father that he was taking a job in Iraq, isn't he so punctual? I had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank for most of my life, maybe this was the film that impressed me. Loren Bacall surely had some ribs in this film and probably played Malone but the Malones part made an impact the Oscar for the best supporting role is most sensational. Was Loren's part considered a leading role? The character of Hadley was probably a fairly common photo of the magnates of his era as he was a normal boy who made him great in an emerging industry but in the construction of a whole city he had forgotten his children to be carried by his wife. At that moment, being a widow, he realized that he was all he really had and was ruined, seeking attention, so rather than trying to relate to his children he blew his head down. An ancient story about morality. But seriously, what were those sports cars?
