I would just like to say that I saw this movie twice and I love it! The acting is great and even if it's a plot like "Raise your voice", I think the plot is never boring for people who like this kind of thing. There are great lessons and it shows us that we can do anything if we try. An incredible film. I'm sure this is one that I'll be watching for a long time to come. Although Britney Spears writes the book, it is a fairly realistic plot, perhaps not of the part she falls in love with, but the part of being different and in trouble, but going out at the end is very true for real life. The only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would have met the perfect boy of her dreams if she was ugly or average? I doubt it..
