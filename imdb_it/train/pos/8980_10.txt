I must admit that I am a big fan of The Dandy Warhols in the first place, which is why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern documentary rock, is that it is not just about a page in the history of a band (like "I Am Trying To Break Your Heart", on Wilco) , but rather covers a long period of the band's history. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed friends / rivals The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and made tremendous 1500 hours of video raw, cut that 1:45 hours (the future version of the DVD will contain much more material than the original film). The result is amazing: there are no fillers: the film is pure and genuine archive of films, which gives you the feeling of how the cinema progresses that you live with the bands, in all these years. <br /> <br /> Both bands at the beginning of their career promised to "make a revolution" in making music, and not to sell their souls to the devil of the "recording industry". However, their paths quickly dissolved: Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular (especially in Europe) after just one album, while The Brian Jonestown Massacre (with its self-destructing leader Anton Newcombe) has dissolved into oblivion (at least as depicted in the film). And the film follows the descent of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, in contrast to the rise of The Dandy Warhol. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was very pleased with the film and its approach to telling the story of Anton Newcombe (for example, Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - tells), but after a while I have realized that there is something wrong with this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, treat Anton Newcombe as a missing person. The project began in 1995 as a documentary on several promising emerging groups, in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (this is why all these years Ondi Timoner had unmediated access to both bands). It was Anton Newcombe who brought The Dandy Warhols to the project. In the end he was completely ignored, as if he had been kicked out of the project. Everyone talks about BJM, but does not participate in the discussion. I guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process. There are always both sides of the story, and here we only have one ... Obviously, as you'd expect, Anton doesn't endorse the final result and sees this film as a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is very much influenced by Dandy Warhol. Of course, the winner takes all, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (leader of DW) narrates (even if it seems a good choice - provides a feeling of apparently closer involvement) and that the belated band history is represented not in a proportional way ( BJM is covered until 1997, and DW - until 2003), does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is (a little) superficial. What do you want to teach us? As one critic said: "... the film examines the old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? Can it prosper and get due, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?" No, DO NOT EXAMINE these questions! It simply describes the story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician, narrated by a less brilliant but successful man who indulges in self-confidence and the eternal coldness of an ego greater than the mountain. <br /> <br /> However, the film was fun - it's raw, it's cool, it's elegant, it's just ... damn interesting, at least for DW or BJM fans. For the rest of the crowd - I don't know ...
