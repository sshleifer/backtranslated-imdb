"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful training story about a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, who escapes her suffocating roots to become herself. Although the title character is artistically played by the beautiful Ashley Judd - probably her first role in the film, although to be quite proud of - the emphasis is not on becoming "someone", the next Madonna (be it the mother of Jesus) or the fearful and attracted singer of attention). <br /> <br /> Emphasize instead the instinct of the following and to be a bit introspective about them, to grow in their own ideal and adult self. NOTE: This is not an action movie !!! He uses an occasional narrative voice (from Mrs. Judd) as she writes in her diary - and, oh, I see I have just lost the male half of the readers out there. But be patient with this beautiful film, in which we learn that bliss can be discovered - oh, I don't know, bringing water and cutting wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / screenwriter Todd Field, who played Nick Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut", plays the noble love interest of Ruby Lee, one who helps her heal her idea of ​​relationships implanted by youth. <br /> <br /> But not even his character is the answer for Ruby Lee: There is no external hero imposed on her. The final message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writer / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee's Gold", did an incredible job showing a young woman growing in herself - facing old challenges of good v. Bad along the way. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is also stellar, and the music used, in particular the cuts of singer Sam Phillips (which I heard is T. Bone Burnett's wife), is right above, above all "Seeking to cling to the Earth. "Now, when I listen to the first chords of that song, tears come to my eyes, pavlovian and unbidden - I'm not sure if it's the music, or the indelible connection to the silent and fascinating message of film empowerment . <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended for all young people trying to find its way. For any woman of any age, it's a must see! The downside: it is NOT on DVD, except in Spanish. (We have learned, however, that it is legal to make a copy of a VHS version, which can easily be found online. My beloved husband found someone with a VHS copy and made a DVD copy made for me.) Although this treasure of a film appears occasionally on the air ?? on an indie channel, usually ?? you can't count on this when you might need it most as a tonic to ease the pressures of the world. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This film should have a great reissue, and it would be, if you were Queen of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
