I think this movie was pretty good. It is strange that now the Olsen twins are 13 years old and have boyfriends and all the rest. I loved it when they were kids on Full House. However, the cast was good and the movie was pretty funny. I got confused about all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of a previous version of It Takes Two.
