Set in the era of the Prague World Depression, this is the story of an ambitious shop assistant who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom he exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mysterious woman is nothing more than the shop assistant of her shop , who seems to be quarreling constantly with his colleague. Add an extra touch (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart- has a relationship with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with the admission that the saleswoman 'liked' Stewart forever, the happy the ending is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although VERY dated (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider - they are too used, together with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, such as a musical cigar box, is out of reach for the entertainment of the common people), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than the 90s which resume "You got Got Mail". In the remake with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of the chain of events are so incredible that the viewer's intelligence is seriously offended. <br /> <br /> "Shop Around The Corner" is innocent walking the path of memory in a time and place that is less complicated, less frenetic and more romantic, known as the Utopia of novelists. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will appreciate this image!
