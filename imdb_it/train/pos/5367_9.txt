This film is one of the most underrated films of its time. When you watch this movie, you are full of action, and when something is not really approaching, humor is not compatible. Brilliant writing for a film that was created to give us a bloody mix, a game show in which the criminals are the competitors, and a near future in which everyone has a blood thirst. Even Arnold does not disappoint us with his best performers. I don't want to ruin anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his "I'll be back line". He gets the best answer of all of them in this movie. I hope you like this gem like I did.
