For those of us Baby Boomers arrived too late on the scene to appreciate James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is quite simple: cool hood meets the sheriff of a small town and All-Hell follows, but the nuts and screws of this movie enchant the Machine nut in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, it is not Casablanca, nor is it a great literature, but it is a serious film about cars, rebellion and the genius of Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is, and for what it will become Martin. I loved this movie that grew up as a teenager in the 70s, and you will too.
