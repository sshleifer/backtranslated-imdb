The closest I've ever seen was a clip shown in an exhibition by Gerard Philippe in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in the remake and having just reached the original a little over half a century after doing it, I can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional, aimed at a now obsolete target. Hollywood had made realistic sword fights since the 1930s, when the greatest of all, Basil Rathbone, crossed sheets with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and therefore leaves only satire. After a while one does not notice and takes delight in the dialogue of Henri Jeanson who remembers the Prisoner Of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to bring out a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a little better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. The print I saw was particularly bad and at one point it completely broke down, so maybe a DVD version would have improved it.
