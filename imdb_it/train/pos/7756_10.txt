I'm not sure it's a kind of masterpiece or a simple flicker of high performance and images. In any case, I'm sure I loved it. From the wonderfully twisted, lurid and intertwined stories, to the delightful and sinister performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the vivid and eye-catching color with which it is all captured, this is high class junk and is very funny. Not to mention the sexually amusing and subtly veiled subtitles that permeate the entire film, always threatening to escape from the image to dialogue, but never doing it. I'd be lying if I said that the sheer value of the film's entertainment didn't contribute to my love for it, but there's a sort of bizarre art behind involuntary comedy (or was it?) And I really, really dug it. I could really get into this melodrama stuff.
