I can't say much more about the plot of the film that hasn't already been said. I haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and its memory never left me. I've looked everywhere. I did research online for this in the past, but I came empty. Last night I was thinking about the movie again and I was trying to remember who was there, but I was only 10 or 12 when I last saw it and I wasn't even sure I had the right name for the movie, so I decided to do another search and finally found this view. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, you could please leave me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com. I would really appreciate it. And anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance is worth it.
