Wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 years to grandmothers. Beautiful vintage piece set in 1962. The story includes Garr, his two sons and Zena (MacClaine) in difficulty trying to make ends meet without a man as the head of the family. The "family" heads west to take the legacy of a long-forgotten relative who left Garr short of slums along the way in the late 1940s. The tenacious Garr, like the sweet but determined mother, brings the whole family into the restoration and opening of the coffee. But wait ...... Zia is an old circus artist with card tricks, magic powders and a sense of jesters' humor ...... she loves bringing children and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games .. ... What happens next is a delightful combination of "Miracle at Lords", launched along with the Cuban missile crises (with genuine TV news from the real event) and a "phantom" joke that becomes totally out of control. This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiousness and gives an unnerving look to the frightening fear of the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. In the end we remain with the wonder of faith, family and rediscovered love. Oh, and the music of the early 1960s is simply fantastic! <br /> <br /> STRONGLY recommend as FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out 10
