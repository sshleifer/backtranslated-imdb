"House of Games" is an impeccably constructed film and one of the few films I saw made me open the screen in amazement at how it ended intelligently and unexpectedly. I saw it for the first time in video some years after reading the review by Roger Ebert, who proclaimed it the best film of 1987. I had my doubts, especially because it's not as well known as other films of that year . Boy, I was a surprise. This was one of the smartest and most well written movies I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is rather a work, not just in terms of plot (which turns and pulls you out of the way only when you think you have understood everything), but also in terms of character development . In my second vision, I began to realize that Mamet's script was successful not only as a clever suspense movie, but that any development of the plot contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the film is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It naturally derives from what we know about the characters, and is therefore much more than a simple arbitrary conclusion. Also the interpretations of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna contribute enormously to the film. I can't imagine any other actor besides Mantegna who plays the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his role with the right amount of moderation to suggest a repressed criminal mentality. Their work, in addition to Mamet's extraordinary script, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It really is worth seeing.
