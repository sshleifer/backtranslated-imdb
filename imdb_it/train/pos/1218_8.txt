This cartoon was strange, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion than other cartoon films. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and a sister who are just a miserable like her. It reaches the lowest point and when the opportunity presents itself, it literally makes a pact with a demon similar to the devil. I found this film very faithful to life and just when things could not get any worse, the girl sees what she did, feels remorse and then changes and then helps this dark and mystical creature learn the human quality of love. Even twins improve, helping bears and then they also have a sense of self-worth. A very positive message for children, even if some elements of the film were strange, it was and still is a rather funny film. The music of Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the film even better
