An incredible little English film for many reasons. First and foremost is a rare Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performance is not up to the standard that he will define as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly credible as the enchanted lawyer. Historically this film is of great interest due to where and when it was shot. Being English he didn't have the big budget of Hollywood movies of the same era and often shows it, but more interesting is the fact that this film was shot just before the war and shows an England that would soon go away. When we look at it today we think in terms of modern morality and look at the fact that this film and its closest American counterpart "It Happened One Night" were in their most daring times of "Fatal Instinct" in our time. But after seeing and enjoying this movie the first time I can't help but feel sad when I look at it today. With half the footage before 1950, saving the remaining films means difficult choices, and unfortunately films like this are often passed to save films that we all think are important. The color change, the lack of contrast and the poor quality of the print most often seen are heartbreaking. This film together with "It Happened One Night" are perfect to curl up with a love under a blanket in the cool of a cool evening and watch, or better yet why not a double function.
