In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil) Orson Welles gave him the role of an exuberant man. In "The Lady from Shanghai" is the only time I see him holding the role of the victim. The role of the culprit, he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I think it's because he was in love with her. Therefore, it is an interesting film. But I also find the story excellent. The direction is brilliant, as usual with Welles: two scenes are particularly brilliant: the one in the aquarium and the final one with mirrors. This film is brilliant. (10/10)
