Although this film is somewhat sterilized (because it was made in an age when people didn't talk about sex), it is an extremely useful short film to show prepubertal girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was paid by the Kotex company, although what might surprise many is that Disney made this film, given that they did many educational films in the 40s and 60s. However, although the film is well done, I think the director has missed a real opportunity. Instead of the beautiful voice of the female narrator and relatively bland images it would have been BIG if they had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know this would have given old Walt an old attack, but wow it would have been a great movie! By the way, although the notion of sex is barely mentioned in the film, it adequately explains menstruation in general. However, some details (especially on sexual intercourse) that I assume were included in the accompanying booklet are missing. <br /> <br /> Now, if I can only understand why I saw a menstruation cartoon.
