This film and the sequel to Barry McKenzie are his, are the two greatest comedies ever produced. A beautiful story that a young Australian travels to England to claim his legacy and meets with his companions, who are just as adorable and innocent as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a block full of big, sayings, where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that it's dry as a dead dingo donger? great characters, top acting, and has great sheilas and more Foster consumption than all the other three films put together. First class. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you've ever heard, and it's full of great celebrities. Surely my two favorite movies of all time, I watch them at least once every two weeks.
