This was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and would have made more. Crawford plays a rich young girl, whose father is wiped out in the bag crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and his brother, William Bakewell, finds a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but he gets it in his head quite quickly. Crawford becomes a newspaper reporter but wants to work on great stories, but he is given some useless material to work with. Theirs is a massacre in which several of Gable's men have been killed and Crawford has witnessed everything. It's a good movie but not one of the best.
