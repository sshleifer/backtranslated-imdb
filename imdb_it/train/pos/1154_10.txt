I think this is perhaps the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just check the "quotes" section; if you think about it, just rent the DVD, since it is the delivery that really makes the lines sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field offers a comical and top performance like you've never seen it anywhere else and Kevin Kline is cool. Robert Downey, Jr. is generally brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a revolt like the besieged client. I've never been a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's fantastic here as a * real * person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun Also Sets" - that the roar you hear below is Hemingway rolling into his grave. Or that, or is laughing very hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Fun, funny, fun.
