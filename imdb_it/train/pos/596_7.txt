This fact for the TV version of the legendary odd odd stand is more objective, more realistic than previous versions of the events, although the only film made after this may have gone too far to humanize the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> The focus here is on Jim Bowie, played with a sharp, cynical detachment of James Arness who is apparently still alive at the age of 85. Then, 65 years old, he returned to acting after years away from the screen to do this part. <br /> <br /> The Puerto Rican Raul Julia humanizes Gen. Santa Ana as no one since J. Carol Naish in 1954 had done. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as a lustful and boastful populace - the gaudier uniforms were never seen before or after. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he has hired but, convinced of his own infallibility, does not listen to him. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays: Col William Travis. His interpretation is serious. It is almost intimidated by the older men who share command with him. <br /> <br /> The only discordant note was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a coonskin cap and wearing Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he had wandered from another movie. Without any belief in representation, the character is reduced to a few scene conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in previous film versions. We find out that Jim Bowie was, in the person of Santa Ana, fighting with his own brother-in-law. The Mexican soldiers behaved in part because they were armed with rifles left by the Napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes a business." Bowie ironically explains. The whole project of defending the former Spanish mission as a fort was militarily discouraged - a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "The Alamo".
