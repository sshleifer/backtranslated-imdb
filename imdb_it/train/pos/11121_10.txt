As a boy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after seeing him go from laughter to paranoia instantly for all seasons and after every little gesture of his way of making you believe he's a gangster, you thought to yourself: OK he's a good actor and can get into the skin of a gangster. But after seeing him open his eyes and fight for his life, I mean that I could almost feel the pain that "made us" believe he was going through. I was so touched by his interpretation that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But nowadays they're old or dead (Brando) and it's OK that they make fewer films and their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. I look forward to seeing Gandolfini in other films in which he offers a completely different role. Can you recommend some of his older films in which he gives a memorable performance?
