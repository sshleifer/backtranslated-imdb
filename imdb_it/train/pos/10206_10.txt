In my years of participating in film festivals, I have seen many small films like this that never have a theatrical distribution, and end up in WalMart's $ 3 containers. I just found the Yank Tanks DVD, very good doc, but how sad to have ended up as a remainder. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I wish I had seen it in the cinema in everything I would have preferred that New Yorker Films had directly translated the title. It's good for Americans to get a little longer. If the film's title helps the American public to explore random chaos, so much the better. Cinema imitates life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Also, I noticed that the subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to understand, making the public gringo reckon. Seeing a movie, especially a shot in Paris, the viewer shouldn't have the effect ruined by being remembered: I am an American who watches a movie and they are translating euros into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer and director.
