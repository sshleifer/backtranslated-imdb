This is one of the best military films ever made. And it's great for his attention to values. It is a great story of human interest that turns into a commitment to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are excellent in the main roles. It is wonderful to see the racism of the master evolve towards respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, guidance and sense of honor. The title indicates the source of their link. I never noticed it until this last time looking at Carl Lumbly's portrait of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, as brilliant. In a sense, it is a cornerstone of the film as it is the memory of Carl of his father that helps overcome difficult times. <br /> <br /> I am selective about the films I purchase. This is one of those rare that I want on my shelf. It will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
