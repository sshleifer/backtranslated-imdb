I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful film, and I created a sense of the era that looks like a journey through time. The characters are really young, Mary is a perfect couple for Byron, Claire is young and a little annoying, Polidori is a convinced persecutor ... they are all beautiful, curious and decadent ... not the scary gothic wrecks . <br /> <br /> Gothic works like an independent film of shock, and I loved it for several reasons, but it works like a Merchant and Ivory film, and from my reading it was the best capture of what summer must have been like. Romantic, yes, but it completely rekindles my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron whenever I think of the film. One of my all-time favorites.
