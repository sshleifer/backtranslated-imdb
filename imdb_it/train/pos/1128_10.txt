Although the recent rereading of part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once fun, "Iphigenia" with the incandescent Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Explaining oneself in a natural environment with Greek actors who speak their language confers such authenticity. A chance encounter with this film on one of the many DirecTV movie channels made me interested despite my concentration problems. There is no glitter or "bling" in this film, just a fabulously rich history impeccably told by actors so real that they feel like a real family in turmoil. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this story. <br /> <br /> JLH
