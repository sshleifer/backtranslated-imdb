I had never seen a silent film until July 24, 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found The Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source as you read this. I started watching Tess of the Storm Country on TCM just to see who was Mary Pickford, who was credited by many for the Hollywood launch. I had no idea what I expected. Two hours later, I came out of it and realized I saw one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, playing a role that was perfectly suited to her. Imagine a fan of cinema in 1922, having never seen anyone so beautiful and so expressive. You should see it again and again. The setting was perfect for such an expressive girl. He was a poor squatter, he couldn't speak the king's English, but you had to admire it. What a movie ... it's time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
