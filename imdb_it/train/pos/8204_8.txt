The sudden impact was overall better than The Enforcer, in my opinion. It was becoming a great movie, but then I saw the villain and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The impact of Sudden was different compared to the previous installments. The plot went in a different direction in this film, as Dirty Harry did not take a police approach this time. We also don't see the villain (s) until later, which means less time for them, which is better for us all. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as Dirty Harry, said enough. Pat Hingle was funny as Chief Jannings, Harry's new assigned boss. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here, either way, it was no different. Michael Currie is as decent as Lieutenant Donnelly, Harry's annoying superior. Personally, I liked Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a revenge against Harry. Albert Popwell was as excellent as Horace, Harry's friend. Audrie J. Neenan was as good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian around the city. Jack Thibeau was chosen well as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's longtime lover, was horribly miscible as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just as horrible as Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would have been much better had it not been written and performed in parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
