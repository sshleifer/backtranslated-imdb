An interesting way of looking at how we humans behave so often is sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that sometimes we destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the problem of how we tend to ignore those who are not so blunt and, in doing so, could miss a great opportunity. Comedy injection also makes watching a movie a pleasant experience. To see for anyone interested in a reflective but comic look at life. I look forward to your next product. I hope you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Great job ...... Joanne
