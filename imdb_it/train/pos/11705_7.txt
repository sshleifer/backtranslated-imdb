Obviously, there was not a huge budget for this film that certainly hindered production. But the story and the ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. I mean brutal at the level of Ju Dou and other (big) Chinese films. I saw it for the first time when I was 14, I ran home and prayed to God to forgive me for everything ...
