This collection of eleven short stories in a film is a great idea and has some great segments, but also some disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to approach their American tragedy. The result of most of them is not just an individual sympathy for the American people, but mainly for intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (UK) presents the best segment, on September 11th 1973 in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the United States. <br /> <br /> The other excellent segments are those of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by US governments in various countries throughout contemporary history; and that of Mira Nair (India), which shows a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States when he was really a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children preparing a harmless shelter against bombs, while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world ; the romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the effects of their war in a small town and the lonely protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; and the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no Holy War but sadness and dishonor. <br /> <br /> The segment of Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very naive, but shows the terrible conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> The segment of Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, horrible, without inspiration and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("11 September")
