The previous reviewer said it exactly. I saw it once, it was enchanted, I saw it a second time when it was retransmitted within one or two weeks of the first airing. I still remember some scenes. The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war the title refers to is the First World War. One of the scenes was set in a section reserved for women in a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my most beautiful moments of all time. I don't think this is a "gay movie", it's an interesting and tender love story, in which the two main ones are women. I'd like to see this movie again; I'd buy it if it ever came out on DVD.
