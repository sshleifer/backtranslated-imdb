Only once in a while do we receive an R-rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. It is an even rarer case when critics will like it. I have just returned from The 40 Year-Old Virgin and I can honestly say that it was one of the greatest laughs of my life. I went to show 10:35 and every line was filled. Not only that, everyone laughed their ass all the time. They are two hours of non-stop laughter. I challenge you to see this movie and not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty and a virgin. And yet, behind this simple five-second line, we are given a deep and complex story that is not only one of the most entertaining you've ever seen, but has some genuine lessons behind it. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, The 40 Year-Old Virgin. We met Steve Carell, as, in my opinion, one of the best stage thieves of all time. Stealing hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially from Anchorman, Steve Carell has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, his time is given to shine as a protagonist. No one will forget his name after witnessing this hilarious hilariously shamelessly exaggerated comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is that it is not 100% stupid. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell really has a purpose and is not just a story to tell. Behind the roughness and the vulgar non-stop run of the film comes an important lesson to learn. Although it is not presented in the best possible way, the film gives us something more than a purely enjoyable time. His ruthless attitude will make you laugh all the time, while at the same time we see the real life struggles of people like Andy and his fellow workers. The end could not have been better. Not only does it provide what was promised, but it offers one of the most memorable numbers a comedy has ever seen. It would have been perfect if Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were in there somehow, but you can't win them all, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think that as Roger Ebert said, Catherine Keener gives an inexplicable perfect performance like Trish, the only woman that Andy really has the heart for. Not only does it give us laughter, but it is absurd to see how brilliantly it feeds the story. She was hired to play the role and she and Carell have an extraordinary, not to say hilarious, on-screen chemistry. <br /> <br /> The Canadian ratings, once again, of Ontario slipped away with a 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba slapped the 40-year-old virgin with an 18A. The same thing happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more for that. To all your fellow teenagers in the United States: good luck sneaking up! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Carell offers one of the funniest performances I've ever seen and almost everybody in the cast distributes laughter relentlessly. Everyone will love the 40 year old Virgin this summer and encourage everyone to see it as quickly as possible. It is the best comedy of the year, hands down. The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers and, of course, the latest memorable comedy by Apatow and Carell, Anchorman, are all over the world. <br /> <br /> It is a comic masterpiece and deserves the considerable amount of praise from critics who have been loving it. Each of my favorite critics loved it and immediately deserves a place in the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a big star. Watch one of the brightest of the summer now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively ?? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
