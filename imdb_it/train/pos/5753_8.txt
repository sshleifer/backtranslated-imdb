*** 1/2 Out of ***** While I am not interested in the fact that it is a dubbed English version as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, since it seems to reside in many native Quebec hearts. However, this was a child's movie of which I was a fervent admirer; bearing in mind that it was created for children, I consider it on a relative basis. The story is of children during the winter break who build a very strong snow fort and push back and forth for control with weapons like snowballs and other concoctions, while lazy hands and free time are equivalent to winter break lessons. If I had children, this is definitely a film, I would try to interest them, since the snow fort excited me as a young man, and I think that even today children would agree, even if with Pixar and all the computer animation , maybe I'm obsolete and simply don't realize it. Furthermore, the message of the film is wonderfully allegorical and positive for children (and adults).
