Ok, at first it seemed "Shrek" - the loner who is followed persistently by comic relief. Then it evolves into something really compelling, like the gauntlet is set. And the result is a funny film, which has moments that I agree are a little too dramatic for the children to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has obviously been worked for a long time, so that they can succeed in creating a film set with sets that are not practically different (only polar caps and rocks) and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they can do something emotional. As I said, sometimes it can be tear-jerky, so, guys, be careful. The real disappointment is the animation. This wasn't so rigged as the toy story films or shrek, and shows. Humans are not realistic and we have already seen better examples of CGI. But don't let this stain the record: as a single effort, "Ice Age" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that little mouse are priceless, and the show-steal.
