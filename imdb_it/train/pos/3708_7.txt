A lawyer is involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse when involved in a femme fatale in this adaptation of a novel by Grisham. Altman creates a suspended and gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Hitting a Southern accent, Branagh is as convincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is tempting as an object of his desire. Downey is likeable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which doesn't allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger complete the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the film gets bogged down and doesn't keep its initial promises, but Altman always deserves a visit.
