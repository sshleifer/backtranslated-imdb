Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in prison for a perfect shot. Since he is behind bars and cannot do it alone, he must leave it to his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). There are five boys who organize the crime - five boys with very little brain capacity. Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It's a criminal comedy that is often very funny. You can't help but laugh when everything goes wrong with these guys. There are some great actors playing these characters. William H. Macy plays Riley. Isaiah Washington is Leon. Sam Rockwell is Pear. Michael Jeter is Toto. Andy Davoli is Basil. Gabrielle Union plays her love interest Michelle. love interest of Pero Carmela. George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the boy tattooed on a wheelchair. This is a very funny movie. I definitely recommend it.
