I complained to ABC about the six degree cancellation. If enough people do the same, it might be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life !! Just go to the official website and the rest is quite simple. I don't understand why this show has been canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is compelling vision! I'm amazed that my favorite show is over after just one series. Why is this? Six degrees are phenomenal, it's better than many other TV programs out there! Until I knew they were stopping him from a friend, it hadn't even occurred to me that this could happen.
