Spoiler! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic destroy this movie in a review on the 10:00 news, I wanted to see it. I don't remember who he was, or what local Omaha news bulletin brought the review, but the critic was very insistent that this movie was too petty for the typical Nebraska in church. They showed a fragment of the scene where John Glover is going to kidnap Ann-Margret while swimming in the pool. Glover's character is praising her for how beautiful her body is, and so on, using many words that the local station felt needed to change. I was hooked. There was a problem, though. At the time I was only 13 years old and had to wait a year until it came out by cable. Let's just say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If ever there was my guilty pleasure, this film is just that. Calling this bleak movie would be an understatement. The film focuses on a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small junk after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is more than ever effective, plays the poor boy who just wanted some adventure and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrifying villains. The character of John Glover is one of the most memorable balls of all time. It's shabby, sometimes funny, and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there's the character of Robert Trebor (nice name, by the way!) Who is clearly in the lead with this blackmail scheme. He's a whining, sweaty, coward who runs a peep show seat with live nude models. So, you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a brooding sociopath who is all afraid of a good reason. Who could forget the alarm bell that gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he is facing, Scheider turns the tables into these chills and takes control of the situation, that is until Glover chases his wife! The conflict takes place brutally, with practically the whole cast fired, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I love this movie so much. It should really scare me, but it doesn't. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting, and the story has many possibilities that many movies today would never prove. It is frightening to think that the adult film industry probably has more than one character like Glover running around L.A. looking for trouble. Just think of his voice to make me laugh. "Hey sport, good day!" <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of shootings, fantastic machines, fantastic dialogues (like the sentence in my opening statement) and decent acting. Lots of cameos from real porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy having fun in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene in place of Glover. <br /> <br /> Another thing I must add: how hot are women in this film ??? Wow! Travolta did well by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that Vanity undresses in a moment before she becomes a born again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessence of American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> So says the Hound. <br /> <br /> Added 14 February 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
