Fantastic movie One to excite all 5 senses. It is not a true historical report and not all information should be considered as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, such as the reproduction of a list and VERY attractive actors such as "heroes", such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - l 'Ned right-hand man', and unattractive actors (sorry Geoffrey Rush) play drunk and corrupt Victorian police force. This also instills a very unreliable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all romantics, as females are particularly sensitive. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the young fat man from drowning and his father calls him "sun" and had a "twinkle in his eyes as he looked at me, his hand on my shoulder", he is very romantic and persuades spectators alongside Ned Kelly, the loser. Also, don't all Australians love a loser?
