Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this 1940 biographical film by Mrs. Leslie Carter which also features Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne and an excellent cast of secondary actors, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful shows. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs Carter. Rains is as great as the flamboyant selfish producer / writer / actor / manager David Belasco, one of the great names in theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, was a consultant for this film, it is a terrible representation of the real events in Mrs. Carter's life. True, there was a very publicized and bitter divorce, and it was undoubtedly seen as a scandalous character for this and to become an actress. However, he had custody of his son Dudley, so there was no battle for custody. Once she broke up with Belasco, she didn't come back to him and, in fact, she started working in vaudeville and actually made some films towards the end of her life. He really married Lou, and became his protagonist in many productions. <br /> <br /> The driving force for Ms. Carter at the beginning of this film is to regain custody of her son, but eventually realizes that far from him, he is completely tied to his father. In the film also (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) he traveled with his mother and lived in a theatrical pension, which gives the film some interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a representation of the size of Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot braids. Offstage, the fans discovered her hair as she hung 35 feet over the stage holding the center of a bell to keep it from ringing. Fairly visual.
