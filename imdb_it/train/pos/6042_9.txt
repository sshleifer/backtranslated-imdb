Short of films to rent, I took Freebird. I struggled for the first third of the film to wonder if the rest would be a waste to see. Fortunately, it really got warm, and I loved the movie quite a bit. The second part of the film made me smile and laugh all the time. Fortunately, even if there were some pieces of CGI included, they were not excessive or prevalent. <br /> <br /> I must say, though - the actors all have heavy European accents, so be careful if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and will have to order a copy for my collection.
