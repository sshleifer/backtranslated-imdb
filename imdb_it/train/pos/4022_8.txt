Another detailed work on the subject of Dr Dwivedi takes us back in time to the pre-partialized Panjab. Dr Dwivedi has chosen a difficult topic for his film debut. He worked on all the meticulous details to give life to the story. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Even though we were not in the region at that time, the sets and costumes seem real. Unlike most of the films made on the partition, this one does not focus on the gory details of violence to attract the public, but on its side effects. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee gave an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai played his heart showing the difficult situation of a man full of guilt. The rest of the cast also did a good job.
