Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and don't be happy. That woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. This is a tough combination to find a day now. And Jeremy Northam. I've heard his name many times, but I've never really noticed it. My advice for Hollywood is "use it more". <br /> <br /> movie time: I saw it in one of my graveyard shifts. I don't recommend it to anyone. It's a bit complicated and mysterious for that. I still can't believe I didn't see the ending coming. I will not say what cause this will ruin the hole in the film. although to say that this is a sufficient deterrent. <br /> <br /> I now suppose I cast my vote on this film. I love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job and I love the (native) directors of the past. There is not a large audience for this kind of thing, this is also quite risky. you know what, I'll give this job to 8 because everyone should see it. Then again, 1 deduction point because there is always room for improvement.
