In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered with agonizing sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months Jonny decided to collaborate with director Patrick Collerton to document his life and his death, and the result was a film, broadcast for the first time in March, which was an exciting story, confusing and provocatively fun of a singular man. Not moving away from the sad reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and presented for the first time in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off became the most discussed documentary of that year. It attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to Jonny's charitable organization, DEBRA. A memorial fund of Jonny Kennedy was set up to raise another half million with the aim of ensuring that Jonny Kennedy left a legacy of one million pounds.
