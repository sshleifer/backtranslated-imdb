The film was absolutely fantastic and fantastic. The graphics were superb and it was fantastic. Above all, Flik was superb and fantastic in the film and he was funny and he was, sometimes he was smart. Circus insects are colorful and superb in the film. The grasshoppers were also superb and beautiful in the film. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Also, Dot was cute. When the bird comes to eat the insects, that scene was superb and good. Even the last scene was fantastic and fantastic. Flik's inventions were also good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare the grasshoppers. When the ants are building the artificial bird, that scene was beautiful and pleasant, I really should have appreciated the creators of "A Bug's Life".
