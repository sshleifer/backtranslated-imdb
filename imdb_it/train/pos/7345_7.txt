Collected the film at the flea market for $ 4, it certainly made my money count! They might not interest the sexy girls but the animation simply blew me away after a steady Simpson diet (sorry Mr. Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend multiple views with some fantastic tracks, good friends and a couple of cool ones!
