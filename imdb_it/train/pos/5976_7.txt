Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This film, a puzzle game, revolves around the '80s culture of heavy metal and horror movies - two things I love a lot. So, as you can imagine, I liked this movie quite easily. Also, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all of us losers, ended up immersed in a world of "bad" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, he is miraculously resurrected - playing his latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and helping them lend a hand. <br /> <br /> Okay, sometimes it's pretty bad, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is music. Ironic, eh? Well, this "uber-evil" metal guy is one of the most hateful, high-pitched, plaintive, discarded of Motley Crue on the planet - and the "Metal" is little more than the putrid 80s Pop / Hair Metal. It affects all the clich√©s here, from going around like a gay fairy, to looking mediocre, to screaming "Rock and Roll !!!" in a tone high enough to make King Diamond vomit. Apart from that atrocious musical representation, it is actually quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
