I'm surprised how many people give this move to less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they don't understand the film. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing up in a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> There's a crazy granny who really wants the best for your grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there's a good reason why so many critics appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> And the reason is because they understand the film. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the low scores given by some people. <br /> <br /> I wish I could write a short summary of a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Frankly I have nothing else to say.
