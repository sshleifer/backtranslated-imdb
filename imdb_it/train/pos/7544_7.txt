Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to go out with films like these, films that eventually end up on anime-fan records and college student plans, but are completely ignored by virtually no one outside his country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from the Western eyes, should be tested with drugs or deeply analyzed. In reality, it's just a wonderfully detailed surrealist journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue, which makes it easy to switch to other interested parties not interested in things like subtitles. A cat and his dead half-sister (cerebrally dead?) Travel through various landscapes of imagination and association. Is there a general theme of water, or its lack (perhaps because of the cat that drowns at the beginning? Perhaps because of the title?). There is an interesting type of taking Genesis. There is a pig that you can eat alone. An elephant made of water. And it's gorgeous, addictive, exciting and fun - provided you don't look around junkies who can't experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid journey. Eventually the film goes out, adding another compelling self-reflexive level to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
