At the beginning of the film we see May and Toots getting ready for their trip to London for a visit to their grown children. You can see that Toots is not in good health, but goes on. When he suddenly dies, May's world begins to spin out of control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a script by Hanif Kureshi, is a study on how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening in a world that does not he even knows he exists until now. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban wife was probably boring. Obviously his sex life was almost nothing. We know he had a brief extra marital relationship, so nothing at all. When May loses her husband, she can't go home, so instead she stays behind with her grandson at her daughter's house. It is in this scenario that May begins to desire the young and tough Darren, the occasional lover of her daughter. <br /> <br /> In May Darren wakes up a passion he has never known. May responds by turning before our eyes. May, who is sloppy at the beginning of the film, suddenly starts dressing, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. He ends up falling headlong with this young man who keeps her satisfied with a passion he never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having known a couple of cases similar to this story, it was no surprise to me to look at May's reaction. His possibility of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends up frustrating May, who realizes how beautiful his sex with Darren is. The younger man, we think, is alone in this matter to satisfy himself and for a chance to extort money from May. Eventually, her daughter, Helen, discovers what her mother did behind her when she discovered the erotic paintings her mother made. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May. Daniel Craig is also incredible. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Even Anna Wilson Jones in the role of Helen is vital to the story as it is she who has to face her mother about what is happening behind her. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part like Bruce, the oldest man in Helen's class and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The film is rewarding for those who see it with an open mind. <br /> <br />
