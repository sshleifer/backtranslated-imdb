Eddie Murphy spends his time searching for lost children, so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet, sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help to save this child from the clutches of evil itself. <br /> <br /> Even if the story is a bit silly, it never seems trivial, despite the hilarity of the comedy during the film; Charles Dance off-set the comedy with its very serious and obscure characterization of the evil that keeps the child hostage. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is a lot of fun, full of action and really quite engaging in a fascinating, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Excellent for all generations.
