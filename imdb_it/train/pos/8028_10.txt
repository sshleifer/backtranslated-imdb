This is the best movie I've ever seen !!! Thomas Beckett and Richard Miller - two men who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madnes, a shot - one killed !!? You have to kill, if you have any doubts about something, you MUST survive !! <br /> <br /> P.P.- I appreciate my bad / worst / english !!!
