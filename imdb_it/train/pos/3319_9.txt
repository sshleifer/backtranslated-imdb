A long time Red Sox fan, I just had to go see the movie. It was great! While there can never be enough footage from the miracle of the Red Sox 2004 season, there have been great hits from some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the film is definitely a hit movie, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 films of all time. I particularly liked Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben meets up with his friends at the draft day to determine who will get seats at certain games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date or other significant ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and especially if you are a Red Sox fan !!!
