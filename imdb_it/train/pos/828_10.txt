I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this is not even in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad reputation due to the Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - The Rescue of Han Solo by Jabba: this officer wraps Han Solo in the debt subplot that was established when we met the character in A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> - The emperor was finally revoked: well, okay, this may not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as a child. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Well, so this was a moment of special effects. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! <br /> <br /> - The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Guided by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Faces his father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment) <br /> <br /> - The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: As I said, this movie has a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's pretty nice that while the whole galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE IMPERO, our heroes have a private party in the woods with one another. <br /> <br /> All in all it was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting conclusion to the STAR WARS story.
