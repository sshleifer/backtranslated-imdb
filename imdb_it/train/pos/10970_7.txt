A fascinating but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie), aunt and first cousin until the late Jasi√®ne Kennedy Onasis. They live in a haunted and dilapidated building, considered a danger to the health of the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are eccentric far beyond. Little Edie seems to be the most offensive while acting with the mentality of a ten-year-old girl even though she actually has 53. The content is practically composed of two things. The first are the conversations in which Little Edie eludes Big Edie for dismissing all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, meaningless and often amusing. The second part consists of long lines of attempted singing by both sides. Each of them thinks that their song is perfect and only the other sounds bad. In a surprising scene, Big Edie physically attacks little Edie with his stick just to make her stop warbling. Very appealing, but one has the feeling that theirs is a serious exploitation here and that the subjects are too far away to know. Filmmakers seem to treat it as a circus freak show, which comes every day to record (and giggle) any bizarre behavior that may happen. Ultimately, this is a sad image as it shows how the world has simply overcome these two. Their hopes and dreams have lapsed as the dwelling they live in. Despite their quarrels, these two need each other more than ever. Because without the other there would have been no refuge from solitude. The most surprising line comes from Big Edie, whose numerous cats relax in his bedroom. His response to a smell complaint is simply incredible.
