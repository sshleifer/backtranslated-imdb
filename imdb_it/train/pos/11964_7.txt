I went to the movies this afternoon expecting to be run over by Scoop. Fortunately, the film has exceeded expectations, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing profound - and nowhere as good as any number of real masterpieces of Allen - but it's also completely enjoyable as a light and playful comedy. There is something simple and sweet about it. "Cute" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they came out after the show. It does not seem that Allen has decided to create a masterpiece here, it seems to want to do a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to almost everything that Hollywood is producing, Allen's stuff has a tendency to enchantment. Even the soft things. These days it is simply refreshing to go to a movie made by a real human being.
