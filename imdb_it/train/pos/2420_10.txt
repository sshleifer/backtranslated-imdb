If you like the actions and subtle reactions (yes, I said thin) of John Candy, you can't help but appreciate this film (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The unobserved (and uninformed) observer always saw Candy as a great actor: a great buffoon. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But, when given the opportunity, it could really be very sharp and very thin. Too bad he was hired in so many roles that showed only his broader side, because we will never see each other again. Oh, yes, the movie. You can watch "Going Berserk" over and over again (I know I have) with "Caddyshack" frequency. It's so beautiful. The plot, although a little twisted, is actually deep enough for a farce of this type. It allows Candy and the increasingly underrated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce on Candy ... and bounce off HARD. Definitely worth a look for anyone who has enjoyed SCTV or other Candy work.
