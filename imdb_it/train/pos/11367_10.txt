Warning: it may contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie 3 times and enjoyed it every time. After seeing it again, I am always reminded of how beautiful it is. An HBO TV film - very well done like most of their films - would have received Oscars for its performances if it had been released for general distribution instead of TV. <br /> <br /> As I'm sure someone knows by reading other reviews here, this is the story of a serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be found, so he was sentenced for 52 out of 53 of his murders). The story focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man who becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles posed by the party's hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very moving scene towards the end of the film that mentions how in America, investigators are regularly taken away by serial killer cases after 18 months, whether they like it or not because of mental tension and frustration. According to this agreement, Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case up to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him that he admires his dedication and apologizes for not having known he should have given him a break first. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is so good done, don't overdo it, chew the scenery or do something that distracts you from his portrait of a man who's determined to find his killer. He is a man with passion, but does not show it in the same way that he is usually depicted in detective films. Only occasionally does he give outbursts after quietly enduring more than most could bear in such circumstances. Rea does so much with her face, her eyes, she doesn't need to overdo it. Except that * is * - His character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven by frustration, actually says he'd rather find 3 at a time than anyone in a year. Obviously what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. It makes us understand, but see what it means to live with such horror and futility. <br /> <br /> A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was the one that produces such "monsters". The character of Chikatilo is very well made by Jeffrey DeMunn. In some way (as impossible as it may seem), he arouses a little sympathy for himself. Maybe it's the worst of us that went terribly wrong? In any case, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He begins to look like a cynical worldly official who doesn't seem much more interested in helping anyone else's investigation by blocking Burakov. But in the end he becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a nice turn of Max Von Sydow when the psychiatrist made his entrance to help the profile and understand what kind of deviants they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film is a morbid, grotesque and violent story, in reality it is more about what it takes to capture a murderer than the killer himself. All around a very well done film with excellent performances and a great script. The script manages to do what makes the best of this type of film: give concrete events and position them significantly within a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know people * behind * the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
