Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western looks like Real McCoy, compelling, funny, spectacular; As a true TV DEADWOOD fan, I'll tell you about Gary Cooper's performances like Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are much more focused. <br /> <br /> We have no more giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that saw a decade of commercial life decade after decade: released, re-issued, reissued again. Filmmakers like Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer today are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's films will be searched in 7 months to say nothing of 70 years.
