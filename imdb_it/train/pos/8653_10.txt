I just finished watching "Kalifornia" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer movies, that "Kalifornia" would be among the first movies worthy of mention, but has not. Perhaps if this film had been published between 1996-1999, perhaps it would have been more successful. In my opinion, "Kalifornia" is very different from most serial killer movies published in the late 90s. It has an atmosphere almost completely different from most of today's serial killer films like "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies have shown a murderer, but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough to actually learn something about them. "Kalifornia" is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. Do you try to answer questions such as "why do they do the things they do? Is it the fault of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they love the thrill of killing?" These are some of the things to which "Kalifornia" tries to answer, but also leaves room for us to try to understand things for ourselves. Brad Pitt has a timeless imprint like Early Grayce. When we meet for the first time at the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously a disturbed individual. When we see it for the first time, it is night. Soon he may be drunk. We see him then take a stone, throw it from a bridge, and then land on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is proud in this film. It's always nice to see him when he plays psychopaths or really bad people. It is strange that this would later lead him to interpret a real loon as in "12 Monkeys" and that he would be on the other side of the spectrum in "Seven" by David Fincher.
