I just have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera woke up his body after everything was shaved and nice for his first trip to Gilley, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, offers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the attitude necessary to marry a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a country music person, which I was not, this is a soundtrack that will have you singing along with every word. If you have the chance, watch this movie: it won't disappoint.
