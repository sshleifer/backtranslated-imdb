In Carmen, Saura tries once again to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the real passions of personalities in a dance company that prepares the choreography for the dance parts of the opera Carmen and the passions written by the history of Carmen imaginary, the famous fatal mix of a free spirit (read the disdain for loyalty) and his ability to guide men mad with desire. Saura used this same science fiction / reality film in a previous black and white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But, while the tensions between the dancers who rehearsed Blood Wedding showed how they evolved in the imaginary characters of the story to be performed directing their emotions in their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the petty, libidinal solicitations of the dancers of the troop the trials and the spirit that has to do with the mythical Carmen never even comes close to being credible. It remains a gadget and, for this reason, an annoying distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it does not matter, the Saura melodrama tries to impose its Carmen, because the flamenco dance and the guitar music of the rehearsals which are 95% of the film of some of the most famous dancers and musicians of Flamenco, repays the registration price . An imperfect film and a wonder: perfect for doing an exercise in Keats's "negative ability", perhaps?
