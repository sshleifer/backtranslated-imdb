This movie was fun but for the wrong reasons. The coordination of the action sequences is ridiculous and makes the film have some fun slap moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together towards the end, where Williamson tells Ginty, "you're sure you go around friend!" I liked this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the plot that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest was more likely. A film with over 30 parts has only a list of credits for 10 or so. It seems strange that no one else has merit in the film, maybe they had some idea of ​​what the finished product would look like. The only thing this film has in store is that it is quite violent, so it has tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty for a film that is worth seeing.
