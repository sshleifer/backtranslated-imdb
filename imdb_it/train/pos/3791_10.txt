Our song is a wonderful example of passionate, film making at its best aesthetic. It is, in effect, a true wonder of a film; a penetrating and insightful work of art that tells the life of three young girls (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) during a particular summer in their lives, when the concerns of their approaching adulthood will force each of them to do a series of difficult, life altering the choices that will probably redefine who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to each other for years to come. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and orderly. There is no sentimentality, free sentimentality, nor are there clich√© solutions ridden in this film. What we see here sometimes seems to have a very real heart. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you like - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit to the spirit of the film goes to its main actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is incredibly powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, shamelessly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently do, the performance of these three as apathetic or non-emotional. In fact, their peaceful charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their crude, sometimes unconventional intelligence throughout the film, are absolutely compelling. One should be completely "out of the world" with, or completely indifferent, the behavior of adolescents to lose the resounding authenticity in what these three young women wear on the screen. Similarly, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, compliments the work of the three girls and the general tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie not to be missed - by anyone of any age
