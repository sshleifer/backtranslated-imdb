I must confess that I did not read the original story of R James even though I read many of his other supernatural stories. I've also seen most of the BBC's previous Christmas Ghost Stories and this, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, equaling only The Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can't really criticize A View From a Hill - the direction and 'mood' are perfect, as well as acting, lighting and, of course, history and writing. I really enjoyed this and can only hope to get more of this quality from the director and the production team. I understand that the BBC plans to do something more (not necessarily based on the stories of R James), so it's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
