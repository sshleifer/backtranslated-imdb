When my current college-age daughter was a preschooler, this miniseries appeared on A & E from 8-9am every morning. My neighbor and I made a deal not to miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late at the nursery every morning all week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten how much I loved this movie until I pulled out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very nice, but perfect as a Rochester. The dark and steep face, the imperious behavior tempered by humor and tenderness came directly from the pages of the book. Even if Dalton eats some set design, I couldn't sit down with an adaptation starring Wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get involved in romance. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She died like Jane, silent, formal, saying volumes at a glance. The sparkle in his eyes gives viewers a taste of the strength and animated nature that helped Jane survive the abuse she suffered in her youth. The criticism of his interpretation of "wood" is out of place. A servant in an adequate English family would have maintained such an attitude, but he speaks passionately when he is overcome with emotion. Unlike many other Janes, she appears clear enough to be Jane, but nice enough to let the public buy Rochester's attraction for her. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue is a big part of why the book resists the script. of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interaction between Jane and Rochester with wit and silent intensity. Although Jane appears as simple and sweet as a vanilla cream, she refuses to be intimidated by the dark and irritated Rochester. The two cables reproduce beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance ever.
