Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his companions embark on a space mission that sees them fly through Saturn's rings. His companions are killed instantly, but it would seem that they are actually the luckiest. Steve returns to Earth a constantly moist mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer, melting away at every stage of the journey, he is tracked down by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> This is often so incredibly fun - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - it's hard for me to believe that laughter isn't all intentional. It seems to me a kind of effort for the low-budget genre efforts of the 50s and 60s, and as such is a wonderfully entertaining film. That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We are even treated to a split screen sequence that adds nothing, but is still a gas to watch. <br /> <br /> The writer / director William Sachs deserves the credit for having invented this brilliant idea; his ultra-thin character is truly memorable. I think his rhythm is a little low; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go a little too long, but in the end it offers solid products, schlock, B-movie with a certain degree of panache. The climax is particularly fun. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is pleasantly shuddery (but also fun in some moments), and the cinematography of Willy Curtis sometimes creates really great shots. This brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and convincing make-up effects, which form a respectable centerpiece for the film, until the final breakup. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under heavy make-up for almost the entire movie (Sachs is also my praise for the fact that the film was successful) and does what it needs to do quite well. DeBenning is a rather stupid and silly hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as sexy as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are in favor. It is also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (doing an appreciable topless shot), Janus Blythe ("Eaten Alive" by Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes" by Wes Cravens), and even director Jonathan Demme in a little way. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining midnight movie with enough coolness, chills and laughter to rank it as worthy of catch for low-level science fiction / horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
