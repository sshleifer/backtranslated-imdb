Like his first masterpiece "The Elephant Man", Lynch demonstrates to his detractors that he can tell a simple and linear story without losing his artistic touch. This is the true story of an elderly pensioner (expertly interpreted by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor through some states to make one last visit to his stranger brother who is now at the door of death. A beautiful soundtrack by Badalamenti, an exquisite photograph of rural life (I love those aerial shots on the wheat field) and a sly director's hand that reveals the basic humanity of man, this is a nice slice of life film. Its extremely slow pace can put some spectators to sleep, but those who remain for the journey will be well rewarded in the end.
