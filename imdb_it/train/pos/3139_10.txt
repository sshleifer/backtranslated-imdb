There are many types of reunion shows. One type is one in which the old actors are taken out of mothballs and start recreating characters who haven't played for twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. `Return to Mayberry ', despite some nonsense, was fine; `Return to Green Acres' as execrable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script that I will not repeat here, but both the film and the stink); "Rescue from Gilligan's Island" has filled a gap in the castaways' history, although the show itself was foolish even from the point of view of "Gilligan's Island". In most cases, the scripts are weak; sometimes a stupidity appears in the scripts which is too much to know ?? and in comedy it is almost always fatal for the characters to know that they are funny. New characters are introduced that don't fit the mix. Overall, these reunion shows are pretty weak. A second kind of "reunion" show is the type in which the cast sets aside the past, but sits around, telling stories, reminiscing, interspersed with flashbacks of the shows. Then there are films based on shows, which are rarely good; and films based on the history of the show (`The Brady Bunch 'has had both of these events, with various results). <br /> <br /> `Return to the Batcave 'uses almost all of the above, with a wonderfully twisted point of view, which makes it the best of reunion shows, and has raised the bar for others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward are summoned for a screening of the original Batmobile. While I'm there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> The Adam West of the film is a demented man. He called Jerry, his butler, "Alfred". He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking lot. He is obsessed with being a crime fighter, while in reality he is just a tearful actor. When the Batmobile is stolen, not only does he believe it is his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, he drags Burt Ward as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The chase is largely talkative, with West and Ward remembering in the old days. It's broken by "flashbacks" with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. The modern scenes and the "flashbacks" both have the strange lack of reality that the show has maintained. There are also gags that show that West is able to make fun of himself: in Ward's book about his time on the show, he spoke openly about West's libido and its being a skin crease (West charges Ward everything in their search, down to tips and bus fare). The following clues, the characters they meet (even in the flashback) all conform to the mentality of the old series, and there are several tributes, including a fist fight with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is extremely fun and done with great verve. There are also cameos of Julie Newmar (it seems he has had too much of a facelift) and Frank Gorshin, who reminds us why he has such a sectarian following. Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, will be long forgotten. The film is based on a fairly obvious but fun climax. <br /> <br /> Is this show a model for reunion shows ?? unfortunately, there are few that can adapt to the scheme. This show has seen actors playing their old characters; young actors who play a film about the performance of the show; the actors West and Ward who remember; and a modern movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West. It has everything. If you loved the old show, this is the cap on the bottle.
