Although this was a box office disaster, it's my favorite movie. It gives a powerful family message. She has a lot of violence and has a song with a group of girls in bikinis. Compared to other Bollywood films, the action scenes in this film are more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays him in this film. Don't read the reviews of the critics, they are simply ignorant. This film has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and above all action. So, if you want to see a more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is the movie.
