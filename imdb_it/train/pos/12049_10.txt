I gave this film a 10/10 reluctantly as it is difficult to praise something that has haunted me and terrified me for years. The sheer threat to the woman in black is just pure horror and the accompanying music worsens the terror. <br /> <br /> I saw it when it was the first time on TV when I was 10 and it really disturbed me for years. I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have already said it. Many film festivals talk about how disturbing or terrifying a film can be, but you can believe all those who have posted on this forum, this is really incredibly powerful stuff. I mean, I really like horror movies and I generally find them pretty funny most of the time, but this is really threatening and will probably disturb most people. I haven't seen him since I was 10 and I'm tempted to look at him again but I'm afraid I have some sleepless nights. I can't understand what it is exactly, but I think it's something to do with the fact that fear is Donna's greatest weapon and that we, as spectators, are just as sensitive as we fear fear so intensely. It is extraordinary that the feelings of the other spectators are so unanimous. I also saw the play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can be compared to this.
