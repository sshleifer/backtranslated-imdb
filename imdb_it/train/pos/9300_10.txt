I don't know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed to me a little too self-conscious. So when I call it one of my all-time favorites, it has nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time talks about symbolism, not realism. It is Kafkaesque (a pity that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when he was as good as Josef K), he is elegant, wise, sardonic and lucid. Jeff Goldblum is browsing around a variety of characters, trying not to get shot and acting skillfully rather than laboring, trying to keep up with what he knows and others not, who can find and who can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball, and the supporting cast looks perfect. The symbolism, the settings (the only external movement filmed with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really strange after so much lizardry lounge), the dialogue (style, not practicality, is on the agenda), concerns the characters that interact, not really gangsterism. Fun to watch, it must have been fun to do. What critics were doing is really a mystery ...
