A typical overblown melodrama of his period (mid-50s) and appropriate matinee food. Rock Hudson, the hulk that everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotypical role, but while in Giant, made the same year, when his material and his co-stars (Taylor and Dean) were above average, in this movie is just not good enough to elevate the caliber beyond a cheesy tale of how hard it is to be both rich and happy. Self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, who makes his way into the film with drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone, playing a poor rich and poor girl, totally over the top) end up losing and Hudson takes Bacall - which is rather wood in this part that does not have enough character or spirit to keep it going. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the happy ending happily and the unhappy villain, this is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested in reading that the film is based on a true story that confirmed the plot. Like other films of the period, homosexuality is camouflaged in heterosexual terms. Perhaps the film could be redone: Stack's character would be truer if he hid the homosexual feelings for Mitch by getting married. Todd Haynes's Far From Heaven has greatly improved with All That That Heaven, also directed by Sirk. Maybe Haynes could do Written on the Wind and give us a truly memorable film.
