it's hard to tell you more about this movie without ruining it. I enjoyed it because I didn't expect what I was seeing, but a normal sexual drama like that ... It's a pscyho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems. He presents Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger to the genre (and nudity) in which her husband, Polanski, had directed her. And a disturbing performance (I said disturbing / yes CREEPY) by Toreton (the actor of Bernard Tavernier). It looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like a Chabrol gone off track or a Clouzot thriller (I saw someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to Les Yeux sans Visage by Georges Franju (Eyes with no face, the godfather of Dr. Phibes and other). A gem! I'm just afraid they turn it into a Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
