This film is like marmite. Either you love it or you hate it. If you go to this movie waiting for an appropriate movie with decent production values, a good storyline and great characters will hate you. If you go to this movie expecting a low budget slasher you will probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie you would expect to see one of the most unbalanced characters ever filmed in the form of Harry Russo you will love. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his exaggerated portrait of the mad and deadly enemy of cocaine. <br /> <br /> The special effects are at most abysmal, but who cares? If you are the kind of person who is ready to watch a Schizophrenic movie: The Whore Mangler you have surely seen dozens of horror movies full of blood. With the budget this film was made even if they had tried it probably would have been mediocre at best. I'd rather laugh at something abysmal than be influenced by the mediocre. <br /> <br /> In summary, you will probably hate this movie but if you are one of the few to decide to see it anyway it will become the best thing since slicing bread # 2 I hate marmite.
