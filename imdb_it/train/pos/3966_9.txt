JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started collaborating with the agency before he was called FBI and the story involves the Ku Klux Klan, the prohibitionist-era gangsters, German and Japanese spies of World War II, etc. years of history; far superior to all the films made these days. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest to older viewers who are familiar with Washington, DC. In a scene of about 20 minutes in the film --- where James Stewart discovers from Vera Miles that he expects their first child --- the scene was shot in Herzog's fish restaurant in the former Washington Waterfront, the only film in which this history the position appears. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was an eyesore and had to be shot down. By decree that is suited to its position of undisputed sovereignty, the entire area, including the famous waterfront restaurant district, but excluding 3 historic churches; has been reduced to rubble. Black residents evicted from their homes transferred as best they could and without federal assistance; in the same way companies have simply been taken out of the market, few being re-located. The Row restaurant has been turned into a sidewalk and Washington has no waterfront (restaurants, fish stalls, boats, etc.) for about 10 years. As a lifetime resident, the Herzog restaurant scene was our first motivation to see this beautiful film again.
