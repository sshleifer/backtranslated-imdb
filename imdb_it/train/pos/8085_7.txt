One thing I can say about this movie is a long one, VERY LONG! Actually, I recently bought this movie a couple of months ago, seeing a new version coming out. I was happy to discover that it was made in 1978 because the 70s (even though I never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! when I saw this movie the story was actually very good at first, but after about 50 minutes it started to get very boring and repetitive. I admit that the animation impressed me! it was nothing I had ever seen before and it was nice enough to see. but the film, honestly, could have been a little better, could have talked a lot more and told a story rather than just scenes from 15 to 20 minutes that had just had ruthless fights. then in the last 5 or 10 minutes the film resumed and recovered well but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion I thought it was EXTREMELY long. I know her 13 minutes in 2 hours and it's still a long time for a cartoon, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it look like it was 4 hours long !!!! but overall it's an acceptable film and I think I'll watch it again in one of those "days not to do". I will see the new one and I hope it is better!
