You have never entered your life, you went out for a sport, you did your best and then you found yourself in an important part of it, where for a brief moment you were given the chance to be a hero and a champion is. . . failed? I believe many of us have had that moment in our lives. This is the premise of the film, "The Best of Times". In this story a middle-aged banker, named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), suffers from the profound melancholy of a soccer error, which happened years ago, inspired to re-play the game. . yet. To achieve this, he must convince the great football quarterback, Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell), to make a comeback. For Reno, who is satisfied with his present game in life, it is not necessary to change the past record, which is better as he gets older. Besides both, their problem is the fact that years have passed and, moreover, both of their marriages are in trouble and need re-vampires. It is not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the biggest drop. However, Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try to correct the biggest mistake of his life. Great fun for all those who wish to enjoy their youth again. ***
