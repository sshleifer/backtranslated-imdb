I happily admit to being a sucker for a good film, and the inventive movements and angles of the machine can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. It is not a Gojoe length, although it has had some of the most notable cinemas I have seen since the Korean MUSA period. However, Gojoe offers much more than just beautiful images (as MUSA does ... there is no point in implying a contrast) - it is the second greatest strength is the superb acting, and a fascinating story with a very obscure philosophy. I have to admit that I'm not sure what was the point he was trying to make in the end, but it certainly causes some thoughts along the way. The vague ones, but surely thoughts: p <br /> <br /> A department where the film could have been better is the action. There is a huge amount of bloodletting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and often obscured by foreground objects. He creates some very intense and impressive images, but it would have been nice to see some more real moves, something to make more credible that the wicked could simply wade through entire armies devastating everyone. <br /> <br /> However, the film is certainly one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've seen in a while. Recommended!
