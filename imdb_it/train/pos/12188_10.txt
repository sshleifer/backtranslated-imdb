The genius of Pure Orson Welles makes this one of the greatest films. Welles is involved in a murderous conspiracy only to be created as the fallen boy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big mannequin I am". The plot is so complex that I still don't know if the victim knew his life was going to be lost. The shooter scene in the mirror carnival hall is one of the most incredible ever shot. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. This was the only time Rita Hayworth played a complex but credible character. Nobody, apart from Welles, would have had the courage to cut his hair and be dyed a bright blond. No one should lose this image.
