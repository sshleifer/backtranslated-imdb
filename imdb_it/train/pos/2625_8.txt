Surprisingly it is not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's sequels directly on video. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I was pleased that Disney has returned most of the original voice actors that make a big difference and have maintained a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders for a while, but we are distracted by an endless series of jokes ranging from fun to boring. To break the plot and the jokes that have given us stupid musical sequences, which are very similar to jokes, they range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part, MST3K-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and actually don't add much to the film except to serve as a vehicle for an hour's flashback. The new characters are at least nice, and the old characters are doing their thing, so I can't criticize them. Overall this film is not bad and is a nice frivolous filler among Lion King's more serious titles.
