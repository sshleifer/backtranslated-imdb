Before the regular comments, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is that while there is a part-time listed on the 94-minute IMDb, the Wellspring Media DVD in the United States has a duration of 88 minutes. Any input on this is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two friends with very difficult lives take the road to an adventure. This is where they end up, with one who accidentally shot a girl and the two run off into the countryside on foot. Rather than a big chase, the film is complicated by the crazy Spike who behaves inappropriately and tightens his armed chest like a teddy bear. Some viewers might not like the story based solely on Spike's character, but without adding some frustration to the plot, the film would have been too easy. You'll notice how the more stable character Heaton refers to Spike as a "big man" in contrast to Spike's "out-of-control child" attitude and behavior. Honestly, I too have been aggravated by Spike's ridiculous actions, especially spray cans, but in a desperate situation it is clear that someone of his mentality would have chosen a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to keep things under control until things went too well. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan while Heaton is a marvel, and after a while I stopped wondering why the hell he would do I want to take Spike from prison and continue a friendship, due to Glenaan's great performance. After all, there are many many reasons during their run that it would be a good idea for Heaton to abandon Spike and try to save himself. I suppose Heaton felt like a protective older brother of Spike, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break - until things get too desperate. <br /> <br /> While some of the cinematographies are truly artistic, it offers more flavor to the story instead of simple strokes of the men crossing the wild nature. The beautiful landscapes, the rain and the immense gray skies offer a dark tone that increases the feeling of tragic circumstances. The soundtrack is also unusual, and the use of the song "This Is Not A Love Song" by Public Image Ltd. and the title of the film is quite clever. <br /> <br /> In general, it is understandable if you don't mind THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG as it focuses on two contrasting characters fleeing from another man determined to hunt them (played by a cool David Bradley and quiet). It is not a great action entertainment program. For the rest of us who love to look for something minimal and dramatic, it's time that is worth spending, and offers some extremely tense moments that keep you from breathing a little. <br /> <br /> I'm really having a good time Recently, films have been released from Scotland, with characters such as Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I'm also a little grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, obscure and often tense, THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE It is a very tragic but compelling narrative. <br /> <br />
