This film was pretty good. I'm not a big baseball fan, but this film was created to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are brought on stage with a variety of talented and understanding sports actors. The plot was credible and I love the message. William Dear and the boys put together a great film. <br /> <br /> Most sports movies revolve around real stories or events and often don't work well. But this film got a 10 on the perfect scale, although there were some minor mistakes here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
