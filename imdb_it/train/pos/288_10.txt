This movie was awesome! I am a teenager, and my friends and I all love the series, so it just goes to show that these films draw attention to all age groups. I recommend it to everybody. My favorite line in this film is when Logan Bartholomew says "rosy cheeks" when he talks about his little daughter. He is such an exceptional actor, as is Erin Cottrell. They combine so well, and have great chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are such attractive people and they are very good actors. I finally found films that are good to watch. Lately it has been difficult for me to find films that are good and that show good Christian customs and values. But at the same time, these films are not bad.
