I never knew who Robert Wuhl was before he saw it. But after seeing him I realized that I was a funny man. This HBO special offers him to teach "American history" to university film students in New York and the man was simply phenomenal. He joked about almost all the key historical events that occurred not only in the United States, but in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me doubt whether what I accept as the true infallible story is really true. <br /> <br /> I liked how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning much more exciting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history and is willing to question his beliefs.
