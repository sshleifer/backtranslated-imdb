I first saw the film on HBO (probably) in 1981 and, at 15, I thought the film was hilarious. I remember NOT seeing the representations of Alfred E. Neuman shown in the theater trailers. When MAD magazine satiated the film and suddenly stopped halfway through the apology of the "usual band" for lowering itself to the satire of such a piece of shit, I thought they were kidding themselves, but I'm sure they were , but finding them seriously (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credit, I was rather surprised. Surely there are many worse films to be associated with. Watching the film on video now (at the age of 32) with the MAD references restored, I still have a kick from the outside. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his jewel in the crown of shows (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
