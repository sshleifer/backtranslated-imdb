"Come Undone" seems to arouse many opinions among the contributors of this forum. Of course, it is a film that promises a grip on gay life, as most viewers expect and somehow, moves away from that promise in an introspective vision of the soul of a young man. The film has a way of being with us even when it's done. It is a study on the character of how a young man entertains himself in a love story with a person so different from him that in the end he will leave Mathieu confused, hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you'd like to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, the film's director, told his story from Mathieu's point of view. Most viewers seem to be disoriented from different times within the film, but there are suggestions that are not obvious, as can be seen, in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that could add to the way some people see the movie. This is a story about the condemned love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the last collapse of their life together. <br /> <br /> First of all, Cedric, the handsome young local, chases Mathieu until he can convince him that he likes him. Mathieu also feels the attraction for Cedric. We realize how different the two young people are, from the way Cedric tells Mathieu's family how he thinks school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric took it. Let's look at how Mathieu, reading from the guide, wants Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu leaves his mother, she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career. It also indicates the future that both would have had together, which proves to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson the hard way. Switch to an uncertain life with Cedric and try to take his own life. We look at him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The finale could be confusing to most viewers, but there is a moment in the film when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing his glasses and looking intently at Pierre, the young man who goes to the bar. That's why when Mathieu goes to look for Pierre in his house, it seems difficult to imagine. However, we have seen the way in which Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are seen walking on the sand, has a sign of hope that things will get better between them as they watch a boy, apparently lost, but then realize that his father is nearby. > <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand on a simple level. Mathieu suffered a lot, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and the loss of Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has been seen in other major French films, is equally good, as is shallow Cedric. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" will share opinions, the film deserves a vision because of the complexity and care that Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story.
