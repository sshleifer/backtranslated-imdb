Unlike other comments, I found this film fascinating, even with all its flaws and the recitation of the zombies of some actors. <br /> <br /> Being a technologist, I discovered that the experiments are interesting and the hardware is realistic. Although the reading of people's minds by computer sounds fantastic, they are now experimenting to do just that. I will note that these experiments are at a very early stage, with results so far not favorable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film are well expressed. The girl, although exaggerating a little, seems suitable. The truck driver is a bell for the real truckers. The minister transmits doubts at first (the principal investigator tells the minister that he (the minister), is not sure if he believes that God created man or that man created God. But in the moment in which the chips are on the ground, his faith falls back: only the research doctorate interprets the zombie, the secrets they guard are appropriately appropriate for their characters and in the face of death they react as real human beings would do. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning against the dangers of unrestricted surveillance by the government Like a thriller, the film doesn't have enough thrills: as a scientific exercise with philosophical bases it is fascinating.
