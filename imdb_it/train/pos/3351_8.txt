Very good western. This was the first time that screenwriter Richard Wilson directed a film, which was also Samuel Goldwyn's first film as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty girl like a saloon. Robert Mitchum arrives in this city dominated by outlaws and is hired as a city tamer, but people are worried that he will go too far, even for the damage he will do to the city. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" that was created in 1959. This film maintains a very fast and exciting rhythm, it really keeps you on the edge.
