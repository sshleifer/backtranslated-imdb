This was a great movie with a good cast, all hit on all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best, well, there's nothing better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. It should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is an aspect of the script. None of the characters has ever admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. Nor his mother, played by Keaton. At one point he broke a promise he made to a character to not reveal that he was sleeping around. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the film has a "political program". This is a puzzling thing to say. There was no policy in this film.
