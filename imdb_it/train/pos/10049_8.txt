I am not a parent, nor am I a male. But I was able to identify with the suffering and pain of every character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teenagers should watch. Perhaps this way they will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. I am sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it's nice to see Ben Affleck, 19, giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age that he is capable of a sincere drama. More serious roles should be offered. Note Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in years and came out and won the best actor at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Maybe they shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might be afraid that the same could happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched with friends many times. Because it portrays the values ​​that are important in life.
