What a beautiful television movie that warms the heart. The story tells of a five-year-old girl who lost her father and finds it impossible to make it. Even his mother is very distressed ... only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness. What all the spectators hope will materialize. Samantha Mathis is as brilliant as the baby's mother, as she was the nurse of "Jack and Sarah", it's worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and her friends; year tears torn film! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a delightful grandmother in this tender and beautifully acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (five years old) is charming and a very convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so moving. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness that is clearly illustrated and clearly it is still all around us in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" gives us all hope, realizing that there are many lovely people in the world with so much love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
