With all the "Adult" allusions in today's family movies it's nice to see one where you don't have to worry about it and you can just sit and enjoy a family with your kids. Yes, this movie could have some bad words (there is that time when Knox swears, but they don't let you hear the complete words), but for the most part this movie is really as clean as them (and this includes films from the past). Not only that, it's a lot of fun, one of my favorites, and just a clean and fun movie to watch with the family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it's too short and I wish there were more memorable parts in there, I won't mention them because I don't want any spoilers here. <br /> <br /> All in all well done and a great movie to watch; so get out and get the kids, make cookies and watch this movie!
