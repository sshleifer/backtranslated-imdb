What begins as a generational conflict in this film ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. The film winds through Europe with the father and young son in a car over 3000 miles. Cramps impose lifestyle, beliefs and life skills to clash. There is really no clear winner. All in all in the end as an experience, experience of multiple levels of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle vision, without being intrusive on the agenda. It is a story of formation for the young son, his contemptuous and rebellious nature turns into an opening to receive more ways of life.
