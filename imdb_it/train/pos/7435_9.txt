I saw this video for the first time 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent then and I still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge values ​​a lot with me. Anything that could detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of history would not get my vote of excellence. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation grown up on television. Furthermore, Michael Redgrave's voice adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it. Ok, so there wasn't a big budget for the project. So it wasn't Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can reject Gustave Doré's illustrations as part of the presentation? The comment above, which in just four lines rejects the video as a piece of junk, is grossly unfair and unconvincing. I'm a friend of the producer, but this is not my reason for this comment. Rather, I am defending a work of art that I think has value at all levels. He is apt to bring Coleridge's poetry to students in a way that awakens their appreciation and awakens their sympathy for the lesson given by the ancient sailor.
