Oh, this is such a glorious musical. There is a bit of a hindrance: Frank Sinatra is a terrible mixture like the Jew Nathan Detroit, although it becomes evident only on "Sue Me", which is a decidedly Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the show's best songs, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with a lower Sinatra piece. With these two flaws in mind, the film is still magnificent. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can't sing beans worthy, but he still pulls it away. Stubby Kaye wonderfully resumes his role on Broadway (it was written for him). Damon Runyon's language, rhythm and humor are quite good. This is in my "I see-all-the-possibilities-I-get" list.
