I saw "Fever Pitch" by chance; he was playing on the plane that was going to Europe. It really wasn't bad bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's number one fan of the Red Sox, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) may be tiring him. The film is a pretty interesting look at how world events can influence people's relationships. It is particularly evident that the Red Sox have now finished their series of defeats of 80 odd years. I guess this kind of thing happens all the time and we don't tend to notice it. Not too bad. <br /> <br /> Another film that portrays an unusual relationship with baseball is the "Frequency" of 2000. Check them both.
