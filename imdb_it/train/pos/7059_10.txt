I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web, I thought that Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very nice and fun sequel for everyone - kids and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find it and a very informative film, showing lessons on how to be true to yourself and follow your heart. I thought he had great animation, and the voice casting was very good; also the songs performed by Brooke Allison. Since this film was divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite among the three, is the story of when Jaq the mouse, he became a human for a day, thanks to the Fairy Godmother and his magic.
