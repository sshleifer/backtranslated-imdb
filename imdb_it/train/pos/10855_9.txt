Going back over the last 28 years (from my first exposure to the show), all I can say is: once you understand it, it will stay with you forever. I remember that my initial reaction was: 1) annoyingly outdated, 2) underproducts 3) unlikely characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later I watched some episodes again and didn't find it almost annoying. A year later I was able to capture the entire series from the beginning and quickly became absorbed in his bittersweet tale of human guilt and happiness prospects. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the dated production value would be difficult to handle now. But, I keep thinking about the show at least once a month with a vague desire for tears for what seemed to be simpler times ... <br /> <br /> BTW I am a married man ... (for all those who they think this is a show for females)
