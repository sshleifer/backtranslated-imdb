'Soapdish' is one of the best but least remembered comedies of the 90s. The film revolves around the various off-stage dramatic films that take place behind the scenes of a low-cost Daytime Soap Opera. The first of the film's strengths is the fantastic A-List cast. 'Soapdish' presents some of the greatest actors and actresses of his era. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly guided by Sally Field, like the aged neurotic actress Celeste Talbert (she celebrates fame when she is put in costume this makes her look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). His supporting cast reads like a who's-who of the great cinema greats of the 90s! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy greatly elevate the film. Goldberg is predictably excellent, while performances by Downey Jr. and Hatcher suggest the comic excellence that they would later achieve. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, the film is exceptional. There is a really modern aspect to the script, which goes off wonderfully bizarre on several occasions. There are also several visual gags that are rather ahead of their time. In a sense, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best and often recalled this review of "High Anxiety" (1977). Much of the film's humor is based on it, often quite biting, but rather accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, the extras casting session with Carrie Fisher's exploitative executive is both exhilarating and honest. <br /> <br /> "Soapdish" is, for my money, one of the best Hollywood comedies produced in the 90s. It's an excellent script and the class A cast makes it a must see. It's hard not to love this movie after it made you laugh for 90 minutes.
