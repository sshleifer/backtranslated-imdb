This was one of the funniest and biggest sitcoms to hit national television. It is unfortunate that the show is not placed among big sitcoms in which it really belongs. The actors did a great job and the seasons from one to six were the show at its peak. Although the seventh season was not so great compared to the previous six, it was still fun. Season 8 was the real problem. Without the grace of Topher or Ashton Kutcher the show simply collapsed. Don't say too much, the other actors weren't great if any of the two main characters had left as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (also Don Starks and Tommy Chong are great). show that it would have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) didn't help because he wasn't well received by show fans. I believe that if the show ended a year ago it would surely go down in history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the finish was excellent. I will miss the show, I just hope to wake up one day to find out that the show is back like the 80's with the same cast, because I will miss it a lot.
