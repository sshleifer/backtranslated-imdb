I swear when I saw this movie for the first time, I shouted out loud! A STAR IS BORN is the film that lets you know what love is, despite the obstacles of John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience what it means to lose a love like this at the end of the film. Streisand and Kristofferson have a great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With an extra look / Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This film made the song Evergreen one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also love the fashion of the 70s (except for the Afro from Streisand, besides being a beauty). A Star is Born is my favorite movie number one. This film is a pleasure to watch and is a puzzle at the end.
