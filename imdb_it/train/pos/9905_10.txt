I lost count of how many reviews I wrote on Slaughter High. I've read a lot of bad stuff and right now I'll say this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time due to his well-known suicide, and although this was his only film, it is what made the film so exceptional. At first I didn't know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I discovered because of the current web page at www.IMDb.com it was born in 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life certainly has its strengths and weaknesses. He did a good job of acting, who can disagree? I always wondered how he felt naked in a movie. It must have been rather embarrassing to say the least. I saw this film for the first time when I was 12 in the sixth year. I agree with some indications that the girl does not take a bath after someone has been killed, and that high schools do NOT have bathtubs! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time, was the only other star with a decent talent as an actor, and unfortunately for Simon's death he didn't make future films. The reason (s) for his suicide is a mystery, and we hope it will be discovered in the near future. Doing the math on his web page tells you he was 29 when he did Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs up, the best horror movie made. Probably because of their horrible acting, others have not become famous in the world of cinema. - Jacob Young
