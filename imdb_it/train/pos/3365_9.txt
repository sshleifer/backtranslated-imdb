A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Occasionally you happen to come across a film that really touches your nerves. This offers a very simple premise, almost perfectly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It is surprising that "Una giorni particulate" by Ettore Scola is relatively simple, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls him "junk" and Leonard Maltin, a little milder, "pleasant but insignificant". I disagree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but in its simple history it shows us more insights into everyday life in Fascist Italy than most of the films I've seen. The cinematography is clearly blurred, even a little bland, and the simple plot, which could explain the relative unpopularity of the film. Considering the late 1970s, the public wasn't exactly spoiled by great Italian films, it's even stranger that this hasn't really caught on with critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a collage of ten minutes of archive footage from Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. In this context, we meet Antonietta (Loren), a housewife, for the first time solitary and loving with six children in a Roman condominium. One day, when his Beo escapes, he meets his neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building who does not attend ceremonies. He is polite, cultured and soon attracted to him. Throughout the film, we hear the fascist gathering from the doorman radio shouting across the yard. Scola jokingly uses the camera to make us part of the process. After the opening scene, the camera crosses the courtyard of the modernist condominium (at that time hypermodern), apparently in search of our main characters, whom we have not yet met. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two main roles, all the more astonishing since they are expressed completely against the type. The Canadian John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but it is only on screen in the first and last scene. I imagine his voice should be nicknamed, since he is not of Italian descent and has never lived there, as far as I know, so I can't imagine him speaking Italian. If his voice was dubbed, I didn't notice it at all. On the contrary, it is completely credible as an Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The plot is simple but extremely effective, the performances are exceptional, the finish is simply perfect and the shot is not too pretentious but works completely. Don't miss this. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
