I grew up watching Full House as a child. I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started looking at it again. Now my children watch the show and they too love to see it. My kids can't believe that DJs on the show, and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I love the show, because it's a show you can watch with your family. It has good teachings that your children can learn from. Furthermore there are no drugs and violence on it. Also, when children have a problem on the show, they can always ask their family for help. This is the message that kids should receive from TV now one day, contact your family for help, not drugs. Children should watch more shows like Full House instead of half the casino on TV now. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it's down to earth. Talk about real life problems and family issues. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I rate the show at 10.
