Life Pod is one of those movies that you watch and try not to analyze too much. Acting is rather amateurish at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The plot is rather standard, but with an interesting twist. The computer has problems, but it is not exactly a computer and the situation is very understandable when the truth is revealed. However the film has its moments and is quite watchable. For me, at least part of the charm of this film is the leading role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is pretty enough. In all Life Pods it is very similar to other low budget science fiction films of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> The White Star Lines bit is nice, if completely inaccurate. The last of the shares of the White Star Lines Company was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947 and the last ship to sail under the colors of White Star was the Britannic (not the sister of the Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
