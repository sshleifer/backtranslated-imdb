I am black American and I love this soap opera. I saw him dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo, about 5-7 years ago. The story was a REAL story about a black slave who has a love affair with a white commander who led to his leadership and his candid and extravagant lifestyle. Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. He took what he had, nothing and saw his possibilities. Many say he sold himself - but he was trying to secure his future and that of his future children. <br /> <br /> It was such an excellent soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD but not released. This soap opera was the best soap opera NEVER. We need it released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. He is currently playing on Azteca America, which is available only in Mexico or the United States via pay cable. We need it, released again in Telemundo.
