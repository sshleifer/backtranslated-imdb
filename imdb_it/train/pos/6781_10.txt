When an actor has to play the role of an actor, of fantasy or fact, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He put all his talent and sincerity into that character. Facial expressions, mannerisms, gait and position spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also made an excellent Shakespearean actor in those short scenes like Othello that were part of this movie gem. Closures of Coleman's face as Otello tortured by doubts about Desdemona's loyalty were in themselves scenes worth seeing. Furthermore, the desperation outside the stage of his character can only reach someone with the depth of Coleman's acting perception. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this dual role was much deeper and more touching. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added her talent to the film. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film, especially the others he played and won the Best Actor Oscar in 1947. I would see this film repeatedly and it will never bore me.
