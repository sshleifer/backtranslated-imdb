We must remember that the 1950s were practically an empty board when it came to films. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, noir, two reelers, etc. A film with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. Some may think it was an improvement. I do not. Who was the tycoon who said: if you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less fun than some kind of distance therapy. <br /> <br /> This is a pip. These are three sisters trying to wrest control of their late father's property. One of them, perhaps the only one who is worth redemption, enlists the help of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay. At first he is in for the money, but in the end he falls in love with her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family plans to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable Get a little of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between sisters A little masochism. Hereditary madness - if there's such a thing. We never meet parents, but they must have been really ruined. The cast is virtually unknown. One or two actors sound vaguely familiar. Acting is so bad that it's hard to believe. It was released under the umbrella of artists united by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was filmed in and around LA especially at night and probably without permission. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they had run out of money and the producer decided to wrap it in the middle of a scene. <br /> <br /> I can't explain it - not even to myself - but I gave this pile of trash an 8/10. I am familiar with the term "It is so ugly it is beautiful", but I don't think I've ever met the phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rod to Hell", but this definitely fits. You could try this if you love movies that look like they're made in someone's basement.
