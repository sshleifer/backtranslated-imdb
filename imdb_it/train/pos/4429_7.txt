Personally, I thought the film was pretty good, very nice acting by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer. I can't really say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much, and overall I thought the film was too long. In addition to this, however, the film contained beautiful acting fights and many of the locations were beautifully filmed, great effects and lots of sword games. Another solid effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I really can't say any more about the movie, but if you only have a vision of Asian cinema, it's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I would suggest you try to rent it, but if you're a dead Hard fan of Asian cinema I'd say this must be a great Japanese film in your collection.
