I think the Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever as if it wasn't the best of the three Lion King movies! In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they come from and they have problems adapting to others like Timon who has difficulty digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa set off to find their dream place and find it and soon they find it and even Simba they raise but soon they have to choose between their dream place or help Simba face his evil Uncle Scar and proclaim his right as King Pride Rock Lion! Full of new wonderful characters like Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funny and he was dubbed by a comedian Jerry Stiller, Ben Stiller's father. Disney was smart in the role of Stiller in that role! Full of wonderful characters, animations, stories and music, Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of every sequel and best of Simba's Pride, although I'll admit that I loved that too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel for the whole family! It has a nice story and it's a lot of fun! 10 out of 10!
