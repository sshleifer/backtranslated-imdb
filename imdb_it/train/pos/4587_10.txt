Although Boiled by John Woo is Boiled, it's my favorite movie number 1. But I have to say that the police story is my favorite movie number 2. I say this because the stunts, fights and action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the balustrade on top of the helicopter that the mall grabs onto a pole surrounded by Chrismas lights and slides the fallen pole down through a skylight and finally land on the back on the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy it on amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in $ 14.) VHS new home video line. Any questions or comments do not hesitate to reply. (I am only 14 years old but I know where you can find any film ever made.) If you are looking for a film anywhere and cannot find it, answer me. Thank you and good night!
