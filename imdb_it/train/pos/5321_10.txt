This film really surprised me. At first I had doubts, but the film was always better for every minute. <br /> <br /> It is not for the public in search of action, but for those who love an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. If you are not fond of swearing or sexual content this is not for you. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty hard to follow sometimes, but in the end I think it made it better. The ending was unexpected since you were almost embarrassed to think it would end otherwise. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think it was good. It will not remain an Oscar for a long time, but at least it has caught my attention. The portrait of Gil Bellows of a prisoner is not always perfect but it is very funny. The portrait of Shaun Parkes of Bellows' fellow prisoner, Clinique, is large and extremely powerful. On the flip side of the coin I think I will put Esai Morales portrait of Markie. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and watch this movie, or you will either love it or not like it!
