This is a gem, a true piece of Americana for all that this implies. If you are self programmed to resist the stories of "unstoppable life", simply stay away and leave the pleasure to all those who still believe. And what makes the icing on the cake really enjoyable is that it is based on a true story of rags and riches, there is no need to choose precisely which details have been changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, in conflict with each other and with the father he played could be successfully completed by someone with his abilities and insights. The simple and mental comments, which refuse to accept a father who tries to depose the law all the time sensing that he could be off track, expose the commentator's limitation, not writers or acting. This is not for the cynical, or the simple mentality.
