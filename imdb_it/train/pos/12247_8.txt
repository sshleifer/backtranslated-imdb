I really loved this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was as fantastic as Emma and her fort was very good as a rider. the only complaint I had was about Mr. Woodhouse ... I can't believe a man can whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life ... she was a clever girl in the end though. as always, I love the places where these Jane Austin movies were shot. the settings are so spectacular. makes me want to visit England as much as Ireland and Scotland), I think the actors chosen for this film were a good choice and all the other narrative lines are intertwined with the best of Emma! I'm glad I saw that too.
