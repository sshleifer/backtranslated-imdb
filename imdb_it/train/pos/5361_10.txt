If you grew up on a diet of gameshows you will understand that gradually you need a bigger and better solution. Well, in the world of Running Man, your needs will be met. Because in this game prisoners compete for freedom and the ultimate prize - their own lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody in the tripe that numbs the mind we look at every day. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it's a great film. The basic idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very credible, and is very well represented in this film. Obviously there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite is when he's about to be catapulted into the gaming area, the gameshow host asks "Any last words?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back" but the host jumps "Only in a re-run" and presses the eject button. I give this film a 10 out of pure originality. I must have seen it 30 or more times. The only movie apart from the Die Hard series that I often watched this way !! <br /> <br /> In short, don't think for a minute that you have the T.V. - He owns you .....
