I just want to say that I'm so happy that someone finally spilled the beans in this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This film is a ridiculous farce of cinema. Especially for a student movie! I just want to give credit to Brush for taking the absurd amount of time of a cure to find such a rare image, and then TO COMMENT ON IT! Most people I know don't have that kind of time, especially so few will end up reading it. Congratulations to you ladies! However, the film follows a subtle plot that is at least incredible and simply silly. I understand the idea behind the creation of a Charlie's Angels satire, but why hire such atrocious actresses! Moreover, what kind of director has he himself acting, writing, producing and even modifying the image! Choose a job and put all your love into it! It's a shame because I heard he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Once again, thanks to Spazz to pull back the curtain of this film, people like you are a rare discovery.
