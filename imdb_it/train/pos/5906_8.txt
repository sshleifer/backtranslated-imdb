Doghi is a wonderful film and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So is Uttara Baokar which is usually excellent in most of its roles. Together with Kairee, he is an example of the Marathi cinema at its best. There are some parts to both teaching films - probably it would have improved the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered. These scenes probably emerge from the filmmaker's political concerns but the film is realistic and moving enough to not need it. But apart from these little quibbles, it's a film that deserves to be seen more and one I highly recommend. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shines through.
