For what it is, this is a good film. I like both Johns -Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong performances. Love interest is OK, but this is more a movie of a boy than a good movie with a date. I love the Harleys and I hated to see them paint over the "14 hands of hand-polished paint" with the good old Army Army Drab. There is a small history lesson here where Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I don't know if the training was similar enough to this! The film has kept my interest all the way without slowing down, with good driving action sequences. I like to look at the demographics of the voting history - an 18-year-old man gave the film a 10 (a true bike enthusiast, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I gave it an 8. I don't weigh all the movies with the same scale. There are big budget movies, with great actors, that you expect to be good at, so when they fail they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak by comparison. So from me it gets a lower rating than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
