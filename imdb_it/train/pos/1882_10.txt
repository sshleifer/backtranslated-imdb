<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made. It's a return to the glitxy, romantic comedies of the 40s ... but with a modern twist. The script bursts with wit, charm, humor and tenderness, photography is breathtaking (New York has never been so beautiful), and of course there's the cast! Dudley Moore plays the performance of his career as a lovable, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also melancholy and real ... one of the best lines of the film is his moving "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets". The great Sir John Gielgud won a very deserved Oscar for his splendid interpretation of Hobson, the valet and keeper of Arthur. Even if he considered a "take the money and manage the role", he brings all the talent to the character experience and skill of a tragic expert and a clever comedian. The supporting cast is also out of the world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's brash grandmother to Stephen Elliott's mafia. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also extremely memorable and perfectly completes the film. The only real problem with the film is the unlucky following.
