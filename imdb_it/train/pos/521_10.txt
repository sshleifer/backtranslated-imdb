This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for centuries, especially for a war-based film (briefly). Basically it's a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it's just a coincidence if it's a real place. However, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was about to crash into a plane, talk to June (monkey planet Kim Hunter) before saving him and said he loved her. He was destined to die from jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he is seeing and loving June in the flesh. This other place, like a paradise, is unhappy because it survived and was destined to come into their world, so they send the French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests that he should appeal to keep his life in the other world, he is allowed. Obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, June even offers to take its place! He also played Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as An Angel, a short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as An English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as The Judge / The Surgeon. David Niven was number 36 of the 50 Greatest British Actors, the movie number 86 of the 100 Greatest Tearjerker for happy ending, was number 47 of the 100 Greatest War Films, was number 46 of the 50 Greatest British Films, and was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Films. Awesome!
