Unusual and rather amusing sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are not only the so-called "antipasti" (think of Stephen King in a book of the same name), but also forever in contrast with each other about a woman who has a rather unpleasant habit of being an arsonist! The good special effects (especially towards the end), the extravagant performances of a talented trio of actors and surmounted by a really interesting and strangely appropriate soundtrack finally make "Wilder Napalm" a unique pleasure of a movie to watch ... if you can to find this is it! On a personal note, I was lucky enough to snatch it (so to speak) from the two-dollar bin at my local video rental store. (*** outside *****)
