The premise is simple. This film starts as your typical movie about two attractive young people who meet at an airport, then things take a 180-degree turn ... I for one, I really don't like the kind of an absurd and disturbing romance which pollutes the average cinema. And it is my humble opinion that even Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (Sceam), face ... <br /> <br /> Following this logic, it is not surprising to find that Craven is sardonically taking his time to build a nauseating sweet story of 'addictive love', only to have an INCREDIBLE Cillian Murphy wreck that the entire sugar-covered dream world ... <br /> <br /> The purpose of his character Jackson Ripner ( Jack the Ripper, get it? Blades, right?) In this film is awesome, it goes from being absolutely fascinating to being a sickly nihilistic sick, which is an advantage in my book. As he proceeds to scare his victim (Jennifer Garner looks like Rachel McAdams, which I find rather boring by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner, through Cillian Murphy, hitting all the chick-free movies ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, I salute you. <br /> <br /> Best quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after beating Rachel McAdams' snot in the toilet bowl): "Thanks for the quickie !!!"
