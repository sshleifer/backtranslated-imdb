I love this show as it is full of adventure, love and intrigue. Well, sometimes love! It's nice to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very nice to see Dick Van Dyke in a television role since I only saw him in Mary Poppins. the mixture of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very captivating for the public. This is a show you have to watch!
