As I watched this movie, and started to see its characters develop, I could see that it would be an excellent image. When you get that feeling, and the movie really fills those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling during this movie. Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Junior played interesting and incredibly strong parts that were both worthy of the Oscars. The supporting cast was equally strong, creating a winning base for image growth. I can say without hesitation, seeing this film will not disappoint.
