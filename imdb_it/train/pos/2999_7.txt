There have been times when this movie seemed to be much more complicated than necessary, but I think it's part of its charm. Detective Philo Vance's power of observation seems larger than all the Eastern investigators of the time combined when it comes to the final assessment of how the murders were committed. The throwing of the dagger in the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, couldn't somebody just drop it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a joke at the beginning of the film about Archer Coe's psychological inability to kill himself - I had to think about it for a while. I wondered if there really was any scientific basis for that concept to be true, not having studied psychology myself. It seems logical, but then there is always the case that does not fit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I got a kick from the agitated coroner (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Dr. Star Trek McCoy a couple of times said "I'm a doctor, not a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and telling himself - 'I'll have to use that sooner or later'. <br /> <br /> Once the identity of the killer is revealed, it does not seem such a big surprise, but until then it really has to be guessed. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film didn't answer the central question posed by the title, and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's Ghillie dog?
