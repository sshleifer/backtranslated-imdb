Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver, a tormented young man horribly abused by a monstrous, abusive, alcoholic stepfather, stepfather Barry (a really scary portrait of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate boyfriend (softly played by the adorable Tracee Newberry) and a job that transcribes autopsy reports in a local morgue. Frightened by his squalid past, pushed by the bald, radiating Jack the demon (a real creepy Michael Robert Brandon), and sent beyond the end of his mother's recent death, Eric freaks out and embarks on a brutal spree murder . Practically directed by Kallio (who also wrote the careful and acute script), with a uniformly fine acting from a cast without sound (Jeff Steiger is particularly good as the very useful guardian angel of Michael, Michael), a rather rough cinematography, but overall polished by George Lieber, credible and realistic characters, bursts of raw, shocking and fiercely ferocious violence, a soundtrack and ghostly by Dan Kolton, an uncompromising ending, grungy places in Detroit, Michigan, a darkly serious tone and a tense tone A compelling narrative that remains on a constant track throughout, this extremely powerful and gritty psychological horror thriller makes the vision often compelling and disturbing. A real sleeper.
