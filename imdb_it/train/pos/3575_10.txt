Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their role with such credibility, I just cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed her that she wanted to face the situation, but she was under her husband's rule. "Let him think about what he did," said the character of Robert Duvall, Joe, firmly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy", which means he was so upset and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end, when the character of Jason Presson, Arnold, revealed everything to a stranger, I was so heartened for him that I actually thought of some of the terrible things I did in my life. I customized and identified with his character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs did NOT add much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played the antagonist and feminizing brother of Ruth, Andy, like an idiot who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, behaved like a madwoman who beats Arnold in frustration over his problems without mercy and blaming him for his problems. I couldn't really feel sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep his marriage together, he was unsuccessful. Both did not address their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the movie and they were totally ridiculous. The minor role of Wilfred Brimley as a grandfather was, touching because he was the only character who showed Arnold any attention. I felt that his role should have been worked out. The players were simply doing what they considered adequate and sufficient. However, I liked the ending so much, actually I smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were again a family. Actually, I wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
