Lillian Hellman, one of the most famous writers of American women, was a woman with a mission. His leftist views were not well considered at the time in the country. In his memoir, he recounts his journey to the then Soviet Union, as he was intrigued by the so-called successes achieved by that system. "Watch on the Rhine" must be the result of those years. The left wing in America, as in the whole world has had a problem with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe, but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" was a game produced on Broadway eight months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In it Mrs. Hellman announced America's entry into World War II. The adaptation is credited to Ms. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, his longtime companion. As directed for the screen by Herman Shumlin, the film was well received when it was first presented in 1943. <br /> <br /> We were introduced to the Muller family when the film opens. They are crossing the US border from Mexico. They must continue to Ms. Muller's home in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a small celebrity guest. The Mullers, we realize that they are fleeing Europe because of the persecution there against opponents of the totalitarian regime that is advancing in Germany. In fact, we thought, in a sense, that the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jews, fleeing a certain extermination. <br /> <br /> We discover that Mr. Muller spent a bad time in his native land, as well as in other places because his frankness in denouncing Fascim. He does not know that he is coming to the home of his mother-in-law who is home to one of the worst exponents of that philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film offers excellent acting all around. It is a curious piece due to the supporting role of Bette Davis. Paul Lukas, repeating his role on Broadway, is quite convincing as Kurt Muller, the honest man who wants to create a better world for himself and his family. Lukas does a great job playing Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway. <br /> <br /> The other best performance is Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancovis, guest of the Farrellys, married to the despised Teck de Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good interpretations led by Mr. Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should serve as a reminder of the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.
