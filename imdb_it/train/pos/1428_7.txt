There are some spectacular photographs, which stop the heart here, in a series of landscapes and animals, from the arctic to the tropical and all the rest. The camera techniques are varied and start from close-ups to aerial work. The editing is terrible and even the comment is well chosen, with the right tone and some dramatic and revealing facts about our world. Where the film falls a bit is in an attempt to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and hunter / hunted interactions in multiple environments. In the end everything becomes a bit bizarre and disjointed. Overall, it's worth seeing especially considering the problems dealt with, but don't expect Oscar material.
