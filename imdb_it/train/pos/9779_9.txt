Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home but have changed in some way. In the first story our former cult member is now in an asylum and is visited by a journalist who wants to find out what happened to the cult. Slightly slow as the story is told in flashbacks as the two sit in chairs and face each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what led to the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising turn in history. Things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> The second story has a young violent criminal visiting a psychiatrist for a mandatory therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again, things slow down a little and get weird. Then there is a strange twist in history that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> The final story is about a spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove people's illness from their own hands. One of the patients is a former member of the cult, so successful healing becomes more complicated. Once again, we are surprised by a breakthrough. There's a pretty bloody scene in there. <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful full frontal nudity and a full masculine frontal nudity for some reason. I found the stories very well written and the director completely manages to create every story with his amazing touch and the dire consequences. <br /> <br /> Note: review of the German DVD.
