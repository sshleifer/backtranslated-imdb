Yes, Be My Love was the fame of Mario Lanza and is still popular today. His voice was strong and constant, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought it was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading Kostelanitz's book that he wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and vocal lessons have become the visionary Caruso di Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza has done a great job in history, but the story is not completely true; blame Hollywood! I used to practice singing his songs years ago, and I got pretty good until I lost my voice due to emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
