While the glittering chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is reason enough to see this film, the supporting cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is an added advantage. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as a clinical boyfriend of Ryan, and Shalub's line on Einstein's gonads is, as has been noted, one of the highlights of the film. The speech that Robbins gives to his first public appearance is pure poetry. Congratulations to the writers for handling this foam with wit and lightness. I also thought that Keene Curtis was as wonderful as Eisenhower. This could be considered something of a chick movie, but I think everyone will get a kick. Eight very solid points.
