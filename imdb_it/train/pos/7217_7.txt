Scene adaptations often have a major flaw. They often come out as if a camera were simply put on stage (like "Night Mother"). The director of Sidney Lumet keeps the film alive, which is particularly difficult since the film did not offer him a real challenge. Still, it's nice to look for what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship are surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve has one of his few chances to really act. I confess I never saw Ira Levin's work, but I heard that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is incredibly complicated and makes you think. "Deathtrap" is an extremely funny film and is recommended for almost all fans of stages and screens. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
