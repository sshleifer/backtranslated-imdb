"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far I've seen this movie three times in theaters and I'm looking forward to buying it on DVD this coming September. I read the book after seeing the film and was amazed by the similarity between the book and the film. The director of this film did a great job in recreating the book in cinematic form. Furthermore, all the actors selected to play the roles were wonderful when they played their characters, particularly Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props to all those involved in the making of this film, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I highly recommend it to everyone!
