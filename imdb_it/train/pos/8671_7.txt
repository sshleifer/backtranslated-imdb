Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Brand Smackdown. <br /> <br /> Match Results Next ******** <br /> <br /> We are starting the show with The Inferno game. Kane v. MVP. This was a good match. Nothing about wrestling here. This was about graphics. Overall, this was not bad. There were a few tight spots here with Kane getting too close to the fire, but in the end, Kane won with the ram with the MVPs in the fire. <br /> <br /> Beautiful opening. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new tag team game: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match two: Fatal four way ladder match. This was a total carnage. Judging by three of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. The stains were incredible. A total spot-fest. A point where Jeff went to Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff reached the ladder! Shortly thereafter, Jeff is on the highest rope with two ladders nearby, while MNM is about to kill Jeff, Matt takes the shot and Jeff hits Joey Mercury's "swing" shot! Mercury is injured. His eye closes quickly and is tossed openly. Mercury is eliminated from the game and Nitro is still there. He's going to fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grab London and tame it face to face on the scale! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot, throws the dropkicks through the ladder to nail Jeff! Awesome! In the end, London and Kendrick keep the tag team titles. What a match !!! <br /> <br /> This was crazy. I can't understand why WWE hasn't announced this until now. The Buirato would increase enormously. I'm sure the replay value will still be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered a broken nose and lacerations to the eye. He's in the hospital now. Take good little boy. <br /> <br /> In no way, here we are. <br /> <br /> Next up: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) This was a game of nothing. Will the Boogeymen ever fight? Even the MIZ sucks. After a crazy crowd, this kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong game. I liked it. Chavo hit a super-complex murderer at one point! Benoit has also hit Eight Germans! Benoit wins with the sniper. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Yang-cruiserweight championship title. This was a good game. Unfortunately, the stupid fans didn't care about this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and fighting well. I agree with JBL. He made revelry to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or go out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a snail festival, with few exceptions. Kennedy at one point threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The final point was Kennedy with his stoned Taker tombstone on the hearse and won the game. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. Both work hard. Still, Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should have lost. Creativity is ruined again. <br /> <br /> A stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not this one. At least Torrie wasn't here. It's refreshing. Judging from the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your bathroom break. Next one. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a null match. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker cannot work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The ending went wrong. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair and Batista didn't sell the shot and ended the match. Boring. Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder coincided with the main event here. There was enough money that was right there. Some others were solid. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A good PPV with the matching scale that is the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show, it is not convincing enough. Smackdown must stop letting Tag go. Leave Smackdown standing on their two legs. This show shows that Smackdown can do it.
