I just realized I've been using IMDb for years and I've never reviewed my favorite movie. As a favorite, I do not mean something I like for now, I want to say that this film is so perfectly supernatural that there will never be another animated experience that touches it. This is obvious because I will never be a child again; I saw this movie on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12, the age group to which this film is directed, I am also male, the genre this film is destined for (the vast majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are women). Consequently this film has indelibly inspired my child psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) For producing the English dubbing of this film that is far superior to the Diy ney production which is not even funny - not I've never been able to see it - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately, however, Macek's version is so good (the voices almost exactly matching the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It is not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent reviews, so I'm going to put some curiosity here, not that I'm the definitive information archive for this film. <br /> <br /> First of all I would like to agree with the review that stated that 20 out of 10 are needed to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they almost make the entire "IMDb catalog" disappear. "in insignificant. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this film is that Miyazaki based the campaign around the Slag's Ravine (city area of ​​Pazu) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 1980s (it may be the late 1970s) immediately after one of the major mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of socialist student movements in the 1960s he felt their condition. The struggle between citizens and pirates initially serves to illustrate this empathy with the worker. The countryside and the clouds, especially in this film, remind me of where I grew up while his film depicts a fantastic version of the rolling hills of the mid-west British Isles. <br /> <br /> The island is obviously the satirical genius of the Swift novel of the eighteenth century - the story of Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves myths like Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture is also based on Peruvian ruins, although I'm not sure, someone told me. <br /> <br /> Anyone returning to read this review and those interested in this film will REALLY want to take a look at the epic Miyazaki Mirai Shounen Conan series - Future Boy Conan - based on the short science fiction novel "The Incredible Tide "by Alexander Key (the novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. Also, you may not be familiar with his previous works for Masterpiece Theater, some of his main animations. He also made the key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the best wallpapers I've ever seen. See also the first feature film by Miyazaki and Takahata, Horus Prince of the Sun (1968), surprising by today's standards. What else ... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - although they are quite rare. <br /> <br /> This film is such a gift, I don't know what we would do without it with all this other shit story around, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
