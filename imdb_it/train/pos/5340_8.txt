Clara Lago is wonderful as the protagonist of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl who moves to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother returns home to die and is left with her grandfather. He also makes friends and experiences very quickly. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is initially a nuisance to her, then they come closer. The film is shot beautifully, above all filled with soft colors. Carol aspires to her father, who is a pilot at war, and you can feel the love he has for him. While the war itself is a bit like a back seat in this film, it wraps up the character's lives. I think you'll like it. Look at it above all for Clara Lago, who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch.
