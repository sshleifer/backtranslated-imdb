This is one of those movies for which they have made too much promotion. If you look at T.V., then you might not even watch the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one that seems to be Jennifer Annisten the funny. It's typical Jim Carrey humor and it's really fun. Just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a must see, otherwise watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied.
