humorous. funny. intelligent. awesome. I was flipping through channels one night ago years ago. he came across this and started a fire. I was up late every night and recording for everyone I know. some. like 3 people out of almost 100 people I did watch this I didn't think it was as great as I did. the others were laughing so loudly that they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor do not walk. watch this and have fun. intelligence and humor. it is a win-win situation for everyone. I wish I could have afternoon tea with him and meet the really rare comedian that we, as a society, need more than ... sanechao.
