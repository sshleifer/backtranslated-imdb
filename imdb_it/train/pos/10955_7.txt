I originally marked Sarah's show with a rather fat 8, but I struggled a little with her humor recently and a slender 7 is what's set. I'll explain it. <br /> <br /> We both like Sarah's humor or you won't. If you don't, I doubt anyone could persuade you. You guys know who you are and all is well, but you know it too. Going forward, the first season gave us fantastic things about Sarah, her friends and family, and her activities in life. In a memorable episode, she is "dragged" by the officer Jay she meets for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm here?" he asks. "Why do you have all the C's in high school?" she answers questioningly. It seemed to be a genuine question. - They are fun things in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange angles. In another episode, his relationship with God was particularly amusing. God being petty and jealous he added wonderfully to the joke. He is intelligent, he is a distorted vision, but he would show us the truth in humor and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came season two. Although not yet without a new and inventive comedy, it seems that we have somehow slipped into trivial poo poo and fart simply. I have good laughs here and there, but a lot seems to be filling, while she and the writers are struggling to stir up the original material. Sophomoric and boring are the feelings I feel for the episodes lately, but I'm gutting it for the gems I find (the turtle) and I wait for her to turn it over. I was a fan of his "Jesus is Magic" routine and would like to think about understanding what he is capable of. Let's go back to that.
