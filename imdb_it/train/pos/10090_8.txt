I was prepared for a turgid talky and a travel diary, but I was happy to find a script with a fast pace, a fundamental morality, excellent representations of all the actors, in particular Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense and beautiful cinematography - c It is also a blow from the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor with her most glorious beauty and sympathy, before giving in to the mad hysterics that ruined her next job. All the support players complete the whole thing, and I wonder who trained all those elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the Buddha-stone sequence, you can really discern that it is Vivien Leigh in long shots. Its shape and the way it moves are different from those of Taylor. The only thing that ruins that sequence is the poorly made process shots, in which the background moves too fast for the horses to walk. <br /> <br /> If you want a stimulating film that is beautiful to look at and never boring, let's spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
