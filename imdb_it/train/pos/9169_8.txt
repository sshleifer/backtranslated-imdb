I really liked Timothy Dalton even though he was a little young and too good for Mr. R. but I thought Zelah Clarke was too plump and short. This version however was very faithful to the novel and very well shot. I saw 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr R, although George C Scott did very well and is a pitfall between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, even though they were both a little too old for the role. I recently saw a television version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I'd like to see those two Jane Eyre. When I saw the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think I'm out of Jane Eyred, but I'll never get tired of those first few minutes of listening to Joan Fontaine's voice that tells the opening of the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
