I know that movie snobs are snorting. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-movie jungle, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> A little thin at times, but his jokes and position more than compensate for it. John Hurt (God loves him), seems to have fun making his role as super white slave. Crawfords' nemesis, Jake Speed. It adds a dimension to the film that only a professional like Hurt could provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes' partner) are a good team, even if you wonder why they both tolerate each other. However, both Crawford and Christopher play a team that is so funny that if you can overcome yourself for a moment, you may find yourself acting like a kid again to the intrinsic situations and suspense they provide. The delightful Karen Kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress who is more worried about her savior's motives than her tormentor. <br /> <br /> I have yet to find a movie that is so much fun without being a preacher, or that bothers me in trying too hard. Not all films must be the last "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was an original. So, remember that sometimes movies are for fun. They are not social comments or attempt to politically influence an audience. But just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in an age where our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
