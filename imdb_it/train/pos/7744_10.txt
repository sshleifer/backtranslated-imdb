A must-see movie with great dialogues, great music, great acting and a superb atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In the film you will follow 8 people for a day in the city of Antwerp, they are all individuals and sometimes simple strange (that's how I love them!). <br /> <br /> I have no intention of saying anything else, go see and have fun.
