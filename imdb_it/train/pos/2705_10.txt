This is a script that Ed Wood has been working on for over 10 years trying to be realized. Aris Iliopulos finally had the nerve to film a script that Wood saved from his burning house at the expense of other more transient valuables. <br /> <br /> This is a film without dialogue, which some might call madly silent. In fact, it's a pretty noisy film, without the silly chatter of most movies. In the hands of these directors, the music and the sound effects offer a rich audio experience that works better than almost all the grist of the Hollywood script, in particular what was the last stupid Billy Zane ("Look!", " Oh no! '- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I will take Zane's wonderful monosyllabic cries in this film through empty dialogues every day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane leads a team of players that of course really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods shine when you put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy in the same poster. <br /> <br /> design is perfect, the exquisite pyramid set, and the bestial performance of Ron Perlman is simply wonderful.Overall, this is a chaotic and visceral masterpiece lovingly created by Ed Wood Jr. fans, author and film fan. who really love the threads m, as Iliopulos and his first-rate cast obviously do. A film to make you wish you had done it yourself.
