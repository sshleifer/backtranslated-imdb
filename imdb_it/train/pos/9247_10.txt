I expected this film to be a love story of 1930. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy recaptures her in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays with the artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and raising mischievous eyebrows. He hides from the cops when he breaks into Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow), to find her covered with bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant chemistry. Play hard for a while, but a girl can resist that sneer for so long. The heat between them is obvious, and there are some scenes that are definitely a pre-production code! When a job of blackmail goes wrong and Ruby ends up in a pension for "girls in difficulty", she is unhappy and, thanks to the ragged that her roommate gives her, she begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the hard-nosed Ruby, speaks fast perfectly. He never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is a particularly moving scene with his way of playing "their song" on the piano that behaves perfectly. The last fifteen minutes make me cry every time. A truly sweet love story.
