For me this is the most perfect movie of Ealing Studio - as new and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was published. <br /> <br /> Like a satire on the economic notions of "growth" and the commercial need for in-built obsolescence, it could hardly be more up to date. And what other film can you say that the hero literally wears the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely, there are parallels with Jurassic Park, in which to confuse the environment will literally turn you and bite you. But Spielberg avoided the brilliant central intuition of the book to deal with some nonsense about "children". Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In The Man In The White Suit, Alec Guiness plays a young idealistic scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out. Suddenly workers and capitals in the mill of the English north where he works are united as never before in the protection of their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing, it's a comedy, but it wasn't necessary. The complex intertwining of vested interests (should it be suitable?) Takes place magnificently, as all parties realize that "progress" is a threat, and that ingestability and waste are what makes the frames run. <br /> <br /> But yes, this is a comedy, even if a bit sharp, and among the political ironies there are delicious performances, and some good surprise laughs. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is the pungent satire that lasts - dazzling and white.
