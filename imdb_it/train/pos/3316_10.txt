Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her every time she's on stage. Whether we're laughing at his jokes and antics or taking our eyes off the tensions of one of his terrible ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see Bette), this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible his voice has changed and matured over the years, but he has never lost his power. His most "vocally correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, here it's just purer and more heartfelt than ever. I will treasure this concert for a long time.
