An absorbing analysis (even if repetitive and rather didactic) of exploitation and desperation in a situation in which there is no way to go on or up, where attempts to make you feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems be the only option. But even here, in this desolate desolate land of lost dreams and without a future, which does not work, and reaching something or someone with whom to comfort and share, a simple act of charity, it gives some reward, even if it only makes the present bearable by reviving the memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little violence on the screen, this is a tough and brutal film about the lack of oppression (politically and personally) that does not make entertainment easy. Clearly based on a theatrical work, with a small cast, a broader and more expansive relationship with the general social and political environment would probably have helped the film reach a wider audience.
