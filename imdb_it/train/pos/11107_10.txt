The sopranos (who are now preparing for the end) are the pinnacle of adult television and drama. When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark. Using great writing and great actors (most of whom are extra from Goodfellas) the series is loud to progress satisfactorily, unpredictably and exceptionally. Leading the cast is James Gandolfini, who for all intensive purposes is Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco, who certainly holds it. The series also boasts a large collection of regular customers to push the plot with any means necessary (usually violence and vulgar language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are great secondary characters that make each episode more interesting. Among the seasonal extras we remember names like Steve Buscemi (excellent!), Joe Pantoliano (great!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern mafia societies that, despite the rare bad stories, manages to be a unique TV. Symbolism and simple plots, dreams and shootings and many other things create intertwined stories and relationships that are resolved at the end of each season to create another perfect HBO package.
