Realized only ten years after the real events, and set in the Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film is absolutely compelling. It smells of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of the world war. I haven't seen this in over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave. Searing bit of dialogue between two generals: "Does God exist?" "If he did, we wouldn't do it." Too bad this is no longer readily available for the show or purchase because it would be interesting to see and compare this film with the documentary on Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (also known as "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall "with Bruno Ganz.
