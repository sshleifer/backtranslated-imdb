This is a "time odyssey" through computer animation, presumably the work of over 300 artists. Made in the late 1980s and published in 1990, this was avant-garde stuff for the day. I thought it was beautiful and quite interesting in commercials. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes made no sense, just shapes that evolved into other forms, but it was fun to watch. This is all about images, not really about any kind of story. There were some strange sequences in which strange-looking men-creatures would have danced around with the birds heard. All this is animated by the computer that was new then. Even the term "animated computer" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It is simply the possibility of showing this new technology in short parts of cartoony-like events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, only images with electronic music. The Stoners must have really loved it. <br /> <br /> I am a beautiful, intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy". With today's CG effects, this may have lost its impact, but I think you would still be entertained by this.
