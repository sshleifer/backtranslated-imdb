I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you can feel for. The young man returned from the service was still in love with the girl he had left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in the role of the romantic protagonist and Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her as if he were hungry for the sight of her and for his hesitation and confusion, even his feelings for him were interpreted very well. The rest of the store's eccentric characters were perfect as they tried to bring them together. However, the most moving scene was the young couple in his grandfather's house. I laughed in part, cried in some and loved watching this movie. In fact, I reviewed it about 5 times. A definite must see for the romantics in total.
