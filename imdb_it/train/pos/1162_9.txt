Like many people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I think it's great. But I didn't know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" velvety like the other despised woman. Good music, intrigue and a scene of death involving Amanda's revenge on an abusive Dr. who will stay with you for weeks. I'll leave it to this. Congratulations.
