I haven't seen the movie yet, but I can't wait to see it! It looks very interesting and challenging. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions it posed stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the "battle inside" ... thank god there's someone hitting another corner with the boxing thing. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is very hot. I particularly liked the short clip with the really smart movie actor Rocky. I thought the selected theme - overcoming adversity and childhood trauma - was timeless, and God knows that many people need it. Take it.
