This is one of those unfortunate films that have suffered an even more sad and unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film in a local art cinema, in revival form, shortly after being crowded by mainstream cinemas. It certainly deserves to be addressed a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. takes him to the limit by making words and taking some well-known songs in this piece (his version of Hank William "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" could easily make you cry). Perhaps one day the public will be ready to take this film a little more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughter). The film moves at a fast pace (thanks to a nice editing), so that some viewers don't find it stale and boring. Perhaps a revival has just finished the pipeline.
