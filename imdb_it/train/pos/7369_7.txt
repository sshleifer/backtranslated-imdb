Personally I couldn't get into "This is not a Love Song", it's a brilliant movie and there's a great storyline, I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much of the movie was left. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, where they close depends on each other to get along in life. At the same time, I wish the report was more than it is. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike Ibsen isn't in love with Heaton, or doesn't know how to love him. The acts of treason, on both sides, have a great effect on the two men. They are both devastated by the fact that the other escaped and abandoned them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
