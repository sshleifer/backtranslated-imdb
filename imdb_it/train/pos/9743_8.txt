We saw this film for the first time as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we didn't think it was extraordinary. Looking at it for the second time, we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film takes place on one of the darkest days in Argentina, while the DeLaRua administration was ending. The country was in turmoil after the economy, which had flourished in the early 1990s, under the climate artificially created by President Menen. It was a time when dollar bank accounts were frozen and people had a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired for the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving compassion from his wife, she closes him out of the apartment and he, for all practical purposes, becomes a homeless person. He goes down the street trying to make ends meet. <br /> <br /> The other story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew, who interviews for a job with a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle that you get the job. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of "El Once" in the city center. Things go from bad to worse when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela, the young woman in love with Ariel, comes to help father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, who is a clean man, has to resort to taking showers everywhere. He chooses a ladies room in one of the subway stations. When the orderly, Elsa, finds him naked, he becomes furious, but he comes to his senses when he realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They become romantically involved, and Santamarina finds one child on one of her trash journeys. Elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives that will cement their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who met the beautiful Laura at work, begins a turbulent and heavy sexual relationship with his beautiful worker, unknown to him, involved in a lesbian affair. Ariel, who frees the spears by photographing weddings and other occasions, feels a passion for Laura, but realizes what Estela sacrificed to help her father and still loves him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, of whom "El Abrazo Partido" we thought was excellent, I did miracles with this film. Things are put in the right perspective after a second viewing recently and we have to apologize for not having perceived it the first time. If ever, this second time, the nuances of the screen played by Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country lived in those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, collaborated with Mr. Burman before surprising results. It is not "a beautiful movie star", however, it is beautiful. This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another wonderful surprise. His Santamarina is disarming. Despite all the bad things that have fallen on him, he maintains a rosy attitude towards everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors, plays the small part of Simon. The splendid Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias" shows that Daniel Burman is a voice not to be underestimated in Argentine cinema.
