Contains * spoiler * - also, my quotes may not be exact. <br /> <br /> Everyone always takes note of satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true it is. But for me, I see this movie much more than this. I love the symbolism of this boy in a bright white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him, but it will not stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play it: his boyish smiles and his eternal curiosity are so appropriate: <br /> <br /> "It's brilliant - can you tell me, what's the relationship between ink and gasoline?" <Br /> <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention did not work after all - remaining there almost naked. Still, more than shame is the simple disappointment that "didn't work". It is never really intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we want to stop it too." <br /> <br /> Barely a moment's hesitation before leaving trying to escape again. Does it show any sign of the pain that such betrayal must have caused? No. <br /> <br /> The role of Dapne is also remarkable. She is sick and tired of money and power. He thinks he has finally found love, outside of his father's company. At first, she doesn't care about Sidney more than anyone else. But that moment when he falls out of his car and she comes back to see if maybe he killed him - yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention. Finally he found something worth living for. The funny thing is that it's not even a love story. It is friendship, but of such an ephemeral nature that the title hardly fits. It is more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. <br /> <br /> After discovering that Michael has no real love for her, and that his father is completely incompetent to care for her, he gives in to cynicism and tries to temper Sidney. Fortunately he discovers that there are indeed people in this world who live for more than power, money and lust. Refreshments: <br /> <br /> "Thanks Sidney, if I said" yes "I think I would have strangled you." <br /> <br /> I like it a lot, when all this crazy business seems to have ended in nothing. But then, the sparkling, bizarre beat starts and Sidney moves away, his gait matches the melody: fearless. Where is Daphne? We don't really know, but they weren't really in love and she wasn't really a scientist. She got help by running away and she got "a shot in the arm of hope". (Pollyanna) A continued relationship would have been nice, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I had hoped ..." <br /> <br />
