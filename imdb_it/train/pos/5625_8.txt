Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being approached by a lone motorcyclist. She is mortally shaken by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the aggressor makes his way to Marjorie's house and subjects her to humiliating terror. Bruised and bloody, Marjorie manages to take over her attacker, making the living lights of the idiot explode and making him impotent thanks to wasp splashes in his eyes and in his throat. Bonded and abused pig, Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they return home. There is almost a hint of pity, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should he continue to make his punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and approximate language make a rating R. Fawcett really moves away from the ditsy roles that would forever taint his career. Congratulations to director Robert M. Young.
