Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, her follow-up Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, son of Dana, and Step in Liquid (IMAX). I saw the first one, not the others. <br /> <br /> While the surf material is spectacular, I really enjoyed the filmmaker's historical perspective. It takes us back to the origins of sport almost a hundred years ago and shows how it evolved into its current form. This includes extensive interviews with prominent personalities and artists, how surfboard designs change over time, which Hawaiian and California beaches were most frequented by world-class surfers and what incredible adrenaline rush provided them. Athletes lived on the beaches for months at a time, sailed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary beds, fished for food, and returned to their tables the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest push for the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect that copyright issues may prevent you from crediting Beachboys surf songs like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. The Surfing magazine and the Surfing Encyclopedia (which knew there was such a tome) are cited for their contributions. We also see comments from the pioneers of sport, their families and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s. One of these stories is how forty-year-old Laird Hamilton, considered the greatest surfer of today, tied to a previous leading surfer, introduced him to his single mom, whom he married before becoming his stepfather. <br /> <br /> An engaging background music of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. Have I whetted my appetite? Wonderful. Have a good trip
