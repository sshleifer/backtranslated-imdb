"Kalifornia" is a good Hollywood odyssey of suspense and terror that tells of two couples who drive the country through California to share the cost of gas: a couple of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two artists, a photographer and a writer ( Duchovny and Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character who is at the center of this rather predictable thriller. A good watch for those in flix psycho-killer.
