This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought of the September 11 attacks. This film has been cleverly put together and presents this disaster as more than a US ground attack. The consequences of this disaster are foreseen by many different countries and perspectives. I believe this film should be more widely distributed for this point. It also helps the healing process to finally see something different from the news on the terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually fun, but not so abusive. This film was highly recommended to me and I convey the same feeling.
