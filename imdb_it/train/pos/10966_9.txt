Gray Gardens is a world apart. Edith and Little Edie live in almost total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in an improvised kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. The cats wander around while their mother Edith insults her daughter's proposal. This is a Tennessee Williams work that comes to life and should inspire scriptwriters and playwrights, as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation at home reminds me of exactly how my grandmother and her 50 -ish daughter lived for a decade (other than that they were poor and clean). They fought all day, her grandmother spoke of her gloriously perfect past while her daughter constantly blamed her for missed opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship like this. It's sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an amazing job of making the Edies feel comfortable enough to expose them so rashly. It is rare to see real life in this way and even more special considering the context: the remains of a powerful family that vanishes into the skeleton of their villa.
