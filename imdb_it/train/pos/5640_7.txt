I really think this film is great, personally. But in every movie there's a downer. Now, some of you may not have seen Hilary Duff's "Raise the Voice", but if you think about it, those two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In "Brave New Girl", Holly wants to get into Haverty Conservatory so much. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terri wants to go to a L.A. (I don't remember the name of the conservatory there). They are both in the field of music, and both must sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films are similar. Personally I prefer "Brave New Girl" better than "Raise Your Voice".
