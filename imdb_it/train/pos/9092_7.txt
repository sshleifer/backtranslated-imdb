I think this film enhances diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way it shows the various communities that leave together in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities are run by the king. The plots around the camp are, as usual, a struggle for power with a lot of betrayal. The wardrobe is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the elephants as performers is very interesting. It's funny and I think it's also usable in schools for its historical accuracy because it shows that Europeans in Asia were subjects of local kings very differently from the traditional perspective of Hollywood.
