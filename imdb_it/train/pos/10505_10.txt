Yes, it is true, it is. I firmly believe that the N64 and the odd-looking controller were both designed to make this game. It was fantastic the first time I saw it, with its huge rooms and colorful characters, and it's incredible now. The control of the game is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniable. A must have for every N64 owner, and a reason to get a N64 for everyone else.
