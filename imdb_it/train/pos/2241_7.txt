Another comedy about a small and unfortunate country struggling in the jungle of the modern world (for the forties) with only one native talent and trying to guide them, this is a nice entry into the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas shines as usual in the head, while a threatening ministry man has brought to the brink of disaster when a country that is allegedly charged with starting to attract world interest, Ian Bannen is a great romantic protagonist, inserts Peter Sellers one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and super-suave John Le Mesurier plays against the guy as a robust revolutionary leader. A lot of fun is had by everyone, especially the viewer; perhaps not in the higher end of the Ealing classics, but rather at the top.
