I started watching the show of the first season and at first I was quite skeptical about it. The original film was a bit childish, and I was just looking for a science fiction show while waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-like-think-he-is Jack O'Neill, the not-only-intelligent Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, favorite women and children and genius Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but above all it's not about technology or space combat: it's about helping your friend, even risking your life for he. This is "we don't leave anyone behind". Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all the good qualities that make human - Human. <br /> <br /> And now it's about breaking a record, going into season 10, and doing good again.
