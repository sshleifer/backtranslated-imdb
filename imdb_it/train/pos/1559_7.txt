This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode aired from the meeting. This is for many reasons. For example, bring the series back to some of its roots. He recognizes Lionel from a supposedly long absence, with his office in Luthorcorp Square in Metropolis. This room hasn't been in Smallville for a very long time, and seeing it again brings back many memories of Smallville's past. Not to mention, Lionels' conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another pleasant return is, well, you guessed it, it's Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only brings together the former Northern League justice agents, he mixes them with the Smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost seems like a feature film. <br /> <br /> From there you get basic history, Green Arrow forms the league, tries to blow up 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark saves it, and the structure is sent to the realm com. Everything is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, rhythm and suspense. Oh, and Cyborg has some fantastic new upgrades for the Justice League character :). <br /> <br /> Music is probably what makes this episode so good. If you remember right, the first episode directed by Steven Deknight was Agless of the fourth season. It was a mediocre episode, but something seemed out of place. maybe it was the music, or the acting, or the fact that clark sais in the end "we didn't find you, you found us", kind of people made lose faith in the formula. But luckily Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I had a bit of quilt on Justice that made it not up to the 10 complete. First of all, the rough approximation of the championship of justice is the expansion of the Ridge structure. I mean, it would have been much nicer if Green Arrow and Cyborg had taken off on Oliver's bicycle (remember the arrow episode). Clark and Impulse obviously had to run and Aquaman would have to swim through another route. But it was incredibly mischievous, he cashed 2 points from the top 10. <br /> <br /> Secondly, another bad moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow sais "let's go save the world" . This made me shudder. Overall, judging by recitations, music, direction and production values, the pros outweigh the disadvantages, and this is still one of the best episodes in the history of Smallville, and perhaps the second best episode of season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ...
