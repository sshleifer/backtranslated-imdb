I'm amazed at how this movie (and most of the others have an average of 5 stars and less when there are mediocre films from 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out almost everyone has it slammed. ex-girlfriend said this movie is questionable, years later I sat down to watch this movie and had fun, even laughing a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that have labeled the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay I don't see since when most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything that was invented by Michael Bay, anyway ... <br /> <br /> History: Alvin Sanders ( Jamie Foxx) is a former prisoner who is used by a treasury agent Edgar (David Morse) as a pawn to capture a murderer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson). Alvin every move is tracked down by an insect implanted in his jaw after an accident. is looking for the bricks of it ro that they were caught in a shot gone wrong. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is as fun and great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a talker who is much smarter than he suggests. Doug Hutchinson is as good as Bristol. He may be exaggerated at times in his demeanor John Malkovitchesque. He was better off here than he was like Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is as good as the hard-edged treasure agent. Mike Epps is also as fun as Alvin's brother, Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the film is that some of the thriller attempts fall horizontally. The hippodrome scenario is exaggerated, but I could not look away. The director went all out there, so he gets points for it. Also the scene of the bomb with the treasure officer tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was quite elegant. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bait is not a bad movie from a long shot. It's never boring, it's always fun and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. This should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated films of 2000. <br /> <br /> PS: for the reviewer who claimed that this film is too violent ... How long have you lived under a rock? I'm pretty sure you saw the series Die Hard and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But those films are not violent, are they? Weirdo.
