There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films of all time, not only of its kind but also outside. I love the eerie atmosphere of the movies as it could all happen in this kind of situation that is scary to think. Also imagine if you were ever in this situation what you would do. This is a film that I like to watch a lot, especially during Halloween. John Carpenter is a very professional director who loves many of his other films, but there is no doubt that his most famous film is the movie Halloween.Oh and if you think you won't attend the remake of Rob Zombie. It's pure shit and a real Halloween fan would like John Carpenter's 1978 version to be better. Michael Myers is one of the coolest killers in any film, and he is very well known. So, by all means, you see this masterpiece that you will like very much.
