** Possible spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually typed in comedy, but in "Reign", it gives a very touching performance. While there are people who showed Courage before September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widower who is alone and "lost in his world". Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his old college friend ( Sandler) and wants to recover the "Old Time". Let's see, as in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman also gets excited and finds himself in stressful situations. The music of the elderly seems to be a comfort and a "psychological" crutch for him to lean on. <br /> <br /> Johnson seeks, in Fineman, that a certain pleasure and ease his family. He too feels unhappy and dissatisfied with his work. At the same time, he also wants to make sure his friend doesn't fall through the social "cracks". I came out of this film, with a different and more comprehensive perspective Compassion for grieving families.
