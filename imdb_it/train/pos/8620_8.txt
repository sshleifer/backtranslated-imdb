I just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were amazed. I will not worry about repeating what others have said. What filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The enormous battle is exhausting. Later we were surprised to find that there were still about 30 minutes left but that didn't stop us from being completely involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost ruined everything and that was the horrible Scores / Songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we burst out laughing. It's horrible. You have been warned, but the story and the story keep you stuck. <br /> <br /> There are many exceptional moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence and slow motion photography that work beautifully. I really wish I could erase the music but, alas. <br /> <br /> Look for it. It's fun, it's different and takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.
