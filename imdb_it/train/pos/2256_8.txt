He didn't know what to expect from Van Damme's partner / friend / trainer and his fight choreographer for most of his films. It was good to see him acting as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damme movies. Now he is alone." He and his wife form a great team, in this Qissi is the action director and leads the villain and he is. The wife was the writer, producer and director of most of the scenes that did not require action, she also did a good job in the editing of the film.And together they did a great job. The story made sense, the fighting scenes were well cared for, the protagonists were real fighters and they seemed to fit together - the story came together well, and if you can believe ... no bad language, no sex, just action. A new one on me.
