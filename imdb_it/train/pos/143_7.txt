Riget II is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first. This series doesn't seem to be as serious as the first one. There are many other comedies in this one, good though. <br /> <br /> We are back to the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse is about to leave the hospital while her job is finished, but fate wants it to be otherwise. Soon he is chasing the ghosts and Helmer is driving everyone crazy and soon it will be much worse as the black powers unleash themselves in the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story involves much more comedy than the previous one. By all means a lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. History has retained many elements from the last series and added new ones. It is well written, but some of the new elements are simply stupid, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Beautiful story, but not as beautiful, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with some additions to the normal cast. They are all very good. It's a strange story and setting. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show to keep it serious and keeping it real is not an easy job. However, these actors handle the whole situation perfectly. <br /> <br /> Much of the good qualities of the first series are kept intact. Cinematography is one of those qualities. The freehand camera that made Trier famous gives suspense and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow characters, and Trier uses these abilities. Good, movement, great lighting and good composition and editing make it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Prepare to see a better effect in this sequel than in the first one. Also prepare to see more. I didn't think the green thing was too good. I thought it was unoriginal and not suitable. Nevertheless, effects like ghosts are really good. Even non-digital effects look good. The little brother seems really strange, but you accept it. In all I would say that the effects range from OK to good. <br /> <br /> The music is also quite good. Moody and likeable. Some are really touching. It fits really well. As a first, there is little music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All this makes a good sequel. If you had seen Riget, you can see it without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two are a series you wouldn't want to miss.
