Peter Falk is a different and accomplished actor. The film is well written and the acting seems like a real life. For all Columbo lovers this is an excellent job. Because it shows that Peter Falk is a talent. He doesn't play a detective, he plays a retired carpet salesman. When the credits start the role, you want to see it again. The interesting part of the film is that the message will be applied to all the people watching it; the depth of its relevance will be the only thing that varies. It is a pity that Hollywood liberals only promote smog and leather because this is the kind of film that business people should be proud of. This would be a great movie to turn into a live theatrical performance.
