I was surprised how a movie could be both fun and excellent at the same time. Frisbee's flying saucer was beyond comprehension, especially when it was landing, however the special effects when the Krell attacked were fantastic for a film made over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East, I saw the shadows of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggested to Alta that she dress more modestly, and as an engineer he was surprised by the imagination used for the "futuristic" gadgets and by the devices invented by the materials department of scene. All in all, an hour and a half of fun, the first time I see Walter Pidgeon and the chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young man"
