I could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best films ever made". If you think that Vanilla Sky is simply a "re-make", you could not be more wrong. There is an enormous depth in this film: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (first scenes with Sofia) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climatic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds are perfectly linked to this film. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson has created an exciting but eclectic soundtrack that could not have been more suited to such a dreamy theme (although it was never published, I managed to get my hands on the original score for about $ 60., You might be able to find a copy). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etc. etc., are also perfect for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes of this film (such as love, sadness, regret) are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as by the brilliant dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes from time to time. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film however (as if it could improve) is that it is so clever that every time you see the movie, you will see something new, so watch carefully and prepare to think! Of course, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second round, but there is always something more than what you think. <br /> <br /> This is without doubt the best work of Cameron Crowe, and quite a work of genius. Much of my film and music inspiration comes from this work alone. He has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency to do. I am continually surprised that there are many people who do not like this film for what it is (I believe that understanding true art is an art in itself). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a category of its own.
