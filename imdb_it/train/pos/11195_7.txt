The title has many meanings: the ring, where differences and complaints are fought, a wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels that his problems will be over and the cause of the problem, a bracelet similar to a ring that Bill gives Mabel like a token of love. <br /> <br /> The former professional boxer, the Danish Carl Brisson, has been included in the Alfred Hitchcock films in "The Ring". A very young Ian Hunter, who has had such a long career in cinema, plays Bob Corby, who captures the attention of a pretty girl, Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) at a fun fair. She happens to be engaged to "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) but this does not prevent her from flirting with Bob. Bob is convinced to make a "round" with Jack. He makes several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager came to the fair to find out if Jack is a good fighter as they heard. He offers to take Jack and Jack leaves, along with his rude trainer (the great Gordon Harker) to make a fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he is good. Jack wins his battle and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep attraction she and Bob feel for each other is still there. Jack is suspicious and puts everything in his training so that he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally a boxing film in which the hero does not leave the rails - Bob behaves and does whatever he can be a champion - if only Mabel acted the same way !!! He left it for Bob - and the fight is powerful in the end. It is intensely realistic - it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. Being raw and enthusiastic, Jack is almost eliminated - so between a round and the reunion with Mabel, he gives him the courage to triumph. The question is: why would he want her back - from the beginning he didn't think of starting a relationship with Bob - why wouldn't he do it again? <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbolism. Jack, shaking hands with the promoter, passes to Mabel's hands accepting a Bob bracelet. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, Bobs's bracelet slides down his arm. In the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a bucket of water in the front row and this gives him the confidence to move forward. This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
