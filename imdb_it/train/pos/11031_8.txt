Sly's best action movie. It is a superb and amusing film with some interesting characters, solid performances and the direction of Renny Harlins is elegantly assured. Rarely Stallone is so interesting in his action films and certainly has a role in terms of action scenes. This was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and entertaining of the 90s, a defined classic genre. As a Stallone fan, this is one I look at with good memories. Lots of superb action and Sly in first person. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the distinctive features that make a good movie aciton. The film looks fantastic and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
