War Inc. is a funny but strange film. The actors are nice, the film is also nice, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I'll go later in the plot. This is a film with some strange casting choices. In addition to John Cusack as a successful man, whom we saw years ago in Grosse Point in white that I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something. His character is strange. There is a scene in which he attacks a scorpion along his pants. And it hits Hauser (Cusack). There is a turning point in the end that involves the two characters. Does this make sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only casting choice I'm about to take. Because it's just weird. The whole film is strange. But sometimes incredibly funny and I was never bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Miss Duff excluded. She is not exceptional. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a Middle Eastern city to hit an oil man named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to address his personal problems, he must help a popstar's marriage (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a journalist (played by Marisa Tomeii). But there is something in the popstar. Hauser is disgusted with her. There is a scene where she is singing a song for him and then throws it up. <br /> <br /> The blow at the end of the film reveals a little why. The important thing is that I saw it coming. But it does not matter. This is a strange, fun and funny comedy. I love most of the actors. So really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
