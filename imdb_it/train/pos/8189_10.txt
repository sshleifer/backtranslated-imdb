This was an excellent 2-part episode, although I had never seen the older ones, I never thought the doctor would face anything that was paranormal, extra terrestrial of course but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things we most fear and how we humans, in a futuristic moment, will fight and defeat the real live evil when most chances say it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> Being that it is a family film I am surprised that they have brought some things like fear and faith, especially if also to entertain the American public. But who cares about what the Yanks say, let's rock! Doctor Who has shown the potential since the episode of the new series in 2005, before being so harmless as scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. I hope that many old fans will soon say "Old Doctor Who is back". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
