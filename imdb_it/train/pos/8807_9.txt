This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists from around the world. The documentaries are varied and deal with all types of concepts, the only thing that is shared is September 11th as a theme (in some cases very minor). Some of the segments are weak while others are very strong; some are politicians, others are not; some are only on 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This film has not been censored by anyone in any way, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments can really tick the right people (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber return as spirits, another from the United Kingdom recounting the killing of US-backed Chile on 11 September 1973 , which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities). The segment of Mexico was the most powerful, telling the fall of the towers and the consequent death in a vivid way (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> Even if the final product is not uniform, with some segments they are almost "useless", I recommend it anyway. It is very difficult to classify this film because the segments vary all over the place (some weak, some very powerful;). I give a score of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered by problems that are usually censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
