Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with this replay value are few and far between. Moreover, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels each with different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very demanding, but its lack of challenge takes nothing away from the game. Once defeated, you will want to cancel the game and start again. And it is just as fun the second time, or the third time, or the 200th time. A must for any Nintendo 64 owner, and a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64.
