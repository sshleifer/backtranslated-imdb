Oh, where are you going, my little one, baby ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> I remember these shows when they were broadcast for the first time on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, excited by the explanations of Werner Van Braune on rocket science. I looked at how history, science and humor were all intertwined in a compelling story of possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what a treasure they are. I saw them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who wouldn't even have entered the room at first, but later changed her mind when she saw that they were partly animated. As he watched I looked at her, and in the end she was almost as absorbed as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are a young wife with your daughters ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself thinking that my daughter's teacher could show them to her class, not only as a 50-year-old craftsman, but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history. <br /> <br /> Turn around, turn around, turn around and again ... you're wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.
