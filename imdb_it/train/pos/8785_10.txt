Some say that "The game is the most important thing", or something like that, is attributed to that old bard of Avon, himself, William Shakewspeare. if it wasn't for Will, it could have been our director, the super-veteran, Raoul Walsh. There are many of his films that support this hypothesis. No one is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also won another award, having been named as Errol Flynn's favorite of his own vehicles. It clearly provides on-screen proofs that could easily take viewers into the darkened theater or display them on their home TV or DVD, to conclude the same. <br /> <br /> To be sure, the story is a semi-serious Biopic, which takes a portion of factual material and mixes it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying West, even if in some way fictionalized (what is not Biopic?). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our protagonist, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although it is not a Swashbuckler, a Western or a War Picture, this GENTLEMAN JIM is perhaps the leading role that was the most suitable for the harsh Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian boxing Olympic team in both 1928 or 1932. His "sweet science" preparation and skills are clearly highlighted during the film and especially in the "Big Fight "for the World Heavyweight Championship with the great John L. Sullivan, Himself. by Ward Bond) The cast reads like a service roster for players who support Warner Brothers. Presents Alan Hale as Jim Corbet's father, a Livery Wagon operator *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two "blue men" of the family, their occupations are declared as "Longshormen". <br /> <br /> The great Jack Carson makes his usual majestic comedy-serious performance in support as a friend and bankmate of Jim Corbett. The rest of what we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn to name just a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh has also used a number of Pro Wrestlers in the roles of various boxers. So we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and an unknown Grappler * are present as the 2 pugs on the waterfront in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (never heard of him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful and unpolished look on them that the old Pier 9 fighters would have possessed. <br /> <br /> We haven't forgotten the Leading Lady, Alexis Smith. He is powerful in his characterization of an "independent" woman, but retains enough real skill as a comic actor in many scenes. She shows a wide range in her part of poor little rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix the elements in appropriate proportions to give it the right blend. Well, the director Walsh does it with a reckless abandon. Because he is looking, above all, for a great film. His treatment shows all the skills he had honed to a setup from his days as a player with D.W. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special passion for that period, 1890. *** Mr. Walsh's direction moves through the script to a fairly fast clip, breaking the exposure scenes with a funny beat, "the Corbetts are at again!" Therefore, it is able to maintain a light touch, even humorous, in a story that could become too faded and serious. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh offers us an authentic look of a San Francisco from the 90s. And as a further example of his passion for that period, he creates ample and dynamic images of the historic Prize Fights. There is a vibrant, joyful state of mind transmitted in those boxing scenes. As a crowning achievement of this film, perhaps underestimated, director Walsh gave the image as if it were an illustration of The Police Gazette, which dealt with these events in those "old days". <br /> <br /> But there is only one thing to remember before seeing. If it's for the first time, or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "CORBETTI ARE AGAIN !!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion as a historian of both film and Pro Wrestling, he resembles Tor Johnson, who years later was a favorite of Ed Wood's director. <br /> <br /> ** A 'Livery' is a somewhat archaic term for a rental vehicle for urban transport premises. <br /> <br /> *** It is true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a Griffith Veteran Player. He was the actor who played John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Being born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his memories of the 1890s and the Sullivan-Corbett Championship and what it meant for the sporting life in America of those days.
