Sweet and charming, fun and moving, less significant but significant, "Before Sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film, is dedicated to all those who have ever been in love, in love or have never been in love but continue to dream of it and hope to find it. It is one of the very rare films that is / should / will be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple little film without spectacular visual effects, car chases or long and smoky sex scenes. Two young people in their twenties, two university students (the American tourist Ethan Hawke who returns home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend classes in the Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other immediately before they even start talking, they jump off the train in Vienna, where they walk to explore the city all night. They talk and fall in love. Here, this is the film. It may have been boring and silly, but instead, it's a beautiful, believable, intelligent and moving love story that only improves with each vision (at least, for this viewer). Praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and screenwriters for the delivery of two fascinating characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two fantastic shows and the magic atmosphere that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like Botticelli's angel, is very good at portraying an intelligent, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
