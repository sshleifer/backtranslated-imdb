The story of a recruiting camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war, is truly moving. Human study has always attracted me when it comes to war films, because it translates personal and subjective opinions about war, action films opposed to war in which action and technical data are analyzed to the detriment of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in giving a new twist to an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from the usual war films, above all by focusing on an anti-hero from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who cleverly avoids being sucked into the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, he spends his energies searching for ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and his companions and, ironically, he ends up finding his right reason to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> The acting is truly exceptional, and documentary-style filming almost makes you transpose into the film. Furthermore, the film will provide food for thought for those enthusiastic about the action in the usual war movies or war game enthusiasts, hoping to awaken some minds of a generation that fortunately escaped the terror of being drafted.
