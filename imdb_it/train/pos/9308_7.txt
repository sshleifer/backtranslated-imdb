If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in important roles like Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects I suggest you take a look at this movie. Even if you are not a Gabriel Byrne fan in particular, all the actors in this movie really give great performances. If you have about eleven dollars (which is close to nine pounds) I say order it online, or rent it from your favorite movie rental place. Guaranteed to make you laugh, even if you don't like gangster-type movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you never forget and you find yourself constantly looking. You'll talk so much about it that your friends will beg you to borrow it.
