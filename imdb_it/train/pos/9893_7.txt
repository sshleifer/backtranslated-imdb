Poor fanatic Marty (Simon Scuddamore) gets horribly upset because of a cruel acrobatics on an April Fool's day that went very badly. Flashes a decade ahead and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to horror fans for her Maniac, Faceless & The Last Horror Film turns) in the hoax are excited about the 10-year high school meeting not knowing a judge masked by the jester the killer hides in the school (now closed) and seeks revenge. <br /> <br /> Chaulk this up to be a guilty pleasure, I knew it's a bad movie. It has all the features of one. Yet there is only something that makes me feel forced to watch it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I'm also willing to neglect the absolutely horrible ending (which, I must say, hate), I think I like it because it has a fun atmosphere and some pretty interesting killings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager get both topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for women): a free cock shot by Simon Scuddamore all beginning of the movie <br /> My Brothers: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional Trivia; trailer for this film; and trailer for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
