One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving. This is an action melodrama like the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the plot made me almost cry, while in a moment I revealed shocking revelations like a crushing blow to the bowels. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The story of a Hong Kong policeman and a Cambodian killer chasing each other, while gradually losing their humanity, is strong. Characterized by a very little dialogue in favor of disturbing images and a gritty photographic work, "Dog bite Dog" is pure bloodshed without heroism.
