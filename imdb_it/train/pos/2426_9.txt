"Once in the life" is a great movie. However it is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some situations. The film manages to depict "life" in New York neighborhoods where drug problems are important. This representation is in turn used as decoration for a more thoughtful and suspenseful drama, supported by powerful dialogues (however I had difficulty understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue. There is a bit of overplaying sometimes, but I think it fits quite well with the general orientation that Fishburne gave to the film, which gives importance to the reflection rather than just being a good exercise in style, especially in the time / management of the action. although not simple, they are easy to relate to and the actors do a great job of imposing them. Among other things, I really enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis) .If you are not too rude, you should enjoy seeing that movie once , two, three times, I evaluated the 9/10 film.
