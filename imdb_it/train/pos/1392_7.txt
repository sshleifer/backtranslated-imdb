Shocking low budget, bizarre, exciting, to forget and to tell about the Williams family, who lives in the California desert. They become witnesses to a series of events that intensify their level of extraneousness; apparently, they have been caught in a space-time distortion, where past, present and future collide. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a parade of very funny special effects - a constant light and a sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that exchange with each other, a small and friendly ET who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. This image shows a little imagination, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful music by Richard Band, involving special effects by David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a nice family is a fundamental asset. It generates a sense of childish astonishment; it could be that it is more of a romp for children (or children within many of us) who are able to overlook any flaw in the narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet diversion (80 minutes), and a fair credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (from "Kingdom of the Spiders") and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
