Hello: <br /> <br /> I've heard of a lost person from a colleague who has had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. Well, I watched an episode or 2 in the first few seasons and I was bored, so I tuned it. After a few years I came across lost; bored with the current sci-fi rate. Wow, I was surprised. You can say gravity well, dammit, I was sucked. The pace and the scripts are very good, some of the forward / back flashes are so-so with Lamer's characters, but above all good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are decidedly immature attackers, very spoiled and immature. Kate stepped over them, Juliet was much more elegant than Kate. Mr. Eko underestimated and at Charlie's level if not more so, too bad that both are dead. The boy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a real curiosity. Overall, grand and highly layered series: looking for others. <br /> <br /> greetings
