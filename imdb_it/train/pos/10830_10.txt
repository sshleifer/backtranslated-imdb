I liked Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen in years. A successful band from the 70s decide to try again. They begin to play some concerts in some squalid European places, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are fantastic. The characters are clear, especially the singer with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality issues. The concert was ultimately unreal. Go see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
