I think the opening of 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting films, with the brilliant soundtrack that works to build tension in a shocking climax. What film-goers did about it in the 1930s, I can only imagine. The "Times" at the time said: "A miracle has arrived on the screen". Watch it and wonder.
