This and "Hidden Fortress" are the Kurosawa that are dearest to me. I don't distribute 10 like candy, but this certainly deserved it, if anything. Although it is quite long (as almost all Kurosawas are) it has allowed the problem that bothers me with most of his films; the plot is often too slow and slowly evolving, containing unnecessary or only too large scenes without any real purpose for the character's plot or description. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience that, for example, he did "Hidden Fortress"; despite its duration, there was not a single minute that I would have cut off. <br /> <br /> This is also a very unusual Kurosawa film in a sense, it has no plot, but many small independent stories that are based more on character description than plot, unlike any other Kurosawa film I've seen so far. He also places a lot on dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between the father and the son who plan their "new home"). <br /> <br /> Still the thing that makes this masterpiece is how the subject is as tragic as it is, it has managed to be described in such a human and comprehensive way, without pointing fingers at any point. From beginning to end it carries the entire emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
