This is an excellent film. It concerns many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the push of a man and the relationship between this man (the main detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> the one that attacks me the most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (sorry bad spelling, please!). For some reason, it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turn into respect, camaraderie and collaboration. A line of the film summarizes all this: "He would say something witty, but he is overwhelmed with emotion". <br /> <br /> Excellent acting of the whole cast, even the smallest parts have been made with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast-paced action thriller; in fact, sometimes it moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfying and not exploiting crimes. <br /> <br />
