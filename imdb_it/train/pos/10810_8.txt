Very well done film. It remains in your memory. Better advertised as a love story than flying or war, even if the flying parts are realistic and almost error-free. Flight enthusiasts like me will love this movie even if they are attracted to airplanes, unless they are sensitive or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch Crowe soon. He is good and exudes charm. His "High Flight" reading is superb. <br /> <br /> thanks, Boom
