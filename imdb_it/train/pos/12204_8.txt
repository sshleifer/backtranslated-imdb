One can only imagine the film that Mr. Welles could have ended up without the interference of the studio! This film is an imperfect Welles, but it's worth every minute because you can see the greatness of perhaps the best film director of America of all time! <br /> <br /> We can see the balance sheet of Orson Welles filming this movie. The story has many holes, perhaps due to the demands of the studio executives who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions presented to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when they should be all those directors who must be considered followers of the great master himself . No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. Fortunately we still have his legacy in retrospective looks like what the New York Film Forum has just ended, or his films on tape or on DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been photographed more lovingly than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, like a blonde, she is simply too beautiful for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have made this film another masterpiece to add to the work of Orson Welles, was his appearance. If he concentrated on directing and played another actor Michael O'Hara, a different film could have been made at all. Orson Welles must be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot on the street. The images in this film are so incredible that we leave the theater after seeing this film really impressed with the work, the vision and the talent it gave us.
