We tend to forget that the master / slave context of past centuries has led to more than well-maintained properties, fed by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for white owners. It led to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring from the slave owners who interfered with their slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children became more slaves, and others were free ... but free and colorful, which at that time meant everything except in relation to the fate of their fathers. <br /> <br /> A class formed around this offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of color - and that class was able, to a certain extent, to possess property, rise from trampled to polite and reach a comparative dignity. I mean, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> Often, women lived as lovers of plantation masters and wealthy white men, installed in their own homes, with compensation, schooling paid for their children, and a kind of kindness, dependent on respectability that they have chosen to impose on their families. In essence, they prostituted themselves to ensure their prosperity and relative independence from work - an agreement called pla√ßage. <br /> <br /> The Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one of these women, the result of such a deal with a local gentleman and the people who touched their lives, either way negative than positive. The story opened my eyes, a New Zealander, without a true conception of the white / black lines, not to mention that gray area in the middle where the gens de couleur moved cautiously. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and have been well rendered in this adaptation of the novel, by Anne Rice. The parts are well expressed, the costumes are wonderful and the brutal way to draw lines, with the blurred areas made even more distinct by the conflicts that the protagonists go through. The gens de couleur libre could not marry whites, slaves could not help themselves, and whites, even understanding ones, could not bear to face the economic reality of doing well to the people they depended on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, without reservation. If you cannot manage the truth, you will be ashamed of some parts, because one injustice and the other is satisfied on those of color, both by their white oppressors and by their own people. But remember that this is nothing but reality, and this story is an absorbing way to know it. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound insensitive, but this miniseries amused me and fascinated me, despite the bitter taste I found in my mouth, and I loved it. Watch it. If you do not read about the period, because there is a lesson to be learned from everything.
