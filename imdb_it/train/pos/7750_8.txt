Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows while singing an EUS song. Anarchy dominates a logical and common effort of thoughts. The story behind this film is just the way the wind blows. And this can really be refreshing to look at, if you're prepared and willing. Viewers who claim that there is nothing to keep the story lines together are right. Who the hell is that Windman? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, animated and lively place and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures the stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, dependencies and violence that survives unnoticed in a seemingly welcoming city. The film is fun, funny and a bit superficial. Barman's film debut will not have such a heavy impact as his musical debut. In that light some may be disappointed. But still, "Worst scenario" would be a subtle caption for Any Way the Wind Blows.
