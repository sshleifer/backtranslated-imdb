I was a little skeptical if I had to watch it when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in New York that day, I was going to school at Hunter College. I didn't want to see all the devotion and massacre again, but like many I was curious to see what it was. My tears came to watch this documentary. All my memories are back and only the intense images were incredible. I bought the DVD for the first anniversary and watched it a couple of times. How these guys managed to capture this movie was incredible. If you haven't seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and take a look. It is obviously depressing and will bring tears to the eyes, but it is an incredible document of this darkest hour in the countries.
