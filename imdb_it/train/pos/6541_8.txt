Having grown up in the mid-1940s, I'm not even close to any of Nancy Drew's key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; so, I could tell, they were the sixty-six silver-haired ladies coming down from me. The older man who left the theater a little way ahead of me praised in particular the film for the 20-year-old female usher (who said she saw the movie the night before and she definitely liked it). <br /> <br /> the point, however: in the row just ahead of me, there were nine: count them, girls of nine - ten years in a row next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, you are promptly settled in to watch .... <br /> <br /> .... and they didn't even peek around until the end credits started rolling . <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; it does not pay enough the subplots of his high school, he is not quite sure of his tone, and his hooligans are just a hair too far away from the sometimes inept critics. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs quite well, and skilfully moves between the sins of excessive curiosity and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts brings the film with surprising grace - despite Josh Flitter's superb period, this is Roberts's film, and he does it beautifully. His Nancy Drew is the direct ancestor of Kristen Bell's Veronica Mars, and the film is also a direct descendant of Jodie Foster's "Candleshoe", initially undervalued. <br /> <br /> In today's market, it's a rarity: a film for families that respects the intelligence of the spectators. As such, it won't be for everyone's taste - but for what it is, it's the best film of its kind for decades.
