The film version of the highly emotional and influential 1983 novel by Alice Walker (written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God) was a huge Oscar success, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of the abused and awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave his best screen for miles. Not far from her was Oprah Winfrey like Sofia, the fiery woman domesticated by fate. Others in the cast have enriched the characters that Walker had presented so clearly on the page: Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's violent husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force for change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the much missed Carl Anderson (otherwise known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as a preacher Samuel. <br /> <br /> Beautifully and sensitively written, "The Color Purple" does justice to its source by opening up the story to engage viewers with a feature film.
