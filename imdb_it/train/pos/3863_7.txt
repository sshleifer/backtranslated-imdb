This is an interesting series that takes real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) and dramatizes part of their true story with a character from the series participating in that story. Rail Detective "Matt Clark" - plays a role in tracking down famous Old West outlaws in stories that are at least partly based on true stories. In this sense, it is almost a series of anthologies and, as someone else has pointed out, this strange structure poses some temporal conflict with real events, but it is a fun series with a lot of action to satisfy a western 50's hungry - and still resists quite well 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western armor as he faces some of the meanest villains in history. And her girlmate Frankie is quite a dish. If you are a Western fan, be sure to check if you have a chance.
