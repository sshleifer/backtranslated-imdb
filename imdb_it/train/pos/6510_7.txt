Actually I really like what I've seen of this cartoon so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but frankly, I would prefer to see this kind of more comics style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply (which was starting to happen more and more often ... it's just one style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is spent). There's nothing wrong with angular lines and small black-dot eyes - in fact, I think it's really nice. As a child I never thought that Scooby-Doo's design was particularly adorable, but I think I'd like it better to know. <br /> <br /> However, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for some depth. Of course, the show does not focus on the original "Mystery-resolving" theme, but it was still just an old tired formula. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring much more interest in the traditional activities of Mystery Inc. (which has been missing until later), but in the meantime this show is a funny deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still fun, but no longer just comic relief. They are still cowards, but finally have the opportunity to use what appears to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old idlers who eat too much, but now they really seem to go on with their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's legacy. <br /> <br /> I used to find the most original Scooby-Doo lines to be pure cheese and unintentionally exhilarating at best, but this show actually has a capacity for true humor. Besides, I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor doesn't bother me as much as he does with other people. (I still think that Billy West was the best, anyway) <br /> <br /> Overall, although it wasn't a big cartoon in the whole history of cartoons, it's still a result among the other incarnations of Scooby.
