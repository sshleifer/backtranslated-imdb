In 2054 Paris, Avalon, a computerized system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective Karas (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance is a splendid blend of films blending with a futuristic conceptual narrative that illuminates the screen in a shocking manor with a noir-themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many. <br /> <br /> Pixars are the masters of animation. Their numerous Oscar-winning films are endless from the fascinating Toy Story to the mysterious Wall-E and therefore every company or director has a real challenge to make them fall on their perch. However, Renaissance is not a film for young audiences and, like Persepolis in 2007, offers a strong and mature approach to the animation genre to make a film older and more challenging for older generations. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez published a surprising and brilliant Noir Sin City that shook the whole use of the green screen with a splendid balance of black and white shots with strange flashes of color and a year later, Christian Volckman took a similar approach with this visually masterful image of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The image of Volckman is however a complete animation, but it does not seem at all realistic for most of its fort 1 hour and 40 minutes of duration. The faces of the characters are well represented and, in particular, this film must be the most refined ever for the use of the shadow. The fact that we never know if his night or day is irrelevant when we simply look at the stony faces while the shadows blend into their expressions. It is almost an intelligent use of pathetic fallacy, and it is also finely directed. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, you will have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best direct animations ever projected for the simple but the highly conceptual artistic style of Marjane Satrapi <br /> <br /> Renaissance is equally in line with that photo and in many cases rivals it with a stronger graphic and a darker tone to reflect the atmosphere. A scene in particular when Karas appears out of the darkness is magnificently revived. <br /> <br /> The narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosy political government that keeps an eye on every citizen. The Paris race is due to the mysterious Avalon that we don't see enough to get an essence of its true domain. The Renaissance is checking the story around the attempts of a policeman tired of saving the mysterious woman, and then we see Craig's tired and boring policeman trying to save while fighting with other elements. There are many things wrong with the script, not to mention the exasperated routine of an old cop, but there's a lot of adrenaline and endless pranks between the characters to keep him alive until an incredibly beautiful twist.
