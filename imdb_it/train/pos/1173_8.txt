"Night of the Living Homeless" was a pretty strong ending for the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, especially Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, like creatures that nourish and thrive outside the reserve change rather than the brain. <br /> <br /> Kyle is accused of the sudden mass homeless explosion when, for the goodness of his heart, he gives $ 20 to a homeless man in front of his House. Other homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the city is completely invaded by them. This is a very strong episode of Randy Marsh, as he takes on the role of the armed leader of adult shotguns that take refuge on the roof of the Park Community Center. But before Randy gets to the center of the community, he is approached by hundreds of homeless people while screaming hilariously "I have no change !!" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by taking a bus out of town, and unwittingly throws away all his bus changes to distract the homeless. Then he becomes one of them, asks everyone to change. <br /> <br /> The boys try to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homelessness studies. They find out that the nearby town of Evergreen had a similar problem with the homeless, so they fled to Evergreen to find out what they were doing to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the homeless break into the man's house and he tries to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until his death. This scene could have been more fun if a similar scene hadn't happened in "Fantastic Easter Special" two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a refugee member discovers that due to homelessness, property values ​​have declined, so the bank foreclosed his home, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns it over, holding the gun on the man's head. When the man finally begs others for a few dollars to help him, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, the boys discover that the citizens of the city have sent homeless people to South Park, and that the passage of homeless people from one city to another takes place throughout the country. The boys modify a bus that takes the homeless out of South Park and takes them to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> The parallels of the zombie movies and the lines of Randy Marsh make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10
