This is my second time for A Perfect Spy. I looked at it 2 or 3 years ago and I liked it. I still like it. It is natural that he is compared to the other great series of Beeb's Le Carre, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" spy game; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person is a spy. There are a number of themes that these films share, along with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - which creates a multidimensional space of true versus false, internal against external, love and responsibility. In a sense, these characters are happier when they are treated more bleakly by those they love and respect - "stabbed in the back" in its various shades. <br /> <br /> The theme of fathers and father figures is also important. One of A Perfect Spy's most intriguing characters is Rick, the main character of Magnus, perhaps a surrogate for his father. Throughout history he betrays and is betrayed. A thief who always manages to climb the ladder when he has been knocked over, who seems impervious to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet, "Do you love your old man?" and never, "Do you love me?" Maybe he says it somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another theme is that of malice. The nature of the business is to transform others - turn them against their government, against their friends and associates, transform them against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carre films I saw, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, Looking Glass War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People and A Perfect Spy, shooting and filming is the foundation of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only a single pistol shot, or perhaps two shots that close the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always beneath the surface. We see their results not as streams of blood or damp prison cells, but in the objects that the characters of Le Carré cling to while they are inevitably sucked into the swamp. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movies above, and you enjoy A Perfect Spy, you're ready for a surprise. I also recommend the Sandbagger (Yorkshire TV) series, the second and third season, which are beginning to reach this level of complexity. The IPCRESS file and the burial in Berlin are beautiful, even if light. For political intrigue, try A Very British Coup, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only one Brit had decided to create The Three Kingdoms, there would have been a film with intrigue and complexity.
