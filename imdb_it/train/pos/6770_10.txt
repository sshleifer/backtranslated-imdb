Airwolf The Movie, A variation on the original 2-part pilot, yet the film, although shorter, contains an additional video in Unseen in the 2-hour pilot. The pilot is much more than a pilot of the movie Where, as a pilot film is normally the same (2 parter combined) But the film is actually a different modification with extras here and cuts there. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look, even if you have the season 1 DVD set, I would still like to get a copy of the "movie" It's still in some stores like Virgin, Woolworth and media stores mixed, although it generally needs orders, but saves the need to shop online (as many of us still don't or don't trust online shopping) but if you look around you airwolf in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf it really was one of the shows under the 80s. <br /> <br /> An Airwolf is currently being rebuilt for a helicopter museum:) Info and work in progress The images are finished on http://Airwolf.org Even with Airwolf's Mods for games Flashpoint and Flight Sim. Looks like she's finally staying.
