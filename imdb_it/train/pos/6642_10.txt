All films made before 1912 really need to be seen with a sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the men of the Lumiere family [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and operated a factory that manufactured plates and photographic paper. Not a small business; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security subsidies, innovative at the time. He was in Montplaisir, in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What prompted Louis Lumiere to take an interest in the construction of a Cinematagraph in 1894 remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Kinetoscope (peep-show machine) of Edison's organization, in Paris during the autumn of 1894, provided the catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, from Edison's staff, invented a cinematographic camera the size of an upright patented in February 1893. It was electrically powered (using energy from heavy accumulators) This huge strip of machine-pumped celluloid film (newly developed) from the Eastman company) over a lens at about 40 frames per second (fps). It was hidden, like an almost immobile object, in the "Black Maria" (essentially the first film studio). Kinetescope machines showed presentations on stage (less than a minute) that were shot in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a movie camera. He had established it, even at 16 fps in celluloid film, the persistence of the vision of the human eye / brain would allow us to perceive normal movement. His camera, nicknamed Cinematograph, was the size of a large shoebox and received a Removable movie magazine that provided storage for enough movies to make a shoot takes about a minute when the 16 fps lens was crossed. <br /> <br /> The size and light weight of the camera (it could be converted into a printer or projector by adding a light source) made it portable enough to be taken anywhere to record an event (as long as there was enough sunlight available). In the spring of 1895, Louis turned: trick-riding by some cavalrymen; a house on fire with firefighters arriving and making water in the swallowed building; and a series of other scenes in Lyon and its environs. Using a Molteni light bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to the scientists gathered in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science. The images were projected on a screen five meters away from the lens. The screen was stretched on a door between two rooms. In a meeting of professional photographers, in the same year, Louis photographed the incoming delegates and the same evening he showed them the moving images of their arrival. <br /> <br /> With awards from both scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his own invention by the end of the year. Given that each of his films would be about a minute long, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he installed his camera at the entrance of his factory, photographing the release of employees when they left. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine - which offered itself as "fair barker" "for the Cinematograph - was the Salon Indien of the Grand Cafe on the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris. It was a winter Saturday evening December 28, 1895. While the first audience was sitting, a projection of the exterior of the Lumiere factory was presented (with closed doors). Some were disappointed that they were about to see a routine slide show of Lumiere photographs, but then the crank of the camera / projector was shot and the movement started. Louis had an innate sense for the film. This film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the beginning, the doors are opened and people start to leave the their place of work: during the vehicle, people escape - with many trying to ignore the camera, and the cameraman, as they seem happy to leave a day of work behind them. <br /> <br /> And this was the first film screened for general public entertainment.
