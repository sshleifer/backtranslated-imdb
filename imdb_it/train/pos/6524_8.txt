<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate films, New Orleans / early nineteenth century American history or Yul Brynner, watch this movie for yourself and take your opinion about it. Don't be put off by various lackluster reviews. My reaction was that it's fun, well acted (for the most part), it has a very funny dialogue, and it does a great job in portraying the charm, the charm and the legendary charm of the corsair Jean Lafitte. Although not all the events of the film are historically accurate (can you show me some historical films that can do that?), I think the film is accurate in dealing with the role that Lafitte played in the history of New Orleans and the love-hate relationship between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Don't worry about what the film doesn't do, but look at it for what it does, that is for its study of one of the most intriguing historical figures in New Orleans and America.
