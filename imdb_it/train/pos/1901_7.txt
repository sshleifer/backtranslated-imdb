It's hard to put your finger on this. Basically I suppose it's a comedy about a wet and rich drunk who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl, who would like to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family. <br /> <br /> It has fun moments, romantic moments and moving moments. Dudley Moore is fun and somehow makes his self-centered character captivating, Liza Minelli is a convincing film like the exuberant opposite that attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show in the role of Arthur's sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It's cheesy but very fun with a memorable soundtrack, and it worked for almost 3 months in our local storm.
