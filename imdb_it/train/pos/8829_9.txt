More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger outlet for their talents. 7:35 De la ma√±ana is an absolute genius. What Nacho is able to broadcast in 8 minutes requires a few hours of Hollywood film as a director. I looked at him smiling, but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way. You sit and wonder how you should feel after seeing this 8 min. nugget. I was entertained, but at the same time I was disturbed. Not many people can do it in just 8 minutes. Start off simple enough. A young woman comes to breakfast in her usual place. He sits down and someone starts singing. From there, the film takes you through so many different emotions at once it's hard to describe. It is black and white, but this helps to hear the movie that gives you. This film makes you want to know more about the characters, how they interacted previously and how the ending had an impact on their lives later. I imagine it's like the old saying: "Let them want more", Nacho Vigalondo is able to do it. Watch this when you can. Show it to your friends and ask how 8 minutes can be so fun without taking your clothes off.
