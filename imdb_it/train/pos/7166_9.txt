Holes, the novel, was forced by me into a course of education. I didn't think I would like a novel for children; besides, the other couple of books that I was forced to read for the lesson were really bad. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It is indeed one of the most perfectly written novels I have ever read. I think it has the rare quality that makes it suitable for pre-teens, adolescents and adults. Anyone who reads, I think, will go away from a better person. Although I can't really say that for the film, I'm happy to say that they understood it better. I don't think the film's viewers will let themselves go as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of being more stupid when they sat down. It's a clever story, and it's very well told. I think it moves a little too quickly. The novel takes more time in developing the characters. And the flashbacks come and go so fast that they don't have too much time to register. The interracial love story of the past seems more clich√© and banal than it does in the novel. And the ending, which binds all the loose threads together, seems very ridiculous. It is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of the absurd that does not exist entirely in the film. It works much better. I also don't like the multitude of pop songs. I wish Disney didn't feel the need to sell soundtracks. The cast is excellent, from young to old professionals. Jon Voight is particularly exceptional. I'm not really sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze, though. 9/10.
