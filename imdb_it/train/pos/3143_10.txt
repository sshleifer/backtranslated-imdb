If any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it's this rare gem. It allows us to go back to a time when things were easier and more fun. Full of heart and laughter, this show makes you laugh through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful and even the drugs were tolerable. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller skates, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "a cane was a bad place to be". Take a trip back to the most beautiful time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and the essence of the small town where people were the nicest. This classic is on television as much as "Full House". Don't miss it, and always remember "Shake your groove thing !!!"
