I saw the show 10 years ago and I loved it !!! Now I'm in possession of the DVD and I was watching the series, and I was waiting for scenes that I knew were on the show (when Lucas confronts Gail in his house) and I realized that he was missing - suddenly I was looking at the seduction without the command on. Then I went online to check out all the star BIOS and found comments on end-of-life shows. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments indicate "Strangler number 19 then Triangle 20, when another turned them to the other side, and even Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6 were reversed as well. Can anyone clarify ?????
