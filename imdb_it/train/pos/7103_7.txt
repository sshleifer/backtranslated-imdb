I was quite surprised by this movie. Even if their project was obviously missing, you have to be struck by the fact that this film took 7 years to complete and still went well. The acting was pretty impressive and the story really fascinated me. My only complaint is that the finish was a little too sharp for my taste. But hey if your audience is left to desire more than this movie succeeded. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella Ríos who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now with the bad news about acting every day). Antonella Ríos is really a rising star.
