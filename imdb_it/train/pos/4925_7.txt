A "race against time" premise - A murderer of John Doe has a lung plague, so while the health authority and the NOPD fight everyone and everyone else trying to find his contacts on the waterfront, the killers think the heat is due to the victim's infected cousin he is holding on to them. <br /> <br /> This film is freely available on the Internet Archive and is worth downloading. A lot (all?) Of this film was shot in real places in New Orleans, which makes it interesting to see what is now the detail of the period, although to me it seems underexposed, even for the noir - maybe the installations furniture lighting were not what they are then. There is also a lot of location background noise, which is a bit of distraction - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are many non-professional support artists in the crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pace of the film is slightly down to begin with - not many chances to shoot or redo, although the final chase is worth the effort. Not even the main actors are grossly mistaken: Jack Palance is really scary as a charismatic and intelligent psychopath - the next scene, while alternately comforting and threatening his sick cousin, is magnificent, while Widmark, as he often did, launches the rage just the man on a mission to a credible level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should do it again: nothing supernatural, no mysticism, no special effects, just a good yarn full of conflicts between the characters, and a current issue. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and this is apt with the number of strange New Orleans types who engage in this dark, squalid, time-consuming drama. There's even a brat newspaper seller. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community? Do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
