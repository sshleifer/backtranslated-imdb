Due to the invention of a "domestication collar", carnivorous zombies are brought under control and become productive members of society; however, they perform humble tasks. The servile dead address those who live in small fenced towns of the fifties, while the indomitable zombies roam "The Wild Zone". In the town of "Willard", the pre-adolescent K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (like Helen and Bill Robinson). Alas, the Robinsons are the only family on their way that does not possess a zombie; their new neighbors, the Bottoms, have six. So to keep up, the Robinsons get the zombie Billy Connolly (like Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old lady's wayfarer and he eats it; then, new and hungry zombies infest the city. Meanwhile, young Ray became fond of Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like "Timmy and Lassie" on TV) and, the Robinson family has difficulty cooperating with the "Zomcom" control authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough in his intriguing "Wild Zone"; but it is a colorful, elegant and funny addition to the satirical cinematographic tradition of the zombies. Ray and the cast behave well, individually; with the unmarried zombie Sonja Bennett (like Tammy) and the owner Tim Blake Nelson (like Theopolis) the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and the crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), deservedly won awards. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
