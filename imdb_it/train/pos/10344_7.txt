Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell are the co-stars of "The Amazing Mr. Williams", a 1939 comedy / mystery that is quite good, though forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films released in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job, while his girlfriend expects a marriage that is constantly postponed. What happens in this film is no exception: he is called to a murder scene just as the corridor is about to descend once again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent at comedy, worked well together (and often), and helped make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are available for excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas doesn't do much about a woman. <br /> <br /> Funny if a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here has trashed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of movies like the other man and the best friend before he got into his old movies. He was not a lazy person, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it seem easy) who had a career on Broadway at the same time as his film career. He was simply not chosen as the protagonist in the films or played very demanding roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I Never Sang for my Father" and call him lazy or refer to his grin.
