In the ten years since Wildside went on air, nothing has really come close to its quality in local production. This includes the two series of funny, but overrated, Underbelly, which brought to life events in the recent criminal history of Sydney and Melbourne. The Blue Murder miniseries (which also starred in Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) could be the exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on ABC. Not looking at the show for a while, I'm still impressed by his uncompromising narrative lines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin is a detective obsessed with the death of his son, Rachael Blake (who later joined Martin in real life) as a community worker grappling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young man cop whose vice is gambling. Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie in person) and a young Abbie Cornish got equally good support roles. <br /> <br /> The ABCs inexplicably published only the first three episodes on DVD, a couple of years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is beyond me, but I suppose it may have something to do with the disagreement of the licenses with the original producers. <br /> <br /> A great series that has aged considerably well. Here is hoping that the DVD department of the ABC has its own point of view. <br /> <br /> (According to an ABC board moderator, some other DVD version is scheduled for December 2009)
