The best Modesty Blaise film I've seen so far. He's like a good pilot for a TV series. I even think it's a bit "cult", like with a light touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic, or something like that. They have captured a great deal of the Modesty character, but I admit I miss Willy Garwin a little. Although I've read a lot of comics and a book by Peter O'Donnell, I'm not disappointed with this movie, in fact. Positive surprise of this story about Modesty and her childhood. I didn't put my expectations so high because of the bad movie of 1966. So I might have passed this movie just a little bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see it! I can't wait for a sequel ...
