Now this is more like it! The first film had some uncertain dialogues and weaker acting, but it seems that the team behind it took their stuff together for the sequel and created a solid, extremely funny, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the threshold of their seats all the time. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is just full of great things, overflowing with creativity, and it's less of a parody of films from the 80s at the same time. The scenes in hell are great, as are those in the sky. There's really no shortage for the crazy-hood-adventurous romp that this promises, and you'll never see another movie like this. Even the final act of the film is not as bad as the first, being generally moving and pleasant in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family fun. And even Keanu Reeves, although he has about 30, is not so bad. <br /> <br /> It seems like a good deal.
