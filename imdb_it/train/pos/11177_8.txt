***** Spoilers herein ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Murder sharks or maybe ghosts trying to get a message back? Maybe a chainsaw wielding a psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But those fears are not even comparable to a horror that people don't even dare to talk about or consider - and this is the death of their own child. "Pet Sematary" touches this base, the fear of primary adults, and then takes it to places that most can not bear to explore. <br /> <br /> I have read comments on this film that include poor acting, characters who make stupid decisions, etc. I do not agree. Acting is really top quality for a film like this. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from this scenario. But the events of the film are not only logical, they can be absolutely inevitable if this scenario were possible. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": it is not that pets and people return from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes he does Luigi Creed. Despite warnings, or even past history. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who are willing to go with it into the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector who tries to make up for not being able to protect. And the results are horrible. In fact, when the film dives into the slasher territory towards the end, it's almost a disappointment, although I think it's perfectly logical how it got there. <br /> <br /> I am a true horror fan, and I maintain that this is one of the scariest horror movies ever made. If you don't think so, see her again after having children.
