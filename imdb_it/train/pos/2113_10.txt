The location of the store around the corner is specified at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest, but it could really be anywhere. The limited number of sets reflects a central European design, but it could be a shop around the corner. The film is not about Budapest or the retail trade in leather goods, but about the ups and downs of love, which are reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are field workmates but anonymous letters between them are full of hope, aspiration and romance, and the story unfolds to bring these two aspects together beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the shop owner, has problems with his wife, he has only one voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret relationship. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys his fur clothes. Mr Pirovitch's life is centered around his wife and children. Pepi Katona "plays Santa Claus" with a girl at Christmas. You feel that Flora Katchuck is quiet, while staying home with her mother dreams of someone. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from one scene to another. It is one of those silent films that continually pays for itself, simple but profound. The dialogue reflects the talk of the character that is not common these days. <br /> <br /> All the acting is magnificent. Even the minor characters like the bar waiter and the street cop are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other perfectly. He was really getting into his stride as an actor and gave a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was an exceptional actor and much appreciated these days. Some of his other films are worth catching. Like Mr. Matuschek, Frank Morgan is incredible. His moment of truth is very moving. All-round golden stars for artists. <br /> <br /> It's a well used phrase that doesn't make them as they used to (the vague remake of "You've Got Mail" was terrible) but in this case it's true. The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode fortunately, but he delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
