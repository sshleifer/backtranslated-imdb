I think I received this film when I was young. I remembered seeing him as a child, but I never managed to find the film. I remembered good old Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Avido, King Koo Koo. I searched up and down for this movie and still no luck. But one day, when I was leaving my childhood home, I found it. We got together. I'm 17 now. I look at him again. Actually all the time. It's one of the most fun and touching films I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes, a real follow-up. Now I'm even thinking about getting the captain bird tattooed somewhere on my body!
