The feeling of this film was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. While playing a very shaken and fragile character, he brought his skill to the limit and really worked on the role. His character was really interesting. I can see the script for this movie myself and I'm not interested in the part as Sandler did to me. For someone who plays mainly comedic roles, he pulled out a serious role with what appeared to be his peculiarities and inputs. I particularly enjoyed the scene where the characters of Adam and Don drove the motorized scooter around the city. I became familiar with the moment, because it seemed that Don was witness to something that Adam does to get away from it all. With his video games, music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, driving his scooter with headphones looks like an escape from his thoughts. This film definitely deserves the watch.
