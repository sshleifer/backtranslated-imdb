I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was totally taken aback by how much I was involved. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the life of a group of people who take an adult swimming course for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, the class acts as a catalyst for more changes in student life. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the film was how real it was. Rarely in the ensemble works are the characters treated so well. I enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely and the drama that took place outside was very intense. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and eventually left a very strong feeling, just like attending school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, make strong ties and make discoveries about yourself, but you have to leave too soon. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that Paula's character had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know more about her than was eventually revealed. I suppose you don't meet everyone in class, even if ... <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I found the film very complete and very enjoyable. Look at it if you have the opportunity.
