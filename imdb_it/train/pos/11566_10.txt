A short subject FROLICS OF YOUTH. <br /> <br /> A teenager, embarrassed by the fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel he finds helps change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a fun little movie, with Shirley Temple stealing all its scenes like the hero's lively little sister. The opening gag - which concerns night-time enuresis - is in bad taste, but is quickly forgotten. Highlights: climatic fist fights, which appear extraordinarily realistic. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, subjects with one and two reels were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or growing talent, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamic for creating a short, successful subject was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a first-class story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and planning and capable of representing a wide range of materials, the short subjects were the perfect complement to the films of the Studios.
