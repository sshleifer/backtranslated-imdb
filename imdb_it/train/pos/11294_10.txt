This film is right. As a former USAF aviation cadet, I can tell you that this film has it all. The boredom of the application process. The word on hold. The joy of welcoming. The concern to succeed during the course. The sadness of watching one's friends (perhaps the best of them) wash themselves. The anguish of paying the highest price - the death of aviators of foiled students. The glory of the degree. Always the flight, the flight, the flight. Many are called but few are chosen. We paid to pay what we paid to do.
