Recently I came across this little gem of a cable movie. It took me by surprise, though, I should have expected it from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this film with a sure hand, and show. We are always amazed at the secret life of the assassins. You don't have to go too far to realize that they are probably your neighbors, or social acquaintances or even friends; they are not different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone for the right price. He has no qualms about teaching his son the ropes, and even his nephew! Alex is a man who lives in turmoil. He knows what he did in the past and suddenly he is coming to realize the consequences of his actions. He must see someone to help him find peace with himself. Going to Dr. Parks, he is trying to find absolution, even if he doesn't find him there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turning point when Alex discovers who should kill the next one. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly played by William H. Macy, fascinates us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe he is that man. One of the best things about the film is the late John Ritter. He is just as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who reveals the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, how grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised her with her key role as Sarah. Show a capacity and range that are incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the ailing wife, and she can't do much. Even Barbara Bain, in a rare aspect, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman, is a delight for the film. It shows a maturity beyond its years. <br /> <br />
