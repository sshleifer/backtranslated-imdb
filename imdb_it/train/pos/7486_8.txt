I first really like this movie for a few reasons why I'm going to be late but I want to touch because I think people don't like it. First of all, there are people out there who love to hate Tom Cruise. I really don't understand it. Second, Cameron Crowe thinks that with this film he managed to drive off two groups of spectators. The group of casual, relaxed spectators, "doesn't seem too hard", get confused when the plot becomes complete at the end of the film. And the profound, philosophical, mystery fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters that completely explains the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a great job. I think it's probably his best performance from what I've seen, even though I haven't seen all of his films, or maybe most of them probably. The supporting cast is also good. Penelope Cruz offers a solid performance and Jason Lee was fun. <br /> <br /> I like the story, and I think it's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything else. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but above all it's a good story. And it has a lot of philosophical subtleties to it, and many similar ideas and stories like this happen in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man who had everything he wanted, more or less lost, had a second chance with a hold to regain everything, and eventually face his demons and the full extent of what is happening, he chooses reality, simplicity and normality to see if he finally manages to find the only thing he could never grasp: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people have been disappointed that Crowe exposed the complete mystery at the end. I think it's necessary. The public then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and makes the choice ultimately even more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the film is fantastic. Probably that's what makes the movie so enjoyable. In particular, "Njosnavelin" by Sigur Ros, which is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would give 3 out of 4 stars. It's a film with a certain substance for those who like to think about things, and a great story for those trying to relax. This "moderate" approach is probably the reason why people don't like it so much because it is not a full-blown mystery or a full-blown love story. Mix and match different elements and genres.
