This is without doubt one of the most entertaining films ever made. Amitabh as a farmer, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is that the laughter never stops. The plot is the same old story, in which the child is separated from the mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are the bad guys (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixen (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember in the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to town to live a decent life and her dialogue and way of being are hilarious. Later in the film he turns into Angry Young Man for whom he is famous, but humor remains. The memorable parts include his way of walking, speaking and speaking English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his nut. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was bursting out laughing at the whole movie. If you want 3 hours of fun with Amitabh at its absolute best, this is it. It will easily give him a 10/10.
