I saw the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is "original". This is a word not much used on TV because everyone tends to copy whatever the other network is doing and end up with seven nights of criminal shows, unpleasant comedies and reality crap. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me as a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British series "Carry On ..." or those who have not heard a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I'll have to tune in more, but it gives the show an atmosphere of "Harry Potter". Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. He never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He collaborates with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", Roll Bounce) to solve the murders with this talent. Everything is beautiful and fun until you come across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things get really complicated. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Guys, this would make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I will tune in to see where this series will go, waiting for it to continue to entertain.
