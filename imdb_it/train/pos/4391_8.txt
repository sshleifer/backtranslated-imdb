You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated Audie Murphy's 3-way movie (I'm a strict recruiter), the second lowest I've ever given to Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this film an "8" rating (and I am a strict recruiter). It is the story of the Civil War of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell and the men who rode with these outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version, very clean, while showing the horror of what these men did. In reality, films like the previous version are best viewed by a mature audience, which can discern the story. I would be more apt to evaluate the original "R" and this, with its harsh nature, a GP, because the most recent film provides a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a young person than the previous version. <Br /> <br /> Filmmakers have boasted of "realism" since the early 1960s, but few of them offer. Instead, they simply give the gray atmosphere, the monotonous costumes and the shocking events, but with stereotyped characters in comic books, the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers have made this mistake. It is evident in a superior Western style that we usually see today. This film is an example. It provides realistic settings, but it also gives us characters that we can believe exist at that time. <br /> <br /> It has some moments of calm, which makes the complete sitting a little harsh, and has some inexplicable situations. But the inexplicable situations are in place until the entire film resists and the characters are quite intriguing. <br /> <br /> Start out a bit in camp, but it really gets better. The main character is what we can identify and at least have some understanding. The character of Audie Murphy from the first film does not evoke sympathy and is too virtuous without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character of this film follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is a motivation and a method for his madness. We never think it's really "right", but we can understand where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the film. There is also humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that she wouldn't lie to him, and mulls over it. <br /> <br /> This film manages to do what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This team of directors and screenwriters got it right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success
