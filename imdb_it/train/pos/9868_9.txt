This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but is different in its less cartohic appearance (despite the deliberately cartoony features of the main creatures). The story is not the one that had an enormous moral in the face at the end (it is more like his pulling on the sleeves of the shirt), but only chooses to tell a story about the relationships between different "animals". You know the result, but you can't help being involved. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are much more than their voices (the advantage of the less famous actors who make the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely credible, oddly enough. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the revelations and oddities of the character are subtle and amusing. You'll be rooting for them much sooner than you'd like to think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will pray for the opportunity to go on the ice in the film. You'll love the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its hazels. I came out wanting the mandatory merchandise, especially the sloth, only to be disappointed the next day when I couldn't find anything vaguely related. <br /> <br /> Which, strangely, makes the film even purer. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
