Two snipers travel deep in the jungle in search of their targets; a slimy South American drug lord and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> Moderately able to create a dark atmosphere, Sniper is largely a very solid thriller, taking his time, establishing his characters and their condition and climaxing in some good action sequences. The director Llosa does not always manage to keep the mood dark and may have strengthened the story a little; some deviations here do not add much. But this film is far better than his Stallion / Stone in disguise The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly boring, surprisingly does the inexperienced Sniper paired with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this film proved to be his last big Hollywood budgeting venture. He can do these kinds of roles in his sleep and is very convincing, resuming the role twice more in the DVD sequels.
