Micro-phonies is a classic short by Stooge. The boys are skilled repairers working at a radio station, and during a few laps in a broadcast booth, Curly's perfect imitation of a recording of "Voices of Spring" is mistaken for the real thing, leading to a radio contract and to a crazy musical party. The fake interpretation of the quintet trio of "Lucia de L'Amamore" is particularly amusing. Undoubtedly this is an essential vision for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although evidence of Curly's lack of health is visible on his face and voice, his performance is surprising, and is probably the last look at old Riccio. Some fans think "A Bird in the Hand" is Curly's last big short, but his rough voice and slow movement are too hard to watch.
