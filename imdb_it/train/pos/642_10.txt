I was dragged into this film about four years ago by a French actress friend. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at Hollywood's New Beverly Theater, hating this movie, hating myself and even hating the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened but I was involved in the film in a way I had never been in years. And this despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and that they had to make every step by hand. I had been in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that great films will pull you into a world, make you part of you and then leave you to talk to your friends for coffee or a drink. This film did it. It was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
