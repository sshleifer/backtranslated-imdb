There is a scene in Dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can end the crossword before. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's law: everything that can go wrong will go wrong. This is exactly the case with Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the office), a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things are not so perfect in his. Dan in Real Life is incredible in capturing these ironies of everyday life and manages to embrace the comedy, the tragedy and the beauty of all. Besides, this movie is damn funny. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife forces Dan to raise her three daughters by herself ... every daughter in her cardinal stages of life: the first is anxious to try her driving license, the central one in her adolescent phase and the younger one that moves away from early childhood. Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and he stumbles upon an intriguing woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid embarrassing situations ... which is exactly what is in store when they are thrown into the Burns family. <br /> <br /> If you saw Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you know that he is incomparable with comic times and with a tremendously dynamic actor. Steve Carell is fantastic at capturing all the emotions that come from family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family and the house itself provide a warm environment for the film that contrasts the inner turmoil that develops throughout the film and eventually explodes in a rather suspenseful climax. The film falls only in some of the predictable results, but at the same time life is made of both irony and predictability: which is an irony in itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing, for the sheer pleasure of watching all the fun subtleties that we often miss in everyday life, and most likely I will enjoy a second time, or also a third. Just "put it in my card".
