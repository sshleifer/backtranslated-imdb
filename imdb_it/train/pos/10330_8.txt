This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maugham's short stories. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is fired from his church job because he can't read or write. So what does it do? He opens a tobacconist, of course! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and immediately forgotten, until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes, and also very good. It worked better in a film than in a book for me, but maybe it's because I was only 14 the last time, after all. <br /> <br /> The third is almost a disappointment. Almost an hour long, it simply drags on. It's not so bad, but not as fast and snappy as the last 2. I looked at the first quarter of an hour and then jumped forward until the last quarter of an hour, and found that it still made sense and really I hadn't lost a thing! <br /> <br /> In general I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively.
