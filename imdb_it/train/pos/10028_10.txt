When I saw this movie I was amazed by what was a great movie. This is the only film that I think can give a 10-star rating. I'm sure this film will always be in my top 5. <br /> <br /> Acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I don't think anyone could get a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, that's it. You will love all the acting, special effects and much more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, rent or buy it now !!! You will not regret. <br /> <br />
