This film is an exact copy of a TV series on the Indian television channel doordarshan, broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" which means balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and more "convincing" Abhay Doel does a good job but does not fit the role of "normal" and "third class" kids (as defined in the film). In fact Shayan Munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have adapted the role of Abhays but Shayan does not have the talent to do it. <br /> <br /> I would suggest looking at the series if it is available. It's the same story with the exception of running around with the mother of friends and the initial introduction. The acting of television actors was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason this film is a flop is because the director tried to lengthen the story by half an hour (or 45 minutes) to 2+ hours. So it has to become draggy. Even the nasal songs that sing sensations fail to compensate. <br /> <br /> This film is suitable for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original TV series. The script and the ending of the serial were much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### The end of the original serial was much stronger than the hero himself threw away the girl, even though he thought she was willing to marry him. HE is aware and tells her that he does not want to be "repaid" and never helped with that intention. The director or script writes somehow failed to capture the original ending of this film. The original ending would have brought tears to the eyes of the girls and would have made the boys nod. The delivery was not right. <br /> <br /> But personally I think this is a pathetic copy. Credit must not be given to the director / screenwriter. The story is amazing and is from one of the famous novel writers in the class of PRemchand munshi. I'm not sure this is the story of first-hand munshi, but many of the other short stories in the series feature some of the stories of munshi and other great Hindi writers.
