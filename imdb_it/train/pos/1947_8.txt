SPOILER. Like other posters, I felt that the finish was a bit abrupt. I wanted to see the crew adapt to life on earth after they returned. I suppose the authors anticipated this problem by "frontally loading" some Voyagers on terrestrial sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all questionable.) I liked the way Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As a fan, we can have our cake and eat it, making sure that Janeway makes the maximum sacrifice and lives. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her old conversing self were bizarre and that she could have cut the line so quickly into the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) took it off.
