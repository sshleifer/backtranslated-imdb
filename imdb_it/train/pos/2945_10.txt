I watched this movie a few times in the 90s and I almost shared the parts laughing every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this situation is something else. He is so funny. Also the P.C. the brigade would find it hilarious. It is a must to look at, and even better if you have boys or girls for a drink. Michael Jackson's take-off is so similar to him, if you close your eyes you think he's the one singing. The things he describes are true to life and you should seriously have a bypass of humor if you thought it wasn't funny. My local video stores no longer keep this video, but I'd like to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and children when they're old enough to appreciate humor. Anyway, highly recommended, I hope you like it.
