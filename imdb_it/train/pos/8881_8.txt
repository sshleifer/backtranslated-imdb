The first must take into account the time period in which this film was made. 1995. The rappers were in, and that added touch. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially embarrassed teenager who tried to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was helped by the Nazis. They took it. The Nazis are not so embarrassing, but like most gangs, they fill a gap that is lacking both economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the star of the hit track, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He continued to feel sorry for himself and his situation, and he had his girlfriend and his professor to straighten him out. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white girl who tried to find herself and try to adapt, until she was raped. Then he found his self-experimentation with his sexuality and became politically involved. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism and like most things about racism, people's perspectives come into play. <br /> <br /> I have read so many comments about how there were no "bad" black characters but there was a wicked white one (Nazis). So? Remy wasn't badly portrayed, he was trying to find his way, and he continued to fail until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him devolve as he had done. He also says just before he killed himself, I didn't mean to do it, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry men, Ice Cube was a bit of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just interpreted as a stupid thug. Both have shown no consideration for their roommates, and in general they do not seem very welcome to whites. They were as angry as the Nazis but not at the level of the Nazis in terms of general malice. Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = -bad black = good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good boy, and even Remy was a good boy, he was just misled. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and reckless. Although their constant police harassment seemed to justify part of their anger. Remy's inability to adapt seemed to justify his anger as well. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all films that deal with racism, it's a great piece to start a discussion. <br /> <br /> I don't think Cube and Busta could beat those Nazis.
