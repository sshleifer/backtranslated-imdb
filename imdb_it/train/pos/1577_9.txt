SPOILERS WITHIN. <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta was much more at ease with what is the balance between personal history and the history of events than it was in his previous film Versprechen, Das (1995). /> <br /> The management seemed carefully controlled, and I visually felt that it was very tempting - especially where visual fiction was concerned (the title sequence fusion and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the death of various characters in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that many people have been confused by: <br /> <br /> Firstly, Lena has not slept with Goebbels. Although this may seem implicit, it was not the intention. Von Trotta told me! (And she really is a good lady, by the way!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the event calendar was indeed historically accurate (actual dates are shown on the first floor of the memorial) and prisoners were released suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence to show that Goebbels was annoyed to have done so and that he had planned to recapture those he had freed. <br /> <br /> Overall, what struck me most was the original story of "over-animated" era. It seems a pity that it took so long (for various reasons) for this film to hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same please, Margarethe!
