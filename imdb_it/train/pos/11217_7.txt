Being an otaku since Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite spirits of all time. Considering when it was realized, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which art diminishes in terms of quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the pleasure of watching the film. Although it has been described as "saccharine", it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males behave. Since the main character is a female, it should be obvious that he does not necessarily need to resort to "macho-man" tactics to gain the respect of his peers. Noriko's seiryuu, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is like a three-dimensional cardboard; his personality captures the essence of a lively girl who seems to be completely helpless but eventually succeeds through the power of his will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked a bit like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a rather questionable "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than having the car wrap a velvety giant cloak on itself in "true Dracula style" style). I doubt the scene was funny, but it annoyed me. And yet, all in all, I would rate Gunbuster in the 20 best anime of all time.
