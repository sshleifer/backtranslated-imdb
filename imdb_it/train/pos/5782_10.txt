The Internet database lists it as a TV program. And yes, it was an MTV series shown in the "Oddities" program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version I saw this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes that ran together in a movie without annoying credits or that had to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a superhero or a tramp, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen less than The Smiths and Mr. Gone, a boy who seems unable to keep his head. And then there are the other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "o" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and what the dreams are. Maybe they are all true or dreams. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Perhaps there is only one and dreams of others. You will have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had comics before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything you will find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and will have strong nuances as an adult without being obscene or offensive. And the show has basically used the exact same work of art (only now it moves) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced. This was the best show to appear on "Oddities", without problems. <br /> <br /> If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mental journey, this is a sight to be verified. It's "Donnie Darko" before there was ever such a thing. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is that this has never become another movie or television series, but I don't say it with disappointment. Keeping it simple, they sealed this film in gold and kept it away from imperfections caused by subsequent failures.
