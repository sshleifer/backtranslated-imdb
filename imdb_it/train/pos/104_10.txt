This film had an interesting cast, it didn't have a cast of list but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have b grade films like this, the story is basic, the actors are basic and as they perform it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of ordinary actors and a list of basic plot. I like the way they got the way for them and there was no one else around and even what's interesting is that they didn't close a bar to fix things and that they did everything from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen have done a great job in portraying roles in the hostage situation. This was a great film and I hope to see more in the near future.
