I liked Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for its poor action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot of the first movie, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a stupid plot with the same super-action to carry it forward. <br /> <br /> This gives the name of the hero of the first film, Alex, to a massed super woman sent to the past to save the future. She grew up from a tribe in Africa. A good part of the film has only dialogues in African language without subtitles, which I liked because it made me a bit authentic (how many times do films like this really try to do it?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to go back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of shit (not that the first was something big). There are subplots covering African political unrest, treasure hunting and tribal combat. The image is very short on the brain, so none of these things get a good treatment. The image is basically a struggle drawn out with some pursuits that are reduced to a comparison between robots and cyborgs. It has its entertainment value, don't just expect quality, or something from the first movie.
