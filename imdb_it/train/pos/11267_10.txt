Robert Wuhl is teaching a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> He covers the errors of history and the truths that are no longer generally known. I would like to see much more of this show. Is very funny. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "shows and tells" to get his points. He explained that the person who led Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name Revere because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I have seen Robert Wuhl for many years, from the time he did cabaret to "Arli $$" in HBO. He's a good actor and a good comedian, but he's an excellent teacher! I highly recommend watching an episode of this show. Worth your time.
