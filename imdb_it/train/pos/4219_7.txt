** SPOILERS ** Since her favorite niece, Phyllis, disappeared into the sea, the murder writer Abigail Mitchell, Ruth Gordon, has strong suspicions that it was Phyllis Edmund Galvin's husband, Charles Frank, who was responsible for his death. In fact, Abigail is convinced she killed her and made him look like a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Knowing that there is no evidence to arrest Edmund for Phyillis's death and decide to take the law in his hands Abigail prepares this elaborate plan to let him in and make it look like the death of Phyllis, a tragic accident. Taking Edmund to come secretly to his villa to give him the combination for his walk-in safe, while he is about to leave on vacation in New York, Abigail forces him to go inside blocking the amazed and surprised Edmund. With the safe being soundproof, nobody at the villa, the butler's maid and Abigail Veronica's personal secretary, Mariette Hartley, hear him shout for help and the next day Edmund is found suffocated to death. Veronica discovered Edmund's body as he was about to put away, to guard it, the last Abigail murder manuscript. <br /> <br /> Lt. Columbo, Peter Falk, is called for the case concerning the strange death of Edmund Garvin to determine whether it is a murder or a tragic accident. Crossing Edmund's apartment, Columbo is puzzled to find out that he doesn't have a photo of his late wife, who's been missing for a month! This is linked to what Abigail always felt about him in Edmund not being in love with Phyllis and also a suspicion about her, in Abigail's mind, about murder. <br /> <br /> Columbo, a big fan, along with his wife, of Abigail's murder novels has difficulty realizing that she was actually responsible for Edmund's death. All the evidence indicates that Abigil included a couple of missing car keys, Edmunds. All this proved that Abgail was actually in the house, not as she headed for the airport, when Edmund was locked inside the safe. <br /> <br /> Passing through all the trials Columbo arrives with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence in the safe in writing to who his killer is. This conclusion is quickly checked when it is discovered that Edmund did not even have a pen or pencil, nor the light, with the safe bulb burned, on him to write it. There is also something very strange that is found in the safe that has been in the mind of Lieutenant Columbo since he arrived on the case. This has to do with the black paint residues that were found under Edmund's nails and on the belt buckle! <br /> <br /> It is that test, when put together with a number of other items in the safe, that ultimately looms the murder of Edmund on the mysterious and astute mystery writer Abigail Mitchell. Edmund let Abigail reveal himself unconsciously in his last attempt as the air in the safe was consumed, by his breathing, using burnt matches to write on the last Abigail manuscript that had murdered him: Abigail Mitchell!
