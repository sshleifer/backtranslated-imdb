Wrestlemania 14 is not often considered as one of the great Wrestlemania but I will insert it personally, in my top 5, if not in the top 3. It has so many great things and it really marked the birth of The Attitude Era, which was The best age of the WWE , in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and he who put on Austin as he did while he was dating was pure class on his part. It has one of the most beautiful crowds you've ever seen, and has J.R and The King at their best! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? team battle royal LOUD pop for the return of L.O.D. I'm not a battle royal fan, and that's another average. Very predictable, even when you see it for the first time, it is obvious that the victory of L.O.D. Watching Sunny for about 8 minutes definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF light heavyweight championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising pop with his entry. Fast, high flight and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would surely have torn the roof, with their belongings. Taka wins with the Michinoku pilot. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, Chyna is handcuffed to Slaughter. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reaction for Trips. A game really, really undervalued, which ranks among my favorites for Wrestlemania, actually. The two mixed very well and Owen can go with anyone. Trips wins, with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed tag game. Marc Mero and Sable Vs Goldust & Luna. Define pop for Sable, unheard of at that time, for women. Sable looks really sexy, and the crowd is just devouring her! The songs of Constant Sable and those that burst almost every time he goes into the ring. Not bad for a game with mixed tags, had funny jokes and had a good time. Sable's team wins when Sable reaches the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before reviewing the game, I'd like to note that The Rock showed its immense potential, with his interview with Jennifer Flowers, before his game. Nice pop for Shamrock, great success for The Rock. Too briefly disappointing, and I thought the ending was rather stupid, though Shamrock's antics were impressive to watch, and the crowd went crazy for it. Rock retains the title when The Ref cancels the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Garbage Match, for the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws are not finished, as they would have been right now. The crowd is actually a bit dead for this, but I thought it had some great Hardcore pieces, with some sick-looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win titles at the end. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane. Big Ovation, for The Undertaker. Much better than what we saw at Wrestlemania 20, and for a great man against a great man, this was really good. It was a great all-out brawl, with The Undertaker taking a sick-looking protest across the table. The WWE was intelligent, making Kane look strong, even through defeat. After 2 kicks of headstones, Taker finally puts him out with a third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs. Steve Austin. Great warmth for Tyson. The crowd goes for Austin, surely one of the biggest pop I've ever heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. This is really a special match up, one of the biggest wrestlemania events in history, you can understand when J.R is still out of breath. HBK gives the maximum, in what was to be his last match, and Austin was rarely better. The animosity and electricity of the crowd are incredible, and it's so exciting. Austin wins with the stunner, with Tyson joining at 3:16 am eliminating Michaels. Austin's celebratory victory, it's a wonder to see, with one of the sexiest crowds you've ever seen, King said well, they were going crazy. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and it really started the Attitude Age. This is very special for me, because it was the first Wrestlemania I've ever seen, back in 98. "The Era of Austin has begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
