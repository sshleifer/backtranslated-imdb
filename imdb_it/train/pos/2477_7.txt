Great epic as it is, Kenneth Branagh's monumental interpretation of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy is affected by the weight of his four hours of play and certainly requires real stamina. Two completely separate sessions would probably be better to fully appreciate what is certainly a high-class film. While I absolutely recognize this masterpiece as such, I must confess the lack of enthusiasm for the showiness of the old bards, its rhetoric (and it recovers so well) and its many flourishes. Thus "Hamlet" loses its impact as it loses its hold. <br /> <br /> From the music of Patrick Doyle to the cinematography of Alex Thomson to the exquisite sets by Tim Harvey, the film is a feast of visual and sound delights, which compliments a fine cast. Branagh has hired three huge cloaks, adapting, directing and playing. His adaptation is superb, his direction is strong, but when he came to the role of Hamlet, the tension seemed to show; yet it still does a great job in what is an incredibly tiring role. Derek Jacobi gobbles up the left Claudio with joy, and Julie Christie is the most dramatic of her queen, Gertrude. Richard Briers is as wonderful as Polonius, and Charlton Heston is once again a strong influence on the screen as the king of the player. Many others pass by, including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. However, the acting award must go to one of the great theatrical discoveries of recent years, Kate Winslet. His is a moving representation of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, Ophelia. <br /> <br /> Finally (before this review goes on longer than the film), I must say that it is the length that really puts the viewer to the test in this film. Branagh directed with the purpose, giving many important and impactful scenes. Too many of them survive their welcome. Watching this movie contains a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have drawn from it. "Neither a creditor nor a borrower be" or "Be true to yourself". And of course: "To be or not to be". <br /> <br /> The first two hours of opening require some perseverance, but if you can stay tuned you will be sure to be treated for an exciting ending that will gather momentum from the tragic funeral onwards. <br /> <br /> Monday 8 June 1998 - Hoyts Croydon
