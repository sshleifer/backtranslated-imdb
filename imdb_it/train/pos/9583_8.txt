I waited a while to publish a review of this documentary because when I saw it for the first time over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I have found from a documentary point of view that this is a good documentary worthy. He did what he set out to do, show me something I had no idea and kept me interested in this world he explored. I didn't know anything about the Drag world and find out and the "Balls" were simply spectacular for me. These people were so talented with what they do and how they do it, for the competition. The catteries, the lamenters (I was also angry when someone told the judge that the coat Drag Queen wore was not a men's coat!), The jealous, it's all there like in any other competition. LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION LIKE. What I felt was a point. <br /> <br /> You had the oldest drag queen who talked about how the "used" balls were compared to the new drag queens that changed the balls and made more competition categories - and even those who watched him knowing that the future of Balls would have changed even more when they were ready to walk on the catwalk. It was interesting to hear that some of the competitors were living on the street two minutes before the ball, but they came to compete, it was so important for them! Then there were sad stories, stories of who "home" and "mother house" brought out the best and the brightest in the race. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now I add after 10 years of watching this film, I experienced the so-called "Madonna" mania. I noticed some familiar faces in this documentary that ended with Madonna during her "Vogue" phase and rightly so. If it weren't for those people, Madonna wouldn't have had a "Vogue" phase, I know now. Credit should be given where the credit is TWO. It makes me think, if someone else from traditional America would watch this documentary, they will learn that they are not "mainstream" as they think.
