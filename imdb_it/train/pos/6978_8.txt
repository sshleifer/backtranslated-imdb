Well, I have to say I waited for it to arrive. <br /> <br /> I will not try to ruin it and many people have really spoken brilliantly about the pilot. On the other hand I'm not quite sure I understand the detractors who claim to be BSG fans and not the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did they expect? The scenario is set 50 years before BSG witnessed the birth of the Cylons, seeing the life of the Adama family (we have already known some of them from BSG), obtaining a deeper explanation of the Capriciana population and its perception of the other colonies, and potentially the origins of the divine belief of the human and the only divine belief of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I don't expect the same profusion of special effects or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two even though I know Caprica will reinforce BSG. <br /> <br /> This is a promising 1h30 start, I also believe that this will put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as BSG's. I expect a lot from the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watching the deleted scene on the DVD also gives you more material for your chewing brain. <br /> <br /> Waiting for January 2010
