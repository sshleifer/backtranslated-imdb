It was such a joy to have looked at this intriguing project. So refreshing and educating. Not just for a director, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes on screen, but also as an audience, who may not be so ready for so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> short 20 love films in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought that the Tom Tykwer segment (Natalie Portman) was the best, even if the mimes made me smile in the same way. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoiler" option for this review bus alas ... what to read is quite a spoiler. Just watch it Don't read what I write, but instead watch the film. <br /> <br /> And smile.
