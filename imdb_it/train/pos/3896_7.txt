Some people loved "The aristocrats" and others hated him, often going out in the middle. It is not likely that the reactions to Eddie Izzard are so extreme - if you can handle a disguised comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that does, we should say, use the word "f" enough that his program it would be a long beep if presented on the television network. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaw in his performances. On the other hand, I thought that this show was sometimes flatter than Izzard's chest, but also more often than amusing and, at times, absolutely hilarious. It has a way of linking references from routines to the beginning of the show to its subsequent routines. He is not a narrator. He is not a joke maker. He is not a frenetic playmaker like Robin Williams. Play with ideas, some of which work and some of which - a routine with the San Francisco and Alcatraz cable cars, for example - are completely unattractive. However, he has a way of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending those that connect. I gave this performance at 7 and could be persuaded to take it to an 8. But a 10? There's no way.
