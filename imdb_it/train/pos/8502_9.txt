Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is in charge of courting a Japanese automobile company to come to his city and create jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens next is one hilarious moment after another. The two cultures collide and it's up to Keaton to hold things together. Look for great shows from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly expressed. Don't be fooled by the low number of votes. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of the town of Hadleyville was also used at noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
