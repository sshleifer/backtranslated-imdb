This is the true story of an Australian couple who is accused of murder when their child disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to keep our interest even if she plays a character that is not particularly nice. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy surrounding this case in Australia is reminiscent of the Sam Sheppard case of murder in Ohio during the 1950s. These real-life situations show that the media can actually influence the way a criminal case is handled. I well remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer that advertised a huge title that read "Why is Sam Sam not in prison?" Eventually the prosecutor succumbed to this incessant pressure and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in prison was he exonerated. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a true story, they do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good films that tell the story of innocent people accused of crimes include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
