Exhilarating does not begin to describe this kind of real force tour-de-Star-Wars (Luke: how strong is Vader: the strength of a small pony), in which, being the master he is, he does not even break the sweat, ingeniously saving the loss of mascara ... and this is with almost 2 hours of whirling through history, its birthplace, Europe and more. <br /> <br /> From Heimlich in the middle of the night, "I invented a maneuver!" to the British Empire "... do you have a flag ..?" and ancient of the dead, "Jeff! The God of Biscuits!" and many others, this is the fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jump -art-your-lungs fun. <br /> <br /> And I confess to having broadcast this video dozens of times over the years, seeing how a British horseman standing in a chair is a long sight of a rental after all, especially one that dates back 10 years. Still, the material is not only timeless, but almost original, transforming the present into nothing more than an amplified, more amusing / sad version of where we were a decade ago, although if you think about it, it might just be a coincidence.
