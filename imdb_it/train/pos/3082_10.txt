What is really sad, shows like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are the real TV reality, not that garbage that is nothing but glorified game shows. I think there has been a swelling of discontent in recent years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following. But with the most vocal backlash of Jericho fans (which I also like) and other shows, networks could begin to reverse this trend. They are like the others, I will NOT support ANY new show until they have had a second season. I will therefore make a decision to watch and retrieve via DVD and online viewing. Until then ABC, you lost me as a spectator of ANY new show.
