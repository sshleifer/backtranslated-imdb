Currently the new program of METOO at 16:00 on weekdays, immediately after "Maverick" and immediately before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I don't know if I've ever actually seen an episode when it was originally active, but I'm really fascinated. Unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical West. Genre of "Naked City" by Western. <br /> <br /> And the guest stars are: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a Mexican traitor), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (like a Mexican color), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I Married a Monster from Outer Space") <br /> <br /> It worked for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January 1959, to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as head of the Gil Favor trails, the most stolid man who ever lived, with the code d honor of a samurai, and the right balance between tenacity and openness. I would vote for him for the president every day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And a young Clint Eastwood is rather surprising as his impulsive right hand, "Rowdy" Yates . In addition, veteran western actor and country music character (the immortal "One-eyed, One-horned, Flying Purple People Eater") Sheb Wooley is there like Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes a chef's most irascible character you could ask for as a "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> And then there's a great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between this and the "Maverick" theme, I have Western-themed songs that run through my head all day.) <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to every episode; I'm collecting the entire set. A good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will have their difficulties straightened before the spot. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin', rollin '...."
