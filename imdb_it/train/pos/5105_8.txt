How can anyone argue that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best document of Texas life for that period. Consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk in bars every night, get married to solve a quarrel, commit adultery and compete on mechanical bulls. Try to name a film that describes real life so vividly. They don't make them anymore. It seems that current films are always about people with a lot of money, they live in huge houses, they drive expensive cars and they don't work. This film has a celebratory scene on how to get a trailer for heaven's sake! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watch it at least once a week. I'm not kidding. I have dissected this film from one end to the other. do not hesitate to write me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are divided - he melts and greets friendly, she spins his bird - returns half of the peace sign that sounds the horn to add impact and then rips. <br /> <br /> Buds' mother calls him approx. 18 hours after he arrived in the city, on Sunday, to see if he still has a job - all he accomplished is getting drunk and settling down (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt who look after him. <br /> <br /> "Live all like pigs" Think why this scene is necessary. Think about it. It was necessary? Couldn't we figure that out without showing the grimy sink? God love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes just kicked her husband. Steve asks: Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yeah, you didn't beat my husband the other night, so let's take this lesson, not to mention the fact that she seeks comfort in him later during the numerous fights between Bud and Sissy, which are all happening in public - in Gilley's! <br /> <br /> The wedding reception photo session (oh humanity!) could at least organize or move the chairs out of the way. "My legs are a real mother" <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we don't put scenes like that in a movie to try to show the understanding of human psychology. It's a real life documentary. I just wish there was a directorial cut.
