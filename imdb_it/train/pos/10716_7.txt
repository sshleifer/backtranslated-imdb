I'm watching this on the Star World network abroad that buys American and Canadian series that last one or two seasons like The Jane Show. I thought about how many of the main female comedies are able to look alone, there's Lucy, bewitched, I dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind becomes almost empty I can't think of anyone else, women all have non-commanding support roles. So for me, The Jane Show is in good company. One thing I thought of. I saw several things done in Canada, and I never remember anything of what was filmed in a regular TV series showing SNOW! It's all done in the middle of summer, LOL! Sure, it's a great place to experience the weather in the summer, but you THINK, they'd show a little bit of Canada in the winter as it's part of the lifestyle there too. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs comes to mind as two comedies that have lasted for a long time shot in Canada and very little or no shots were taken in the snow, although they both do a lot of outdoor shots. I digress but giggles at Jane and her clearly liberal ways accused of racism towards her neighbor, and I like the bald and her madness, I found her on par with a UK series called The IT Crowd (I Think ) another office comedy with a female lead. It is certainly not the best comedy of all time, but for a guy to say he can watch it for himself, this is something he says. If I were with my wife, I might really like her because she faces office sex and stuff like that so it could be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 of 10.
