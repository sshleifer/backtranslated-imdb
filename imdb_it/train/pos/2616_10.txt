The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very nice story to follow with The Lion King. It basically follows the original story of The Lion King but with a couple of twists. In the film, the vents are explained from a different point of view of the characters. This story is still an original storyline. <br /> <br /> As for the sequels, Disney is not that good at making them good. This, being the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second), actually has an original idea while still involving the fun of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel together looking for the ideal place to live. After searching far and wide, they find the place of "Hakuna Matata". Then they meet a little lion named Simba, and they go through many things that parents go through today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a great movie, and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
