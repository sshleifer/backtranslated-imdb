The title of this film does not make much sense, until you see it in operation, because it is the sound that makes a young retarded while he is maneuvering his imaginary trolley, which is what he does all day. And it's just one of many strange characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunks who trade wives, there is a man with aspirations to be an architect and his young son who sends to beg for food. There is an old sage who seems to be the mainstay of sanity in everything that happens around him, and there is a businessman with some serious tic disorder who has a wife who treats him (and everyone else) like dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no particular storyline for this, really, it's a bunch of stories that move back and forth between them, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all I thought it worked quite well, and I was dying to see it for a long time based on its description. I was not in the least disappointed, and I would certainly recommend it. 9 out of 10.
