I must admit that for the first half hour of this film I was practically lost. There was a slightly amusing humor, but at best a shameless plot and a general sense of worthlessness that was making me think I was wasting my time. So, for no apparent reason, I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this. There was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene grabbed me. In fact, nothing very exciting happens in the whole film. It was as if suddenly I realized that the film should have been largely useless - and that in its own uselessness it was its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman acted as an unnamed actor who finds a "small project" to restart his career. He will play a supermarket manager and spend the day in a neighborhood supermarket looking for the role. While meeting and bonding with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more from life. He helps her prepare for a job interview as if she were doing auditions for a role, while she introduces him to real life. It's really fun to watch "him" (because that's how the character is identified in the credits) being overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega have been great together, with a strange but completely credible kind of romantic but father-daughter combined chemistry. If you feel lost in the beginning, continue with this. In the end, it turns out to be a delightfully charming film. 7/10
