In 2006, AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative wildlife documentaries in the coldest place on Earth, the film was March of the Penguins, narrated by Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now. They took their stabs at making live action movies and it was perfect for everyone. Disney then created a sub-division called Disneynature and released his first feature called Earth. This is absolutely one of the most touching and instructive documentaries I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> Narrated by the great James Earl Jones, Earth offers nothing new to anyone who has seen the Discovery Channel in the last five years or follows the global warming crisis closely. Earth touches the problem very deeply and takes a very liberal approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> It allows an emotional connection with nature that I have never experienced before. It also shows not only the beautiful and mystifying parts of our beautiful planet, but also the grunts and disturbing aspects that it often entails. It is one thing to watch "Mufasa" fall from a cliff in a stampede or Bambi's mother be killed by a hunter in the woods. It's all right because at the end of the film we know it's a movie. This shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all types of families, from all walks of life, who live and die in their natural habitats. These real things make a real cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Although a little heavy on the graphic nature of the film (which many people will disagree with), Earth is a moving experience. There is a breathtaking film work here from an excellent camera team and an incredible soundtrack by George Fenton. In comparison to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, it actually doesn't hold any measure, but stands out on its own. At the end of the day, grow an appreciation of our planet and a little bit of sadness, as many of us will probably never be able to visit these places that we will see in the film. We live here, but it's as if we've never explored the planet for one reason or another. The Earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
