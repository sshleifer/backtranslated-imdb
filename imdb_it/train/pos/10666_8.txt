When I started really interested in movies, at the age of eleven, I had a great list of films to "see" and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three at the weekend; some of them weren't for all audiences and my mother would have gone mad. I remember that one of the films on that list was "A Chorus Line" and he could never understand it; so now to see it is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost the list and would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to see there. I mean, take "A Chorus Line", a theatrical performance turned into a movie. I know it's something we see a lot nowadays, but at the time it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicals have made films today, take the opportunity that the machine gave them for free, to create different scenarios and bring the characters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born on a theatrical stage like a comedy and dies in the same place as a movie. After a great audition held by the well-known choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs a large number of dancers as they try to get the job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition among the dancers? And it all happens on stage, where Douglas puts every dancer in the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal lives and their most horrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they get shorter when the hours pass. <br /> <br /> Like a movie I saw recently, "A Prairie Home Companion", the broadcast of a radio program, Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. On stage or behind the stage, things are going and time does not seem to stop. Again, I don't do it if Atenborough has cut a lot to shoot this, but it certainly doesn't look like it; and in any case it is an excellent work of directing and editing (John Bloom). But in that little stage, what you ask yourself is what to do with the camera? With just one setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds its way, taking close-up shots to certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the stage from a different perspective and also giving us a nice view of New York. <br /> <br /> At a crucial moment, Douglas tells those who have remained: "Before starting to eliminate: you are all fantastic and I would like to take everything, but I cannot". This made me think of today's reality shows, where the only thing that matters is the talent of singing or dancing and where the jury always says the exact words to the competitors before some of them leave (even when they are not good ). It's hard, you have to imagine it; at least here, where everyone is really fantastic. <br /> <br /> To tell a few stories, the characters use the songs and, in a second, the stage takes on a new life and literally is a dream come true ". Marvin Hamlisch's music and Edward Kleban's words make theater a flawless film transition, showing the feelings of these dancers and making them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes an impeccable and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman; which is sometimes very touching. So if it's not with a song it will be with a word; but in "A Chorus Line", it is impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During one of the audition breaks, Cassie, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed, takes the stage to convince the Douglas character that she can do it. The words "let me dance for you" have never seemed more honest and wonderfully set to music and lyrics.
