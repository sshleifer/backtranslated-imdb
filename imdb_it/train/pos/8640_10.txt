This movie is fantastic! Brad Pitt will never be able to play the performance he gave in this film. Duchovny was first rate, as were Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a panoramic road tour of historical murder sites, in one of the most beautiful cars ever made, the Lincoln Continental of the 60s. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He loves his women not to curse or smoke, and to wear PWT clothes. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are the trailerers of Trailer from the rural outskirts. Although the majority tone of the film is obscure, there are a lot of fun scenes to have. Writing, directing and acting are brilliant. If you like street movies, murder, humor and storytelling, watch this movie. Everyone offers and will want more when the credits arrive. One of my all-time favorites. "Hey ... shave that dog and teach it to hunt!"
