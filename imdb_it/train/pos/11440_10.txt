I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today. It's the second time in two days and yes, I see the films I like as often as necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the brilliance of the images and by the works of Goldsworthy. This morning when I threw the coins I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity for water, hence the title. I received the fifth change of line which changed to # 7 The Army. For Blake Art it was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to review the movie. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few existing SF Examiner reviews online. The critic adored the film but said that Goldsworthy's comments hampered his enjoyment of the film. He would prefer to have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack. So I realized this while watching this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well today I could go a bit further than the images and listen to what he has to say. Could I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he is doing, what he is saying goes far beyond "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Changes and so on made me think that man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his works / words are Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> However, the film is only (apparently) shown here in the Bay Area. Become a trend setter. Go to your local cinema and tell them, don't insist that they have to book a movie you've heard about from the hinterland. It's called Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br />
