The era of the film sexploitation of the late sixties and early seventies began with the use of free nudity in traditional films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. They are peak years between 1968 and 1972. One of the most loved and talented actresses of the time was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult of followers. Actually he was able to act, unlike many who filled the main roles of these films, and his subsequent credits proved it. And his seemingly intentional fading into obscurity just as his career was taking off only enhances his charm. <br /> <br /> Even Gary Graver, the director, was a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with Monica Gayle's stage presence, makes Sandra, the Making of a Woman, a pleasantly pleasant experience. The film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast forward button.
