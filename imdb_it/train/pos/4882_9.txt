It's a fun affair, reviewing movies. In these days when "internalized emotions" and "emotional detachment" are favored over simple sentimentality, it must be difficult to remain true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after completing the tasks of the jury at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to take Yoji Yamada's Kabei. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I watched people fantastically come out of the theater room, with watery eyes, men, women and reviewers alike. Even the director of the Berlinale, obviously an indignant movie watcher, confessed to being caught by surprise and found himself crying three-quarters in this shamelessly sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me are the reviews that came next. Although they have been moved in an unjustified way by the film, many reviewers have chosen to be lukewarm and emotionally uncomplicated in their writing. Apparently, after crying, they had put their "thinking hood", and as a result, lost what I felt was the genius of Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Set in pre-war Japan, the story of Kabei revolves around a writer's family and their destiny, after he was imprisoned for what have been described as "thought crimes" against the imperial will . Through a series of protracted emotional scenes, Yamada makes us familiar with the man, his faithful wife and two daughters, as well as three side characters: that man's pretty little sister, an unconscious ex-student and a cad of one uncle? ? everyone comes to help the family cope with their situation, in the absence of the man of the house. <br /> <br /> History moves slowly, albeit with a steady rhythm, and heartbreak occurs precisely at times when everyone is able to foresee. This obviously makes it almost impossible for anyone in the audience to be emotionally upset by any dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, even if you learn to love your family and your helpers, and sympathize with their unfortunate situation, you are so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending. <br /> <br /> However, two hours in the film (don't worry, Yamada provides the viewer with enough gravity and lightness to accompany you), slaps you with what I can only describe as "the sting". All that you supposed to be what the story was about an innocent man snatched from his faithful wife and daughters ?? now he suddenly points to one of the family's helpers. Someone you've taken for granted so far is now thrown into an unexpected turn of fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, something curious happened in the theater where I was. Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition. /> <br /> "My word!" I muttered under my breath. It struck me then that "Kabei" was ultimately more of a film about a family torn by an empire on the brink of war. It was, in effect, an astute examination of a common human weakness: how little we cared about the secret feelings of the people who are closest to us. <br /> <br /> Now, the most common criticism made of the film was that it was technically solid but lacked innovation. This is what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial reflection hat, I guess. With Kabei, I believe Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he should have used to touch a unique aspect of humanity. An old evil trick that he applied without problems in the Tora-san series, and later, in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After having rocked the audience in a sort of narrative comfort zone, it throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the most effective cinematographic tool of all. One that avoids detection but hits you deeply. And the proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, thrown into a dustbin just outside that thousand-seat movie theater. <br /> <br /> Now, if only a few reviewers would have resisted being so engrossed in being intelligent that they forget what the cinema really is. Human emotions Pure and simple.
