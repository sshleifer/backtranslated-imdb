I didn't have too much interest in watching The Flock. Andrew Lau co-directed the trilogy of Infernal Affairs masterpieces, but he was fired from The Flock and was replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. made a good film but had not satisfied the studio, so they fired him and hired another director. It usually doesn't work well (remember The Invasion). But The Flock turned out to be better than I expected. It's not a great film but it's an interesting and fun thriller. The character development is very well done and I could know the characters very well. Furthermore, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent services. Now let's go to the negative points. One element that bothered me (there was a moment when it irritated me) was the excess of tricks of the edition to give the film more "attitude" and style. Their presence is arbitrary. I think the film should have been more ambitious. Nevertheless, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not at all memorable, but it's fun.
