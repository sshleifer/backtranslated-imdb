The life and time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard, as produced and directed by Little Richard, was almost as one-sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but it has good writing, great energy and an exceptional main actor who plays Richard. All the music is from Little Richard, so it plays a synchronous close on each song. <br /> <br /> The film covers his early childhood, loved ones through the formative years of music, wild success and Richard is throwing it all away praising the Lord. Everything is well connected and the obvious return in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, who opened it. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his outrageous counter-cultural behavior is undervalued and you have no idea how his audience lived it at the time. Part of his energy, which he still has, does not reach full strength. He looked tame, compared to what I remember him at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are those that Richard gets jolted by Lucille and write a song about it and the strip of bikini shorts as she performs, to make it aim to have no decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they had entered the "Bronze Liberation" as Richard uses to refer to himself in interviews, then there is a story. Trust me, I've seen him perform a couple of months ago and he continues to flirt with handsome white boys, giving his only hair band to the particularly good dancer of the audience. Almost 68 and still strong, I recommend this film and any concert or appearance T.V. Little Richard is always on
