Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood because it lacks the values ​​of "social commentary" that many films of the day (1969) required of success. <br /> <br /> The characters are satirical of ordinary people and are interpreted for the same purpose by all the actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines particularly brightly like Lord Foppington, a nobleman with hair too big to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the usual things of the eighteenth century; wrong identities, foiled novels, corrupt government officials beaten at every turn. <br /> <br /> Answers the questions: what happens when 4 rowdy, eager to celebrate sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town? And with whom are they involved and how is it solved? <br /> <br /> Despite playing badly at the box office, it has great costumes, excellent music (based on the Mermaid Theater musical of the same name), a fantastic and lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> The fact that it was never released on VHS or DVD is really a shame, as so many bad movies are released every day.
