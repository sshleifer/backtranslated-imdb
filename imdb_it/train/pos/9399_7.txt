This is a film I saw when it first came out and I saw it a few times over the years. It is always pleasant. <br /> <br /> It is one thing that the comedy does not take sides: it evenly taps the work and the capitalists. Only Sid seems out of the classic fight, even if he is responsible. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: don't read further if you haven't seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, even if presented quite plausibly. Ask yourself: could anyone support most of their weight in a single strand of fabric? It could cut almost any support. <br /> <br /> Also, when cornered in an alley, Sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield. Sympathetic symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day, I'll get it on DVD.
