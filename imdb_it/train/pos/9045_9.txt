There is a bit of curiosity that should be pointed out on a scene at the beginning of the film in which Homer looks at the December 6, 1957 attempt (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) that showed the launch attempt of Vangard, which did not work. <br /> <br /> Then it is shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun who offers condolences for failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was at the Marshall space flight center in Huntsville for the army. The Vanguard project was of the first NASA team that was in what soon became the Goddard Space flight center. <br /> <br /> The army rushed to the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a V2 technology made in the United States, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake may have actually been made by Homer, due to Von Braun's notoriety, but his team did not fail his attempt. In fact, the underlying Redstone was flying at 52 and was the first US booster to be used for Shepard's suborbital flight, in addition to Grissom's. <br /> <br /> This is why this type of film is so good, as it is hoped that it will inspire people to read and identify these bits of curiosity, and in the process see what has been done and be inspired to do more .
