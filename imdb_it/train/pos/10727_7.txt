This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not full of failed arms and legs, free violence and enough curses to fill the New York phone book. This film is none of those. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. He doesn't ask you to think, he doesn't require you to accept the film as reality. It simply does what a good movie should do, which is to voluntarily suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The cast is good, though not excellent. As another commentator pointed out, John Williams' sound score was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that much of the film was shot in Huntsville in the real field made it even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the film was postponed for several months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played an important role in its original theatrical opening, but the film eventually it has helped to focus the dreams of many young people towards the space and the possibilities there are. So relax with your children and get ready to have fun.
