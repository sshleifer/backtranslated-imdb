I knew of this as a program similar to that of Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it's the same, only more extreme. Basically, three Welsh and one British madman have been brought together for the sake of skateboarding and a complete disdain / masochism to harm themselves and their health and safety. They vomited, ate pizzas covered with pubis, jumping in stinging nettles, balling of bare paint, jokes about the smaller boy while he slept heavily / snoring, stunts in a workplace, eg. army, cowboys and many more crazy acrobatics that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, perhaps not only for themselves. Played by Matthew Pritchard, who does just about anything, even Lee Dainton does almost nothing, Dan Joyce (the British) who hardly does many physical things and has an OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was something about the 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!
