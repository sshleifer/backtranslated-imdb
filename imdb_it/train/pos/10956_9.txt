For those who think it is strictly humor and immaturity, you are actually the mindless ones. While the show contains its share of vast jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and funny jokes about social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. You just need to read some of his material a little more to get it. <br /> <br /> What I also love is that not everything is a final joke. For those who expect a joke formulated as Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you won't find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her more realistic humor. We don't go around in this world and we have jokes about everything said, which is in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this regard. <br /> <br /> So don't take it as a mindless humor because it's so much more than that.
