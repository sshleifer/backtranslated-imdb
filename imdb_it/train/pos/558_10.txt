Classic drama / western action with an incredible cinematography that is far ahead of time (1954). The production is very good and it can be said that it was made with pride and love. Unique peeking into the pioneers of the American NORTHT WEST is very informative and fun. This film is much under evaluated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "lawmen" at this particular time and place were very corrupt / very corrupt like most developing countries. Action sequences could have been more realistic, but still, this film really covers most of the essentials. Not for an audience that only wants pure western type testosterone for this film is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
