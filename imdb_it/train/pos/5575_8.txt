I didn't expect much from this, but I have to admit that I was rolling on the floor laughing a few times during this movie. If you are not seriously offended in the first ten minutes, this could be a movie for you. Ditto if you are the type who would like to watch Amanda Peet shuffle the cards for an hour and a half. It is certainly not a work of comedy of great importance, but given the genius of the low budget indy this is masterful. To level the playing field for comparison, imagine all the films in the studio with their budgets reduced by a factor of around 100 and watch what you get! Congratulations to Peter Cohen and his network for seeing him. I look forward to your next engagement.
