My family has seen Arthur Bach stumble and stutter since the movie came out. We have memorized most of the lines. I looked at it two weeks ago and am still tickled by the simple humor and life point of view that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a great job as a side kick, even though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie just makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his girlfriend's house. His conversation with Susan and the butler is spitting to the side. The phrase from the butler, "You would expect to wait in the library" followed by Arthur's answer, "Yes, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny stuff "!
