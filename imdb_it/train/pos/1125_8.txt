Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but surprisingly few titles for his name, including some real bullies like the sordid Cold War satire The Day the Fish Came Out. Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the Euripides drama, it is a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and has recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States thanks to Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale but is definitely not a "big" film, with the emphasis on simple history: in supplication to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), to the great consternation of Queen Clitennastra (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both exceptional, but it is the extraordinary Papamoschou that brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the awareness of being the pawn in a political game. Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema.
