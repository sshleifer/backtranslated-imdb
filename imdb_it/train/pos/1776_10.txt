I hated the first episode of this show ('Protesting Hippies') so much in 1999 that I avoided the rest. However, when it came out on "The Paramount Comedy Channel" I watched it in its entirety and, to my surprise, I found it absolutely hilarious (Motto: never judge a comedy series in its first week)! <br /> <br /> Set in 1969, "Hippies" plays Simon Pegg as "Ray Purbbs", editor of an underground magazine "Oz" called "Bocca". His friends are the feminist Jill, the relaxed Alex, and the Hugo humor. Towards the end of the 1960s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people, who could change the world through the printing of magazines that nobody read. Rather than mocking the naivety of the hippies, the 'Hippies' are affectionate towards them. Arthur Mathews' screenplays brazenly parodies a number of icons from that era - "Hair", "Woodstock", "The Graduate", even the infamous "Oz" obscenity process of the early 1970s. Excellent performances by the cast; "Alex" by Julian Rhind-Tutt strangely reminded me of Richard O'Sullivan's "Man About The House" character. It is a pity that there has never been a second series, perhaps because of people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', try it. Once you've passed the bulldozer, you're ready for a surprise!
