Once when I was in college and had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet era poster that said "Ne boltay!", Which means "Don't gossip!". I "translated" it for the "generation" of television observers like "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the nosy neighbor in "Strega"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of the gossip in Snafu's Short "Short" Pvt, you see that it's not funny enough. In this case, the perennially piercing soldier listens to something about the bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis powers attacked the United States. So, he tells someone, who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and continues. As in "The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming", the story gets more and more disproportionate every time, so when it returns to Snafu ... well, you understand what I mean! Yes, it's mostly WWII propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I have to say Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually pretty funny. Of course, given that they had written Dr. Seuss and Mel Blanc who provided the voices, it's no surprise that they came out quite interesting. Worth seeing.
