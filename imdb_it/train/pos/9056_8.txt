So we compromised. This was a pretty fascinating film, I liked the art direction (felt much more "real" than many children's films), and the costumes weren't too cute. The child actors weren't bad enough to watch (adult performances tended towards cheese). It was nice to show how a bullied child bullies others and children who oppose bullying. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many adults would like to see for themselves, but it's a great movie to bring a child to. And since "Barnyard" was apparently frequented by more than 100 children at the same time, I'm really glad that we instead chose the scattered presentation of "worms".
