"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and was simple and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a movie of origin, and if you want dramatic lighting, you see something else. And it's not a tear-jerk at all. But I mean that in a positive way. It shows two men who love each other and being affected by AIDS is affecting the quality of their daily lives. It is almost difficult for me to say if it was a quality film or not, because he was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to respond. It is an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable and sincere documents I have ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity because their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. Makes Hollow-wood productions on AIDS look hip and heartless. These men made this film for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to Mark and says goodbye is the real thing.
