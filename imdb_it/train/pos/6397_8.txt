I gave an 8 star rating. The story may have fallen about 3/4 of the way the image has remained, but the interpretations have remained strong. "Men of Honor" has been changed from "Navy Diver" in an understandable way. Anyone who has served in some branch of the military will probably feel that "Honor" is an appropriate word to use in the title.
