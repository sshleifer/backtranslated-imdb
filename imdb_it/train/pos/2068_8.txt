1958. The sleepy southern town of Clarksburg. Bad Sheriff Roy Childress (the all-powerful Vic Morrow in a mood in a bad mood) crashes hard on speeders forcing offenders off a cliff to their premature deaths on a particularly dangerous stretch of the road. Childress meets his game when hot young driver Rod Michael McCord (a beautifully soft and brooding portrait of Martin Sheen) shows up in the city in his make-up car with the specific intention of avenging his brother's death (the royal brother of Sheen Joe Estevez in a short cameo). Director Richard T. Heffron, working from a tense and intriguing script by Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the drive-in gems of the 70s "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), tells the compelling story in a lively rhythm, neatly creates a 50s-style setting from the 40s and cleverly leaves a lot of suspense in the tense game of wit and will between Childress and McCord. The uniformly refined cast helps a lot: Sheen radiates a distinct rebellious atmosphere of James Deanesque in the first place, Morrow gets the most out of his good boy side, and there are excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as sweet maid Maggie, Stuart Margolin like a mad deputy, Nick Nolte in the role of the amiable gas station attendant Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as stepbrother Lyle of Buzz, Janit Baldwin as the cheeky local Sissy, Britt Leach as taxi driver Johnny and Frederic Downs in clothes of the severe Judge JA Hooker. The motoristic climate clash between Childress and McCord is a truly thrilling heartbeat. The clear cinematography of Terry K. Meade, the well-designed characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with speeding aggression after his wife and son were killed in a fatal fatal accident), the syncopated soundtrack of Luchi De Jesus, and the beautiful mountain landscape further enhances the overall sound quality of this excellent TV series winner.
