Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it would be a stupid and childish film, and indeed it wasn't. it was so incredibly fun for EVERYONE, adults and children. I saw it once because it was almost out of theaters, and now it's FINALLY released on DVD this Tuesday and I'm very excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you haven't already, it was great! <br /> <br /> Liz
