This is simply the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Bad acting, bad script, bad script, bad morals, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself rolling with laughter. <br /> <br /> So you won't win an Oscar but if you "have beer and friends around, then you can't go wrong.
