Simply the funniest and most brilliant cinematographic comedy of all time ... it is certainly in my personal top ten ranking. This also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. The millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all the required responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and run into the little Larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are hilarious pieces in abundance. In a scene like this, Arthur (drunk for most of the story) knocks on the wrong door of the apartment and receives ear-piercing threats from a human "siren" ("My husband has a gun !!!!). The performances of all the people involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's ruthless and loving grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his bitter enemies (he brought the Oscar home for it), and Christopher Cross provides main theme song (Oscar) "The best you can". It's a shame that Dudley Moore disappeared last month (March 2002).
