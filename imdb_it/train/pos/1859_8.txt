In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes a true story that is also a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that is expected from Washington's efforts, but now we see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> We have recently seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen into public protection cracks. This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can choose the first problems with close-ups and not the best of modifying these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the academy faces this film it will be traverse. This film does not punch and faces the cold realities of history with a purity that usually does not transcend from a novel to the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so go see it and tell your friends to go and see it too!
