This film must be my all-time favorite. His shouldn't have a plot, because its creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to think it was a real sniffing movie. This was an exercise in visual effects, and it does not stop when the action happens like any other film. The films these days are now all focused on sound effects, and let the images be created by computers because it is easier to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can't make fake blood look like reality. There is no rape scene because it was not the point of making the film. Did you see the hills having eyes 2? The rape scene was fun rather than shocking. Although I'm sure there are some GONZO porn producers who have tried to marry porn with horror. But since they probably suck at making movies, they probably wouldn't be able to make it. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and show everything even if the film in general sucks. <br /> <br /> It is too bad that a film cannot be made without thinking of the monetary aspect of all this, especially when it comes to an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his movie series Hostel much better, but he's too tamed to get an R rating ... or at least I hope his films have been sucked into these limitations. <br /> <br /> Watch traces of death or more of smashed pumpkins if you don't want real movies with no frills (accident scenes and crime scenes). Don't forget that this film was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still resist most of the crap made these days says a lot about this film. It would be like someone saying that the 8-bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.
