I found myself at six-seventy while watching this. Altman's touch with the zoom in and out were there, and I expected those devices to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, sometimes they were free, sometimes witty, often sterile for not pointing out some ironic or other connection. In particular, two zoom-outs from the golden dome in the savannah were only perplexing. To be honest, however, some zoom (outs and ins) for Branagh have accentuated the growing confusion of his character, one of Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow. Overall, the zooms were, well, inconsistent and sometimes even trivial. <br /> <br /> Other Almanesque devices, such as multiple panels of glass between camera and subject, have managed to suggest the sollipsism of the characters or narcissism or opacity states of knowledge. The windshields of the car, the windows of the house and other screens were used effectively and fairly coherently, I felt, returning to play THE PLAYER and even THE LONG GOODY. Some captivating jumps, in particular to a suggestive TV commercial, reminded me of this use in SHORT CUTS, with a sardonic effect. <br /> <br /> But finally, the mismatch between Altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of Grisham-kind momentum failed to excite me. The masterpieces of this director from the 1970s revisited and deconstructed various classical genres, including the detective film that somehow resembled this one; this time the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytical quiver to give a significant blow to the soft belly of this bestial genre. Was he perhaps gagged by mammon makers, perhaps? Or am I missing something, due to my lack of knowledge of the genre that he takes on here? <br /> <br /> However, the casting was excellent in everything: Tom Berenger (for his terrifying wound), Branagh for his (deflated) hybris, the pheromonic haze of Robert Downey Jr, the junk method of Robert Duvall and the fatal feminine fatality of Davidtz were almost all perfect choices. And apart from a few slips from Georgia to Chicago by (brunette?) Daryl Hannah, the accents were convincing in the south. The suspense and the mood were compelling, even if the story was not quite replayed by onlookers. The moodiness of a pre-hurricane coastal barometric dive was exquisitely, painstakingly made - it seemed to me to shout to the usher to turn on the swamp cooler ready. <br /> <br /> Torn, in the end I judged it a 7. <br /> <br />
