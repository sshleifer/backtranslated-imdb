Part of what was so great about classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irreverence and the way they weren't afraid of doing whatever they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian is in charge of bringing back an Earthman. Sure enough, he meets Bugs Bunny, who warns of a mutiny by Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally captured Bugs - by means of a jacket from the Acme strait - expelling the bazooka! - Bugs has other things planned for the journey back to Mars. What I mean is, if you thought it was a big change in the Solar System when they stripped Pluto of its planet status, then you haven't seen anything yet! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" does everything. The way they buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean "hare" - is to have fun. And believe me, you will surely do it. After all, a small space never hurts anyone.
