"The Tempest" by Shakespeare is a model for this exceptional science fiction film. Let's look for the differences. Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, are stranded on a Mediterranean island. "Morbius and Altaira are abandoned on the 4th planet that surrounds the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a servant created by man. The evil of Caliban hardly comes close to that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare saves Prospero "Morbius dies when Altair 4 explodes." The storm "is a comedy." The Forbidden Planet "is a tragedy. We wonder if humanity should suffer the fate of Krell in the future. Francis is Altaira, Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman and Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy / western television series "Maverick".
