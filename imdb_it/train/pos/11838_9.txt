This is one of the most relaxing, relaxing and wonderfully made animation films I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the film, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This film is not simply great for children, but also for adults. It teaches you lessons, like never forgetting who you are, you can do everything you keep your mind on, and brave and daring. This film can make people cry sometimes, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is fun, sad, cute and keeps you at the edge of your place! Some movies give you an indistinct feeling after seeing them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my 9/10 star rating for animation, music and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of Spirit!
