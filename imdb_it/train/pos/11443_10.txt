This film is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. The profound vision of an artist, his art that intuitively springs from his natural source brings us an inspirational Hosanna, who blends his creations with trees, white water that breaks into rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the spectator joy of being alive, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious land. He does not spare us his occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle in uniting art with nature. The credit also goes to the director, Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing. <br /> <br /> If you want beauty, nature and art ... don't miss this fantastic film!
