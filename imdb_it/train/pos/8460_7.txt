Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it for letting me into Gundam and souls in general. However, after looking at his predecessors, like Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I find that Wing was Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: A long held aspect by Gundam is having their characters pushed into difficulties and grow into maturity. This does not happen in Wing. Heero is the best dog in the beginning, and is the best dog in the end. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zech, who is actually a hero for most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has a very elegant design. The Gundams are fantastic, with Epyon as my favorite. I also consider some of the OZ coveralls to be on par with some of the classic Zeon costumes. But the design of sweet suits does not save the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has fantastic fight scenes, although full of recycled animation, but superficial plot and character development. Pleasant, but does not move like the previous Gundam releases.
