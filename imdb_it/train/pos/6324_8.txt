These guys are anything but the usual suspects! They are a bunch of nice monsters that you want to see get away with, but they are so unlucky that there are very few possibilities. No one is better than William H Macy in portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck. This is probably his best performance since Fargo. Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection, and the rest of the band was uniformly good. Luis Guzman brought great comedic relief like Cosimo, and George Clooney stole every scene in his cameo role. The robbery scene was absolutely hilarious in the end. <br /> <br /> The management was also seen by the Russo brothers. There was certainly a feeling of Coen brothers throughout the film and it will be interesting to see how their careers develop. They have a long way to go to match the Coen, but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid release. ....... "Yo mutha is a whore"!
