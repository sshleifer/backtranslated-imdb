This comic is short on the plot, but it's visually stunning. There will be very, very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is incredibly light-underground gnomes are responsible for the return of spring every year, but must deal with a winter not yet ready to retreat. Both the gnomes and the storm have their songs. It's practically the plot, as it is. But this comic is not about the plot, it's about color and animation. The images are exceptional. In 1936, such brilliant color was still a novelty and here is an incredibly inspired work. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of liquefied colors through the tubes. At more than one point, there are a series of tubes lined up in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the tubes and the musical track makes it seem like the row is a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The images of the battle between the emerging vegetation and the winter storm that refuses to leave quietly are extremely well executed. These types of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for, but they probably also contributed to their definitive departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably exceeded the budget and finally decided that they could control costs better if the department of animation were managed by someone a little more aware of the costs than those of Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is really a nice cartoon and worth seeing. It is available on the Attack of the 30s Characters DVD. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
