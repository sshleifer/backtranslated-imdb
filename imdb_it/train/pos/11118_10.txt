The "gangster" genre is now a worn-out subject that is too often subject to parody. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of previous cliches that have been used of its kind, fortunately the writers have advanced this flaw by creating a realism that has been applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic saga of crime that illustrates its content with psychological depth that is characterized by subtle nuances, humor and violence without suffering violence. The main protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a dangerous general without fear and moral values ​​by his crew, however, Tony is of two characters one who is bestial while the other is in conflict with guilt and resentment. Without any inhibition or contradiction, I firmly believe that the Sopranos have the finest cast of recent memory. All things considered, I could make an elaborate statement about the series, but I won't. If ever a visual dictionary existed in global consumerism, the search for these definitions vital, ambiguous, inexorable, epic, uncompromising and the super-shattered face will smile at you.
