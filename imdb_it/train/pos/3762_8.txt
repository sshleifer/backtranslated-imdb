Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two duplicates of San Dimas who are sent on another journey of life, as someone of the future feels exactly the opposite of how it was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> the only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and ends up being both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they have the chance to have a life after life to play with him for the chance to come back and stop two evil robots from ruining the future they were supposed to have. In addition to the roles they have ... er ... perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original Battleship copy in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I liked this film better than the original is because it's about "how it could be" instead of "what it was". Without ruining the film, I can't give you more information on this (I think you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
