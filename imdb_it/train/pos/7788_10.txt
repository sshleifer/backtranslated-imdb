I love Ashley Judd and I think all his films are fantastic. Ruby <br /> <br /> in Paradise is one of his best. It is an undervalued film that you really need to look closely to appreciate it. A story of a woman who tries to make it on her own and refuses to give in to the temptations that would make her life easy. Some of his films like Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill probably went better at the box office and video rental. They were also good films <br /> <br />, but take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you'll agree that he's one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
