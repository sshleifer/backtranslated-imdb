At least for half an hour a week. I hadn't been interested in big networks 3 (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, although sometimes Larry can be boring. I really like the action figures of Middle-earth that they bring with Hunter. Most of the other characters are also interesting. Even the Siegfried and Roy show is fun sometimes. The animation is top notch, and certainly the best CG that was done on a weekly television program. Usually when they take big names to perform in a show, they're trying to hide a poor script or characters. It is not entirely true in this show however, there are a couple of characters that have been weak and improved by dubbing, but overall the characters are alone. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for the 16 years. There's nothing here that most guys haven't heard before though, and most of the jokes would probably fly right over their heads. It's not quite as rough and edgy as South Park, but it carries the same "Bash Everyone". An example is that he makes fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand simultaneously in one episode. <br /> <br /> The Pride's father and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of grown up humor. It may not be as witty as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope it ends well this season, and will be renewed for future seasons. Otherwise I could never find a reason to look again at the big 3.
