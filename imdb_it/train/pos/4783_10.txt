"The Straight Story" is a really nice film about an old man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his stranger and dying brother. But this is just the basic synapse ... this movie talks a lot more about it. This was the last role of Richard Farnworth before he died, and he is certainly one of those for whom he will be remembered. He is a stubborn old man, not unlike many of the old ones you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a film that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. It will come down and touch a part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.
