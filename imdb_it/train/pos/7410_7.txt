I happened upon "Shower" in the foreign film section of my local video store and I went through it several times because it looked like a farce or a comedy from its cover. I then found a copy to buy at a cheap price and I'm happy for my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, a father and two (2) adult children, each of whom deals with life changes while the world around them continues to change even in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this film. <br /> <br /> Beyond the fascinating characteristics of the place, the Chinese color that gives the setting to this story, is the difficult and moving relations between men and one woman involved in the story, all set against a public bath in the village. <br /> <br /> Family history goes from estrangement to understanding and makes me happy to meet these people. To the main story are added the numerous small characters, the customers of the beach establishments, their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a film that moves away from smiling and from its warmth and humanity.
