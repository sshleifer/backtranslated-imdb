I just started watching the TV series "What I Like About You" and I have to say it's a joy to watch. I always like to see new shows doing well, considering that many shows turn off before you really get an idea. I saw Amanda Bynes from "All That" is really a funny girl, the best thing about her play is that it's so natural and what I mean, it's something a person could say here, the best friend, it's I haven't tried. <br /> <br /> I just started watching the show and fell in love. I'm just looking at the replies right now, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters of the show give something to the whole plot. It's nice to see some old faces from other shows that I enjoyed watching in the past, like Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys". Even the new character is very talented, Nick Zano has that charm that makes you love even when he is doing something wrong with the holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall this show has the right ingredients to succeed, I can't wait to see it grow.
