How powerful and engaging simple quality cinema can be. This film tells its story with everyday scenes that manage to revive the intensity that is hidden inside. It is true as others have stated, how this film really makes it clear that Hollywood is lost in its special effects, in exaggerated emotions and in the most important climatic endings and has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with a simple realism . Much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than stated in a verbose dialogue. One aspect that I really appreciated about the film was the contrast between the two brothers, one so openly expressive in his childish way and the other completely stoic but both capable of evoking deep emotions. The older brother needed to say little, as he usually did, it was all there in his impassive face! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, excellent direction! Not to be missed!
