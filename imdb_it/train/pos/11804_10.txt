He rented the film as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went to find a used copy and bought it for myself. Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It must be said that there is a rule that made the film much better. It is not allowed to talk while the film is active, unless the words are repeated by Sasquatch in a song. I loved the merit even at the end of the film. "Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I say thank you, because without your Jeep the film may not have been made. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh about. If you want a good movie, look for something else, but if you don't mind laughing at the expense of a man in a monkey suit take a copy.
