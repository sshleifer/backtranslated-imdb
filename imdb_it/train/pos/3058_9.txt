I bought it a year or more ago for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), I left it on the shelf for years, now watching DVDs while holed up with a cold. <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing film. Brilliant performances of all the people involved, in particular the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this film). Plot reminds me of my favorite movie of all time, Grosse Pointe Blank, but of course it's carefree, this one has a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, a shudder passed over my back when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary stuff! Brilliant all-round work. <br /> <br /> Pete
