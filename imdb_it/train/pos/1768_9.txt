I haven't laughed so much during a movie for a long time. I have to go to a preliminary screening and I was thrilled because I was dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout the movie. The audience shared my laughter and applauded and shouted for much of the film. Congratulations to Steve Carrell (of whom I was already a fan). In this film he shows his incredible talent for comedy. It has a style I've never seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a Will Ferrell cameo (you love it, but I saw it too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were parts of the comic genius in this film. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to writing (also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed giver with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I will surely see "40 years virgin" when it is published. My advice: go see it for great laughs and an incredibly fun movie about it.
