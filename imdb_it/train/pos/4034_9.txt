Pinjar is a really good film, with great acting, good fiction, good presentation, moving emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of the films that Bollywood is producing is improving these days, and this film is a test. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood film I remember has had such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the film for hours - marveling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human being. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great acting of Urmilla Matondkar and also on Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in the north of India against the background of the partition, and all the problems seem sweet compared to the problems she encounters. <br /> <br /> An unmissable film. A technically superior Bollywood product, which I think is comparable to the best films released in other countries of the world.
