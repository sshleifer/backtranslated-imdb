I started watching this film with nothing, just another movie to watch, but from the first twenty minutes, the artwork and the main character, who is enigmatic, doesn't talk much, really involved me in this film. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie, it was dark, beautifully acted and really moving. It's a bit slow but the dive was complete. The direction was fantastic, letting us know little by little the story that led to Joey's conviction and his life behind bars. The music was truly exceptional and very well integrated into the scenes. The ending was unexpected with a turning point that I didn't see coming. It's not the kind of film we see often.
