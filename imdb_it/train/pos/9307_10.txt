It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I'm a lover of black comedy. With a cast including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London) on leashes, the lines can only be dry. The supporting cast is almost dead. Counting the small imperfections of the film: Ellen Barkin's make-up gave her a faded look; there were a couple of Joie Bishop and Richard Pryor cameos that had no purpose and Michael J. Pollard's time was too short. Overall, the cast was simply unbelievable without ego to destroy a beautiful script. If you've seen the film by Larry Bishop (writer, director), Underworld (a dark crime film), you'll like this. His next release (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
