I recently bought the Dreamcast, very underestimated, and I went to the city to find some games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (A classic) and then I crossed the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 and 2, and I've played Res Evil 3 on numerous occasions, and I was impressed by all of them, especially the number 1 that has to go down in history has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them 3 comes close to the dream of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it's just to buy a dreamcast for this game, it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so fascinated by a computer game that fascinated me. <br /> <br />, the story takes its cue from the second story in which Claire Redfield searches for her brother (Chris - from the 1st story), who allegedly disappeared under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella company. Little is known about this society, except that you have destroyed them 3 times in precedents. <br /> <br /> So, by helping Claire, with Super Brat assistant Steve, you need to unlock the truth of your brother's true position. The 2nd CD allows you to control Chris, this is if you can get that far without running out of fear. <br /> <br /> Control is very fluid and the movement of the characters is magnificently realistic, when the character notices the danger, he / she faces the direction from which he comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> In general I gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, the game of the decade and the best game in the world, period and that's it !!. Please purchase this game as soon as possible.
