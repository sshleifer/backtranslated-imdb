Weak scripts sometimes? Yup! Cheese special effects sometimes? Yup! Delightfully guilty pleasure most of the time? Yup! More information on Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yup! I've always enjoyed science fiction as a child, but I found so much of the Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff as just crap. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and it took Carl Kolchak to win the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all those weak screenplays, the special cheese effects, that baroque group of secondary characters, actors and guest stars, was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had an ironic sense of humor despite the danger, he was an idealist in his search for truth, and a realist when it came to accepting mandatory incompetence and possible coverage by government officials. Furthermore, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to bend his neck and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his end, the end of his journalistic career, or jail time. For all his faults, including no taste in his clothes, Carl Kolchak was a charming and witty man who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old car used at the time) on the way to save the day for humanity. Like every other imaginary hero, Carl Kolchak was the hero of every man brought to life every week for a season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that it's past and its show is on DVD, I hope you have a lot of fun while watching it while you enjoy playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
