The word "classic" has turned too loosely today, but this film deserves the title. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (perhaps the best comedian in the world) and the late George Burns make a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to think about what the film would have been like if death had not prevented Jack Benny from playing the role of George Burns, as planned. As it is, the scene of the reunion in Matthau's apartment is probably not surpassed as a bully. Definitely one of my films on desert islands. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
