I always like to see films that make you think, and not just drip the answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow, with a little concentration and an open mind I understood. First time. True, it is not comparable to other mind-mucks like "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but in itself it is an intelligent and stimulating film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how damn good it is. Every scene, every angle of shooting seems to have been thought for centuries. If you see it you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> So to conclude ... look at it with an open mind and you could enjoy it. Otherwise, well, no one has ever said that "Revolver" is for everyone. And this is my 2 cents.
