I just watched this delicious Japanese film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this film, subtitled in English, has the dance as its heart, the film actually shows the world outside Japan, like the rigid family structures, employment (salary) and recreation still exist in present-day Japan. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting the family name (surname) first and the given name (last)) uses the not very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [Also, I will not use the names of the characters in the movies when readers around the world may not be familiar with the formal Japanese names that they might confuse. I will refer to the actors <br /> <br /> with their professional acting name as listed in the Internet Data Movie Base.] <br /> <br /> Enlist the help of his real wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his first and, so far, only film. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. However, his real ambition is to compete once again in an international dance competition that has been disqualified in the past. No, I won't say "why". Watch the film. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main protagonist of the film. A veteran of about 25 films since 1979, gives a sterling performance of a 1940s businessman who has a lovely wife, a teenage daughter, and has just bought his own house. /> desire. <br /> <br /> And yet, something is missing from his inner happiness. Watch this film to learn how to "get involved" in ballroom dancing and go secretly to <br /> <br /> lessons. Most of the dancing characters are freed from the traditional hierarchy of social structure <br /> <br />. They are friendly, warm and inviting. Of course, this is in stark contrast to the way in which Japanese society is structured with its "place for all and everyone in its place" philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film has so many fun moments. The nearly 1,500 theater spectators have broken <br /> <br /> into spontaneous laughter during many of the comic moments. This shows <br /> <br /> that the play does not have a foreign language. <br /> <br /> The veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is fun and brilliant as is Watanabe Eriko. They are two very nice actors. <br /> <br /> One could buy and read a college textbook about the structure of life in Japan, or you could see this good movie and begin to understand how <br /> <br /> People of the Japan is growing in a rather rigid corporate structure. Watching the movie "Shall we Dansu?" is a quick immersion in further studies and in watching other Japanese films <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's fun, it's fascinating, it will make you cry a little, and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
