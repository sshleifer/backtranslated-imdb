I just saw Holly along with another film about child trafficking and sexual exploitation called Trade at Film by the Sea. I have to say Holly blew Trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and surprising film on many different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematographic perspective, it is surprising. Sound mixing, camera angle, direction and acting are all well chosen. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the way it handles the topic is tasteful and not exploitable. It presents the issue of sexual exploitation of children in both educational and accurate ways. The filmmakers paid exquisite attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the sexual exploitation and child trafficking epidemic. Too often when it comes to such a topic, one is tempted to amaze the public with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve this without falling into that typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the United States and once in Holland. I can honestly say that I have never seen the public more moved. Only by listening to conversations after screening, people are wondering what they can do personally to combat the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and for the topic.
