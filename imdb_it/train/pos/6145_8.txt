Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but this is still a good film. Angela Lansbury is splendidly dull as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has a lot of fun as Mr. Brown. Even their chemistry was simply brilliant. The children, however, lacked the same sparkle, even though Paul is very funny and cute. The songs really weren't as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are exceptional. The special effects were wonderful, they had a lot of magic, and the story is quite original. The highlights, however, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was the soccer game, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I didn't get the final when I saw it for the first time. All in all, a lovely film, which is almost never turned on. 8/10 Bethany Cox
