The first time I came across Delirious, I just heard it. I listened to all the comic performance and I never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious images in our mind and make a great imitation is captivating. When I finally managed to see him perform this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! Being the new millennium, his acts in 1983 are just as fun today as they were then. My parents loved him as a teenager and I (eighteen) loved him too. From that moment on, I had to see other Murphy films like Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
