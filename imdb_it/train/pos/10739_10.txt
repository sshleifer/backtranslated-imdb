Incredible documentary I have seen it in the original version and on DVD a few times in recent years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for the best Oscar for the documentary in 2002, the year it was published. No other documentary even comes close. <br /> <br /> He was on TV recently for the fifth anniversary, but in the end I lost the "where I am now" segment, except that I realized that tony now works for the hazmat unit. <br /> <br /> I've seen criticism on the documentary film from some on this list. I can't see how this could have been done differently. They had less than 6 months to assemble this and do it on air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that according to IMDb.com, the brother has not had any projects in the following four years. What are they doing?
