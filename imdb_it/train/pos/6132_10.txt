I'm glad that the users (starting from this date) who liked this movie now come forward. I don't understand the people who didn't like this movie - they seem to expect serious treatment (?!?!?)! Come on, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew it was a stupid premise and did not try to deny it. The delivery of direct scenes makes it really FUN! Yes, there are times when the low budget shows (like that explosion scene), but I think an expensive aspect would take away the fun of the movie! So if you like B movies, and the stupid premise fascinates you, you will surely like "Jack Frost".
