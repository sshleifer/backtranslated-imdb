THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> The Hitchcockian suspender gives Williams a low profile performance. <br /> <br /> What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia that is associated with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the last derange fan scenario, based not less on real events, Williams plays the character of a talking radio called Gabriel Nobody, who reads stories he wrote about the ether and accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who presented a manuscript on the travails of his problematic youth to Nobody's publisher, Ashe (Morton), who does not give anyone to read for himself. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally disturbed but eventually intrigued by Pete's nightmarish existence who is kidnapped and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette which offers an excellent performance) that adopted the boy but his correspondence with Nobody reveals that Pete is dying of AIDS. Of course nobody wants to meet the fans, but all of a sudden it is doubtful for their possible devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his alien lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has no one in a an emotional tilt that has only just grown into a storm in a teacup when he decides to investigate Donna and Pete's backgrounds by uncovering some truths he didn't foresee. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with her former lover Terry Anderson and the film's novice, director Stettner, and based on a true story of an uncovered fan joke , he has some tense Hitchcock moments as any good old boiler does ... Help Williams give a strong, low-key performance like the good-hearted and conflicted personality that genuinely wants to believe that her number one fan is actually real and you love him (the only thing that escaped his reality) and he has some disturbing terrible moments with the creepy Collette whose only physical trait I will not leave mentioned but underlines the desperation of his character that can make you beat up to the core. <br /> <br /> However the film ends without gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable, despite a finely directed piece of cape and mystery by Stettner, it's worth listening to your whole voice hours: pay attention to what you hope for.
