I'm sitting here in 2006, and I still can't be excited about this movie. Arnold's best films came in around 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are fantastic. Arnold's monkeys in this film will make you laugh on more than one occasion. I find that acting in this film is surprisingly good as in the case of Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job trying to make the scenes as futuristic as they should be in 2017, but you can't help but giggle at the 80s-style scraps of men and women in the crowd and regular television monitors in the Running Man studio which we all know here in 2006, is coming out with the emergence of flat screens and HDTVs. Even the computer graphics of the introduction of the game "The Running Man" would not look like this in 2017. However the plot is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this film did I want to get up and not worry about the ending which is something I often do with today's films. I really think that Arnold's acting is much better than the one he gave credit to. Now I would not have elected governor, but this is California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are fantastic "stalkers" and I find that the producers don't try to overcrowd the fighting scenes. When the stalker died ... he died. It does not go on for 20 minutes each. Stalker scenes are fast and fun, but they don't try to exaggerate. I give this film a 10/10 and this comes from someone who doesn't enjoy many movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic visualizations you would see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
