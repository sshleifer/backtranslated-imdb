One of the best early musicals, Anchors Aweigh presents several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi directing and much more. The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera features, like seeing a piano played from below, through transparent keys and Grayson's singing, seen through the viewfinder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you get involved in the enthusiasm of Kelly and Sinatra. Sailor is on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To put it up with her aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra audition her with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this, and in his own sung words he falls in love too quickly. While they are trying to contact Iturbi, who is never available, he begins to fall in love with another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is now falling in love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is often remembered for the live-action / cartoon sequence combination with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot more here than it's worth a look. I give him nine stars because, even if it's not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - it's one of the first of their Technicolor big production class (maybe Meet Me In St. Louis was the first) and better than many others.
