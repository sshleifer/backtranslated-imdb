Because of all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost didn't look at it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty horror movie. The acting wasn't great - apart from the wonderful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogues ("Just think of yourself at lunch") was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, Stephen King's above-average effort - 7/10.
