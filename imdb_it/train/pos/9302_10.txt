Most comments were positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The production designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It is worth paying attention to The film is driven by the characterization and symbolism that is very rich. All the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a pleasure. The dialogue was fun at times, but sometimes prodded and I suppose it was meant to be that way. This is a film by a movie fan. It was created by people, for people who love the medium. Don't miss this.
