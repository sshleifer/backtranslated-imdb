Of course the plot, the script and, above all, the casting are strong in the film. So many beautiful things to see. One aspect that I particularly liked is the idea of ​​the antagonist - Luzhini (Turturro's) - a former mentor who works his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent - an Italian three-piece dandy and stick - turns out to be a truly excellent gentleman and chess player. To his credit the nobly "adversary" follows the plan at the end to complete the final game for the posthumous championship (Luzhin has removed a flyer from a window - sad, but thus getting rid of him) through the unstable genius' widow (Emily Watson .) In death, therefore, due to the gallantry of an honorable chess master, Luzhin's defense (which he elaborated in a late moment of lucidity) can be played. The Italian gentleman praises the game and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "final game!"
