I saw this show based on the fact that he was told he remembered David Lynch's Twin Peaks, a show I love. The show starts quickly introducing us to the main characters and, rather unusually, the pilot episode is for me the best of the lot, it's extremely dramatic and really manages to churn out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress the rest of the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt a little disappointed with the show - probably not because of its own fault, since it was canceled after a simple season, it seemed to show a lot of potential and deserved a much better treatment than it got. The acting is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and bad) in it I've ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time. There is the strange type effect for the first 5 or 10 shows that are a little too dramatic, but this is correct as the season progresses. Worth a watch, certainly something out of the ordinary!
