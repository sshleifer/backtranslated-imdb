Dark Angel is a futuristic science fiction series set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, centered on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically improved young woman fleeing her creators. <br /> <br /> The universe of Dark Angel is absorbent, (not so much like saying Buffy, but still absorbing) with a set of interesting and credible characters. Of course, it's not for everyone, but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the funniest series out there. Dark Angel is criminally neglected, and undervalued, and unfortunately was canceled after only 2 series. Which was a real shame, because it had the potential to become a great series, even though its 42 episodes are only 10 timid of the long-running BBC science fiction comedy Red Dwarf. Since Dark Angel remains unfinished, look for it, and if you want more, drop by Fox to do another series.
