The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they hadn't used any of the original characters. I was rather surprised by how it turned out. As a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with some exceptions. Although this was not a great film, the writer did well to keep the main themes and traditions of the first vampires intact. Initially Jon Bon Jovi was at a disadvantage, but he proved to be a Slayer halfway. I doubt anyone could play James Wood's performance in the first one, though ... unless you bring Buffy in! <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a decent watch and I looked at it again. > <br /> I was left with two questions, but ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a murderer? I suppose we'll have to leave it to the imagination.
