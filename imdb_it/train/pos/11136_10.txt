"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that has been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reasons: it's really one of the best movies ever made in America. It is both artistically valid but entirely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when it was initially published. But beware, it is also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable, well developed and eventually tragic. Filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood finale, something that was fundamentally mandatory in the 1980s. However, this is why I treasure the years from 1967 to 1977 for American cinema. It is a time when well-made, innovative and above all shabby films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. This is all over when "Star Wars" came out. <br /> <br /> The management of John Schlesinger makes the material work. Combines a simplistic style with some experimental modifications. Unlike many other films with these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has aged quite well. It is still as powerful now as when it was initially released. However, acting is what makes this a masterpiece. The backgrounds of the characters are never completely explained, but the performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and understanding (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Furthermore, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set in the infamous 42nd street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful movies ever made.
