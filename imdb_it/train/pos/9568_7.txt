Some comments here on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog to classic Cat III films of the 90s, but despite being undoubtedly brutal, violent and very discouraging, this Pou-Soi Cheang film is not really shabby, scary or sensationalist earns that comparison However, it still offers a punch that makes it worthy of a watch, especially if the gritty and sharp action is your passion. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian man-woman who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate a judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. With Wai approaching his goal, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, an illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape his life of abuse. <br /> <br /> A harsh relentless drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a disturbing soundtrack and solid performances by Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one of the fans of Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of the Chan-wook Park revenge trilogy). Boxers, shootings, merciless beatings: everything takes place regularly in this film and is captured smoothly by director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Naturally, this is the kind of story destined to have an unhappy ending for all those involved, and quite sure, practically everyone in this film dies (rather bad deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and comedy (involuntary), and in his last moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a ridiculously dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are stuck in battle while a pregnant Yue watches. Eventually, after all three suffered serious gunshot wounds during the fracas, a wounded Pang performed a DIY Ceasarean on a Yue (now dead), delivering their little moments before he died himself. <br /> <br /> While this film may not be a "classic" slice of the excess of Hong Kong, with its deliriously OTT action and its elegant graphics, it is still worth looking for.
