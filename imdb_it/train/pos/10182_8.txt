good movie, good music, good background and acceptable plot. but the main point yet how his films tend to be, man is the best actor of idia and can turn dust into gold. Nana Patekar. this could be his second best performance after parinda (the others might disagree). although other films are not far behind. a man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> nice movie even though I think Shahrukh was a luxury that this movie could have done without. you can see in his films, others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skin. but this man is really something elastic. <br /> <br /> the film is beautiful, the music and the direction is an excellent plot a little thin but the screen and the dialogue are again very good. absolutely to watch
