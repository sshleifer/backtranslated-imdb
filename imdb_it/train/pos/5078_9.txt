This stood out for its originality. I'm seriously tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a lot of Hollywood and Brit movies. Some defects were inevitable, however, this film is a must see. Surya's portrait of the clean and conscientious policeman (as opposed to the bulging, thirsty for money we normally see) was fantastic. He has come a long way from his work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. I don't usually deal with the genre of films without violence, somehow I really felt for each character and so I can't really call myself "mindless" violence. I don't appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I loved this film because it lacks the same. ACP Anbuselvan's reaction to losing his wife is not exaggerated, it is heartbreaking and makes me want to shout my eyes. There are times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in a movie theater. Never wanted to do it when you watch this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will soon be published.
