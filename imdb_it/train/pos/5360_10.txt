Among the one-standard action films, where acting and logic are controlled at the door, this film is at the top of the class. If the casting director had put "good" actors in this film, it would have been worse (except Richard Dawson who actually acted well, if you can call recite yourself "acting"). I love this movie! The man who runs is probably the gift of God for man (perhaps only good for men). Surely the most quotable film of our time, so I leave you with my favorite phrase: "It's all part of the rich scheme of life, Brenda, and you better do F ***** g to get used to it". Ahh, more people have been called "Brenda" to quote this film than I can imagine.
