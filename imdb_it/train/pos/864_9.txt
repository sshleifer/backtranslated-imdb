Surely one of the French films of the decade up to now, a tense and atmospheric thriller that takes full advantage of the main characters who have felt the impediment of using sound in a way that is rarely explored in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos offers a truly stunning and multi-faceted performance, sometimes subtle and manipulative, sometimes open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offers from France.
