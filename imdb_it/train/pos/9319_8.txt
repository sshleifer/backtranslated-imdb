....... Reproducing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was quite large and a cry. I love seeing him interact with Amanda Blake, or with Don Knotts or anyone - clearly he was having a ball and I think it was easier for his guests too - until they knew ahead of time that he wasn't a disciplined one, 19 take kind of production. Relaxing and being relaxed was clearly the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe even Jerry Lewis. Extraordinary timing, ancient gags that kept the audience for decades, pure fun for what they were doing. Even his sad fool who played was beautiful - but so touching. <br /> <br /> Personally I think it's great, having just bought a double set of DVDs of his shows from '61 or so, he brings his stuff back in a way that is fond of me. I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he finished the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Check it if you are a fan or curious. It was a revolt.
