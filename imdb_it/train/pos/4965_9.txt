Of all the football films I've seen, this is one of the 2 best. The other is fever. But Hero is the biggest world cup ever and therefore is probably also the greatest player ever in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story focuses mainly on him, but revolves around the other giants of the game at that time. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is evocative and the images are powerful. Michael Caine's narrative is appropriately impartial and even quietly dramatic. This story does not concern the individual games of the world cup; rather it is the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like France and Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) have been tackled in the same way. Even the final Argentin v W Germany was in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, especially if you are a Maradona fan.
