My favorite Jackie Chan film will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 film, "Police Story". In it, Chan plays a super-Hong Kong cop who discovers a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then tasked with protecting the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that he can transform the state's evidence. As the story continues, the gangster sends his henchmen to send Lin, but Chan takes things with his fists and feet, while keeping the girl Maggie Cheung away. As "Drunken Master", "Police Story" has many of the distinctive martial arts and action stunts and choreographies that Chan has become famous for, culminating in a royal battle in a busy shopping center. In his role as director, Chan exceeds excellence, giving a charismatic and fun performance that accentuates action. Reading the slapstick humor of "Drunken Master", basically "Police Story" is just that, a detective story, a brave script-thriller that would often be copied in the years to come. <br /> <br /> 10/10
