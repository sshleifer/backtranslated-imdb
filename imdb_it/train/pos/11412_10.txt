Benevolently and intelligently interpreted by the two girls, Mischa Barton in the role of Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe in the role of Hazel, although the plot is rather a stretch of imagination. Young Hazel running for the mayor seems out of place, to be honest. <br /> <br /> While the acting is well done by all interested parties, the film tends to lack an authentic dramatic atmosphere. Perhaps we have grown to expect the gritty reality in the movies, rather like comparing Pollyanna with How Green Was My Valley! It doesn't matter, every one of them is good in his own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright although his role is a bit subdued here. The medium of entertainment on the road is well suited to younger spectators, and how beautiful it is sometimes to be exposed to quality classical music which is almost a rarity! <br /> <br /> I find this film a welcome change because it reflects quieter, caring values ​​for the years of growth, and no violence thanks to heaven. A warm family movie to enjoy.
