I really enjoyed this movie and went back to see it twice more in a week. <br /> <br /> Ms. Detmers nailed the performance - she was like a hungry cat looking for prey, playing with her prey. He goes wild in anger and lust, taking a "too young" lover and bringing down hundreds of fine porcelain pieces of his terrorist boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful touches. The Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I particularly appreciated the ancient Greek lesson and the recitation of 'Antigone'. <br /> <br /> He had the feeling of 'Story of O' - that is, where the people of the media indulge in a wild sexual adventure. As she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff, she is at ease - and why not, what does holding a "Devil in the Flesh" mean? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real surprise!
