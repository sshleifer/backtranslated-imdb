A super extraordinary film by Audiard, Read My Lips is a pulpy and solitary thriller. It is perfect for Vincent Cassel's conspicuous grizzled charisma and presents a wonderfully contained exhibition by Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard appears for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: of unconventional beauty (to which all are considered unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. <br /> <br /> This is almost the definition of his role as Carla, an office dog questioned, taunted by colleagues who exploit his deafness. Yet he finds a love of exploitation, if you like in the former cone of Cassel Paul. Each exploits the unconventional talents of the other (reading theft and lip) to fight through their respective situations and form an unconventional romantic rapprochement. Devos / Audiard manages Carla's deafness and her inner, deformed inner world with a discreet and elegant touch. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001) Audiard already clearly has control of his tension, action and investment management of his structure with a truly visceral experience that will become the great success - A Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
