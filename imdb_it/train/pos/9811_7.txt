According to Joel McCrea's book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author claims that Albuquerque was the only film he personally didn't review because he claimed he was lost. He had not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Luckily for western fans someone was doing some spring cleaning at Paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's on the open market. Albuquerque is also a pretty good western with Scott involved in a family feud with Uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends for his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making it part of his transport business, based in the rapidly growing settlement of Albuquerque. Cleveland is more than just an entrepreneur, he is the head of the city who runs from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero at all. This includes not supporting relatives when they are bad. He goes to work for a rival group led by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and even sends a Western Mata Hari in the person of Barbara Britton to make her way in the confidence of her rivals. Barbara is fantastic like the housewife fox who develops her agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, where he had his first studio contract. Albuquerque scored the last film he ever made for Paramount and gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Also note Lon Chaney, Jr., who is the head-hunter of George Cleveland, a rather hateful overbearing man and Gabby Hayes, who is only Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque must have been loved by Republicans throughout the nation in 1948 with its evil boss as head of a wheelchair-bound city. A certain democrat, in a wheelchair, had made a hash for four consecutive presidential elections and was gone. They had high hopes of winning the White House that year too, but things went wrong and they had to settle for a bossy boss who got his well-deserved party in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair, since there wasn't really one in the plot. My hypothesis is that he was injured and played the part that way because he had to. <br /> <br /> Still Albuquerque must have had a huge market appeal for the GOP.
