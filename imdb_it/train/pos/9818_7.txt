Robert Culp (they call his character "doctor" ... I think he is a vet or something) and the family moves to a wealthy suburb, low cost, zero law. Culp with the jaw of the lantern and his dog are almost killed when some children from the nearby local idiot get drunk and "cruise" through his yard at 60 miles per hour. He presses the accusations, which arouses the anger of children, and suddenly he and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing campaign of jokes. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Manson, um, Marlyn Mason rather, plays her irritable, boiled - exquisite wife, who urges him not to use violence against his mocking nemesis, and who really wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But The System is making Culp go crazy nowhere, and he's not leaving his home because of some punk guys and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what movies do when The System fails ... (but this is based on a true story, which makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while the wicked make the thugs have a comfortable "adolescent" 70s funk-o-matic music theme that warns us when they are not doing good, this movie actually ends up treat age brackets fairly (really!). It doesn't make it a big generational thing. Congratulations for this. <br /> <br /> However, if you like dogs (or at least you believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like justice for the way dogs of fire, and you think that people who jump nervously out of distressed communities are "too damn soft", then the ethos of this movie is your alley. No, it is not really "good", at least not in a widely recognized sense of the word. There is nothing subtle, undervalued or intelligent, it is just a kind of PSA for far-sightedness. However, it captures the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works. Do you remember Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns when Batman rides Mutants on horseback to claim Gotham City? Do you remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid pounds the bully's face? Remember how good it was? Or do I really hate being considered amusing by your neighbors? Yes, mon. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was a 1973 TV movie that I happened to see at 4 am on my local WB affiliate, and it probably isn't meant for DVD release. But after being inspired by this movie, do you think I'll sit here and take it!?!
