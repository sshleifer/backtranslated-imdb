Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It worked simultaneously with other programs on school life, such as "Teachers". My 35 years of teaching lead me to believe that Bromwell High satire is much closer to reality than "Teachers". The struggle to survive financially, the perceptive students who see through the pomp of their pathetic teachers, the meanness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn school, I immediately remembered ......... a .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to fire one of your teachers. STUDENT: welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that Bromwell High is far-fetched. What a pity it isn't!
