This is really an incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disinherited people to get their legitimate voice, but it also shows the United States for their dishonesty, subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling with what can only be called a despicable elite without any sense of proportion or justice. These directors have recorded a coup d'Ã©tat different from anything seen before. <br /> <br /> And in the viewfinder we see the United States, once again pulling the strings and confusing the sense of reality. It is heartbreaking to see the early stages of the uprising knowing full well that the subversion of democracy we are witnessing is a tool long used by successive US governments and their seemingly blinded citizens. The video makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic videos, but an active documentation of a people and its government that is fighting for its future. Truly an exciting experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to enshrine the idea that every country should be allowed to choose its government and develop in ways that most people deem suitable. The first phase of this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a great job to do it.
