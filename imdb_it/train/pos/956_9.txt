The simple hand-held camera conveys a bit of an almost documentary feeling to this film, and it also refers to dogma films. <br /> <br /> Have you ever been bored of those Hollywood-style cop gestures with muscular guys who receive James Bond assignments would be envious of? Fed up with the married-living cop, the divorced-but-family man, the personified donut and the tough hunter? Have you ever wondered what real police work is like? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. Located in the north between western Germany and eastern Germany, formerly the GDR, a dismissed post office worker begins his job as soon as he leaves police school. It soon makes its way among the usual customers and gets used to the life of a policewoman ... but it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> Other German criminal films such as Derrick, Der Alte et cetera have dignified officers to speak quietly with suspects. These policemen here have to deal with the lowest on the social scale. A good dialogue and realism make this vision interesting, even more if you know that part of Germany a little.
