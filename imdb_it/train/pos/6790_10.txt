This game is one of the best role-playing games. Punch is actually more fun than any other due to the combat system (you hurt the enemy depending on how you aim at the attack, you can turn into a dragon, special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. The characters are all adorable and you don't have long dialogs to support, as happened in several games in the Finale Fintasy series. I'm sick of that dialogue about the past, when you just want to continue the story of the game. Ambientation is a jewel in this game, combining the fantasy of the Middle Ages with futuristic science fiction. It's amazing that the animation effects are simply amazing, I like them more than others in other modern games (we can't remember that Legend of the Dragoon is 8 years old). So the Map is huge, there are all kinds of places and enemies. Finally, music is not the best game muse I've ever heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
