Many of the Americans would say ... What ?? to my opening comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to the Akira Kurosawa fans, but if you analyze this film, my comment is right. We have the farmer who goes to town looking for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the village harvest. The big difference is the way the plot takes. Our samurai, a band of circus performers as in the original are a mixture of very complex personalities but in the end they are what the village needs, EROI. Please look again at this incredible film (the Seven Samurai, of course) and find another film that has stolen the story and tried to get the same magical effect as Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. One tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his best seller, but he didn't find the cat's third foot.
