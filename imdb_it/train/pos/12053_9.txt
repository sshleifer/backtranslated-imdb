A story of well-made ghosts that will make you shiver and some beautiful and beautiful scars along the way. The story unfolds slowly, building up the atmosphere until you're ready to see the woman in black. You won't forget it once you've seen it. No blood, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that is best seen at night with the lights off.
