An Insomniac nightmare was an incredibly interesting and well-made film. I loved the way he throws you into the main character's subconscious mind without pampering the viewer ... acting was top notch - honestly, I watched Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the girl, was fantastic. I was also very impressed by the look of the film. Usually, "independent films" look grainy, the one I saw with this camcorder, but this director knows what he's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I look forward to a feature film by Tess Nanavati!
