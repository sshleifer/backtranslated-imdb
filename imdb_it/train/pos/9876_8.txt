Introducing Lily Mars is a real little film that showcases actress Judy Garland's comic abilities, along with her standard singing moments. The plot is composed by Lily Mars who follows producer John Thornway for his big break. I think the play is light and nothing too heavy here. I highly recommend this movie for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
