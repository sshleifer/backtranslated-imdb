Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this gigantic variety show that throws everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however, is present.) This film gives time to shield every person who was under contract with the Warners at that time. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it's because they were great on silent days, and most of them faded with the popularity of talkies. There are some truly remarkable artists even in the vaudeville era. You will be very impressed by Winnie Lightner, who runs two numbers. There is also that French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the major highlights is the two-strip Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which has been restored for this version. It's really beautiful and features the participation of Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the great finale "Lady Luck" which lasts almost a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic of the era of early times. Every fan of old movies will like this.
