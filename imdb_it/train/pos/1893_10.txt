Although it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, there is such a fascination in the portrait of Dudley Moore of lovable lovable, Arthur Bach cannot help but try for this unique and wonderful character. How can you not be entertained by that contagious laugh and giggle and total nonsense. Even though I'm not a fan of Liza Minnelli, she was really as good as Linda Marolla and I couldn't imagine anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and that great "Arthur's Theme" motif, wow. Actually this was one of the best comedies of the 80s. Great movies improve with every vision and this is the case with "Arthur".
