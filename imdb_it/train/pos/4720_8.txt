A beautiful film, especially if you like horses, World War II films and the austere Hungarian Plateau. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. The horsemanship is spectacular as is the horse of the main characters in its formation. <br /> <br /> I will buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family film and I highly recommend it. A good movie "Family Nite". Although there are violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The natives were very interesting in the way they stood even in the face of the certain death of a Nazi officer who had his own reasons for driving Brady out. An incredibly beautiful film.
