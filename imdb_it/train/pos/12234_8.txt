First of all, anyone looking for a meaningful result-oriented cinema that encompasses a sort of social message with meaningful performances and a soul-searching dialogue spoken by dedicated, emotional and heartfelt actors, please, go now. You are wasting your time and life is short, go see the new Brangelina Jolie movie, have a good cry, go out and buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if it makes you feel better, and leave us only. <br /> <br /> Don't let the door hit you on the way out. THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is an epic B-level film minus the regional horror set in the wasteland of Oklahoma by a young cast and TV crew, and worries about an astronaut exposed to bizarre radiation effects, wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a jerk. The melting man is played by an Alex Rebar, who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film. But once it starts with Rick Baker's extraordinary special effects trick, it looks more like something you might find in a spam box before emptying all the viscous, viscous liquids of fat. <br /> <br /> The film has zero exposure and is not intertwined with the plot points: there are a couple of scenes involving types of scientists that run on an absurd industrial machine that dutifully recites some mandatory lines on the effects of radiation, but the film doesn't really care. It's a bizarre and wonderful sight to one with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stand it - A big laugh comes when the melting man comes across a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what you do out of his eyes. Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The "hero" of the film is played by Burr DeBenning, a fascinating character from the golden television scene of the 70s and 80s who was a kind of model for Kevin Spacey's prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic, and a step ahead of most in the room, even if it seems confused. It appeared immediately after this film was made in a bizarre opera for the horror of the television anthology entitled HOUSE OF THE DEAD (or THE ALIEN ZONE) considered one of the best films ever made in Oklahoma, which is the suspicion that this film were done as well. The arid and cold landscapes of the rural Midwest are certainly the same, and the torrent that an unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport seems to be the same one that Cameron Mitchell fought flying with alien pancakes in WITHOUT ATTENTION ... he had also a sick sense of humor, a TV-friendly cast, and a nice outrageous gore. I certainly perceive at least one aesthetic connection between the three films, as well as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is no surprise given that director Jonathan Demme is part of the cast of MELTING MAN. <br /> <br /> Essentially, as others have pointed out, this is a B movie plot from the 1950s updated for the special effects of the 70s and the inevitable boobs. The film that probably borrows most of his ideas is PHANTOM FROM SPACE with Peter Graves as an astronaut returning to Earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that led him to a murderous madness. One of the things that I really admire about the film is that the motivations of the melting man are absolutely not taken into account: it simply breaks out and the drama of the film comes from wondering if it will fall apart before certain characters fall victim to its madness. The budget for the film is also deliciously low and every penny is on the screen, Rick Baker's disgusting effects make the lion's share of everything that has been spent on it. <br /> <br /> Sick, disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and lots of beer. Why can't people make more films like these? <br /> <br /> 8/10
