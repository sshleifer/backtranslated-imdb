the beauty of Clara's bow and the wonderful charm are the main reason for watching this film. "hula" is not quite up to the best of Clara's films, but it is still enjoyable. she dances, she rides her horse and chases the man she loves. this film is just over an hour long and was directed by the future Oscar winner Victor Fleming (gone with the wind). the film moves quickly and clara bow has a lot of time on the screen. if you like the clara, I would recommend "hula".
