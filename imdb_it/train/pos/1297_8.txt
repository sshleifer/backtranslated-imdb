Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel to a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something of the sort), who relies heavily on narration in the first person, but not for that. Downbeat (in a petty-bourgeois way), philosophical and witty, the best way to describe both the film and the novel is that it is something more intellectual than Charles Bukowski (not wanting to disrespect the CB). Bitingly funny, but also a squalid analysis of social and sexual relationships, the film's great success is that it reflects real life in a way that is so recognizable that you ask yourself: why are not other films like this? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes a film just as good.
