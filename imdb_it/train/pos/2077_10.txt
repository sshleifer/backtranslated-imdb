This timeless proverb resonates in this film and in my heart. So many years I waited to see this eternal story! I wasn't ready, maybe. It is possible that my sensitivity did not appreciate his power. So now I welcome him with gratitude in my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> Respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI have been long. His is now a legendary luminescence. But now I have finally discovered the priceless gifts of the splendid talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can they talk like his? Some said it was caused by his silent years, and this well may have been just his speech, he is quite eloquent when given a chance. He well deserved his Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film is in an epic in more classical proportions. All the same parts, necessary and perfect. The Naysayers can leave if they wish, but they would be challenging a storytelling that remains with a life. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in ways you don't expect. But all will not come from it with the joy that I did. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Don't produce me with mere technical aspects of the main players' race. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with absolute perfection. But I challenge a million new films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such intensity, power, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist would have the courage to re-film this masterpiece, I warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance that still emanates from the core of this story. Time will not diminish this effort, nor will it progress by improving its greatness.
