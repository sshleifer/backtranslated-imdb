The jokes are obvious, the gags are trivial, and the characters are walking incarnations - but I couldn't stop laughing at his very funny movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still have a kick from it, and I highly recommend it for all mindless entertainment lovers. It contains many quotable moments and some of the best gag views I've seen to date. If you've had a bad week and need a laugh, rent this on your way home Friday night to get your weekend off to a good start.
