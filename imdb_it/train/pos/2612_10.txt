This is a film that has been done very well. I had heard mixed reviews while he was in production and I was waiting for his release! Greetings to the director and to all the actors. The supporting cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to bring him to the top. As everyone else here states, the last part of the film is compelling. Katie Cassidy did a fantastic job with her character, since she hadn't done much work when this movie was shot. He has enough career ahead of her. I was stunned by his performance. I completely enjoyed the film, I questioned my values ​​in life and priorities and I am a better person for this! A great message lies in the film. Release it so everyone can have fun!
