A bus full of passengers is blocked during a snow storm. The police closed the bridge saying that it is not safe and they are stuck in a small cafe until the road has been cleaned. However, after a while, their boredom turns into worry, since it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and could only be an alien !! This leads to an ironic but also rather amusing conclusion in a way of dealing with the lines. <br /> <br /> This is another of the fun episodes of The Twilight Zone. Instead of typical twists or social comments, this does not present any lasting message. However, it is also very watchable, so who cares ?! Exactly what happens you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this sees John Hoyt - a face that many of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost all cases, he played a grumbler (like Charles Lane at the same time), but the boy enjoyed seeing him - as he perfected the grumpy person and was a little fun at the same time.
