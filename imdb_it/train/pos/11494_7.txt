The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such is bad and insipid. If you hate pregnant women, take a look at this movie because it's full of pre-killing and failed abortions. Brooke Adams plays Virginia. She and her husband team go to a fantasy fertilization clinic because they can't have children alone. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling has had a very high success rate in making couples pregnant. (Enter a joke here.) Is it because you're creating killer genetic supermutant babies? This is what Virginia starts thinking about when she starts having some strange side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment. That's when he starts taking things in his hands. <br /> <br /> On this, you will have to get the rest of the details somewhere else, because if I told you all the goodies you did you could hurt yourself by putting it on the Netflix rental queue too quickly. It's a little slow to move around for a while but once you recover in the third final, all the systems are gone! Very highly recommended by me on the strengths of his non-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.
