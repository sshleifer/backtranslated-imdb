I found this a very fun little baby movie that is actually more suitable for adults with lots of jokes and humor that only they would understand. Some things are inappropriate for children, but only a few. In any case, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) cracks up so many jokes that you can't keep up with everyone, from sexual to cultural, from insider-Hollywood to race. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks fantastic on DVD. The little one in here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really pretty and the costumes and hairstyles of the little people here are fun to watch. Even the voice of Anthony Hopkins is pleasant, so having his story this further elevates the film. His rhymes are fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, even though it was "nice", but on DVD, it was much better. I've seen it three times and it's improved every time.
