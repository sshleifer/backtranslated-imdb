This film is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I've ever seen. He does not try to tell the whole story, but only to interpret an interpretative expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. He is darkly witty, playful and seriously loyal to elements of the Jewish tradition and modern interpretation of the Scriptures. Judas is much more ordinary than other portraits, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but a gravely wrong man, horribly misled into his zeal. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed - very human while also divine. The final dialogue is meditated and serves as the kind of chatter that two powerful men could make when they have just committed an atrocity. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
