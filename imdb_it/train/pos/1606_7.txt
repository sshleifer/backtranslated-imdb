The "adult movie" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and it is still a better than average film, which is aging very well. Although the comic moments are lower than the rest, the film has a wonderful specificity (the Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to exchange characters or spectators. (For example, the mafia never appear in complication, but they never become grotesque like my great Greek marriage.) The secondary lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the main thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary films where their immediate value cannot be impressed by the producers and the big guys. I miss these scenes. Even the older characters are magnificent. The film takes its light and silent path to a conclusion. There is not a misplaced scene included anywhere to make some sphincter managers relax. Cage and Cher do a very nice job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck invokes old, ethnic and working New York, much like "Marty", except that Moonstruck is definitely less fussy.
