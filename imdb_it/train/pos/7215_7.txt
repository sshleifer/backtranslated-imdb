FULL OF SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> This is a rather fast and fun crime thriller based on the drama of Ira Levin on two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) who are plotting the murder of their rich wife (Cannon) to obtain ownership and insurance. The plot is successful, but Christopher Reeve as the youngest and least affirmed of the two writers decides to make a game from the real murder - with only slight changes in the details. Reeve allows Easthampton, Long Island, to become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for example. The rest of the drama plot is a dead gift and to tell the truth to Reeve it doesn't matter a little bit of gossip or even an investigation into the seemingly accidental death of Cannon. Increase revenue and his Warhol quotient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the playwright who makes mega-bomber whose last four productions have bombed and would like nothing more than to quietly return to work on a new game, perhaps with Reeve's input , which would redeem its reputation. He cannot allow Reeve's scandalous drama to be produced. Then, what else? - try to kill him. Eventually they end up killing each other, the manuscript is appropriate from their neighbor, psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and earns a million dollars by selling it on Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is production design. That multi-storey multi-room house with the big windmill at the top, located on nine of what must be the most precious hectares of the earth (Easthampton!) It would be a splendid series of excavations everywhere. You could not afford a tent for puppies in Easthamptom. The house is not excessively large or baroque in its decor. It is simply beautifully modest, even if it is a little neat for my taste, the kind of house so clean that you are afraid to get on the carpet often for fear of leaving a footprint. <br /> <br /> Next the acting could not be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are superb. Dyan Cannon gives a perfect performance like the anxious wife whose pants are so tight that they look like they were sprayed, which is ok given her heritage. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role as an affable but psychopathic killer. Irene Worth, like the neighboring psychic Helga, was somehow difficult to define, a mistake. Assuming that she - or someone like her - was needed for the plot, but, my God, that offensive snoop her character, going around and claiming, "I feel pain in zis woom!" I suppose, in order to make it a little more interesting, she got up in sweatshirts and a cap with bicycle blinders. Still, it's a nuisance from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> You must love Ira Levin's buttery dialogue. The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the play. "Because it's there, Sidney!" Reeve says, and Caine shouts, "Those are MOUNTAINS, not PLAY! The plays are not there until some holes are not written!" Great is also the call of Caine to the police after his wife died of fear, as expected. He behaves in a river of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and pleads for an ambulance to be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face takes on his usual placid expression, he blows his nose into his handkerchief and leaves, all business again. <br /> <br /> The climax, although appropriately ironic, is confused and noisy and full of artifice, devoid of the evil charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the previous scenes. The soundtrack is mainly composed of riffs with a light heart on the harpsichord, which adapt perfectly to the film. <br /> <br /> You'll probably like it.
