It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their kids having fun. I needed a subscription to NAMBLA. <br /> <br /> Based on the respected book by Thomas Rockwell, How To Eat Fried Worms begins as a story for children: moving to a new city. The new child, the fifth grade Billy Forrester, was once popular, but he has to start all over again. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who at 4 1/2 feet is a giant. <br /> <br /> Additional complications are the bully Joe. His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting. Antagonize children with the ring of death: a Crackerjack ring that is said to kill you if you punch yourself. But not immediately. No, the ring of death triggers a poison that kills you in the eighth grade. <br /> <br /> Joe and his axis of evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy sounds good, swearing he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them against Joe's face. Ewww! To win them, Billy reluctantly bets he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in a spicy sauce, crushed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is nicknamed an exotic name like "Radioactive Slime Delight", in which children finally experience their dream of heating microwaves in a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you have ever met me, you will know that I have an uncontrollable and cordial laugh. I felt like an insect exploding in a child who whines that his "jerk" hurts. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. Like a movie by the G-rated Farrelly brothers, it is both vomited and delicious. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also an experienced storyteller. To increase mail, worms must be consumed by 7.00pm. Also, Billy has a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With such precision, it draws on the insecurities of children and the tendency to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you were to hypercalade this film the way children do their dilemmas, you will see that it is essentially a war. Fighting freedom and freedom holders use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I felt comforted when two mothers who followed me looked at each other in bewilderment and agreed, "It was a great film." Well, now I won't have to register in any legal database.
