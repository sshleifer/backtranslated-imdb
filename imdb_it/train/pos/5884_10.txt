Really, I liked it. The premise was good, the story adapted to both respective series, and here's my favorite part. Maria and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like the others who become synonyms of a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or make possible meetings (A first example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge family"). Actually, Valerie was saying she would be excited to make another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be looking for another ... but if that doesn't work, then they can re-run this .
