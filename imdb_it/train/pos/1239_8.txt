I think the film was good enough, I'll add it to my "classic collection" after all this time. I think I saw other posters that reminded some more demanding people that it's still just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points defy the "logic", but many religious questions accepted "on the faith" fail to pass the odor test. If you accept the faith you subscribe to, you can certainly accept a movie. It's just me or others who have noticed that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same knife owned by Lamonte Cranston has had so many problems controlling "The Shadow". No mention in the trivia section for both films here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar for a donut is the same prop.
