I saw this film for the first time when it came out in 1994 and I saw it recently and it is STILL funny. I don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do it. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal conflicts within groups and members when they were separated (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). Also there were the wanna b, the accessible rappers who started to do the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams of C & C Music Factory, etc.). This film makes fun of all this in a way that looks like a real documentary. Kasi Lemmons interprets an interview that spends a year in the life of a fictitious group name rap N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the nerds and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an emerging rap group whose politics makes them controversial. The nice thing about this film is so coarse in its way of interpreting the hip-hop industry of the 80s and in this way it is fun, but if you know the rap of the 80s / 90s, you know how much of this stuff is However, alone, without the knowledge of hip hop, it is still a fun and entertaining film, and for all those who ask, yes, Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first parody either. fun and, in a sense, better than Spinal Tap How Spinal Tap is for heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is for Rap, and the songs are ready too.The DVD is full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
