This is a classic 80s action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular television programs is "The Running Man", where convicted criminals are hunted and killed for the entertainment of millions of people. It is set up as a game in which the audience votes for his favorite "stalkers", trained assassins who hunt and kill the unfortunate "competitors" of the show. Audience members also win prizes to correctly predict who will be killed by whom. And the guest is played by none other than Richard Fewson of Family Feud, whose experience in the game show makes him fit for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is chock full of classic Arnold one-liners, like his famous "I'll come back" right before you enter the arena. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "How about a light?" I could go on and on, but I don't want to ruin the film. It's a funny thing! <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether it was designed or not, this film is a great parody of today's "Reality TV" craze. There are already numerous programs that show people who endure pain and humiliation for spectator entertainment, and even court cases are transmitted for their "entertainment value". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit bottom, and it's a scary image. One can only hope that the networks have the good sense not to let it go so far. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
