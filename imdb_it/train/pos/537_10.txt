For me, A Matter of Life and Death is just that ... simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end it exudes class. It is stimulating, stimulating, a mirror of the post-war world and of relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply amazing and the effect of mixing the monochrome and the Technicolor to accentuate the different worlds works perfectly. The characters and the development of the plot are almost perfect and the attention to detail promotes an absolutely credible fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It's as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I could only have one film to keep and revise A Matter of Life and Death that movie would be.
