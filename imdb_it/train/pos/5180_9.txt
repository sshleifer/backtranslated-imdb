There is this private campsite in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among the founders, my parents had a site since 1965, and my two brothers have sites there now. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing to do directly with the film, endure me.) I've spent summers at Blueberry Hill since I was five when I was eighteen, and it's for people like me to whom this film speaks: those for whom a group of encampments in the woods was, as my girlfriend says, "the good and happy place". If you've never tried the lifestyle, the Indian Summer will probably be lost on you; don't worry It doesn't have a fast pace, it doesn't have fast cuts, plots are not the least twisted, it has no explosions, such dramatic tensions as the existing ones are mild, there are no A-list actors, there are no quick jokes just to show how the screenwriters are smart (apart from perhaps Kimberley Williams' killer line on how her boyfriend shouldn't "survive her toys". It's not the least of what this movie talks about, no more than The Godfather is a slasher movie only because it has a lot of gore on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is the exact opposite of Godfather. If you've experienced the lifestyle, watch this movie, read more, just do it. > <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 movie.
