*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and considered quite lively at the time, Douglas Sirk is the most colorful candy melodrama is still a wonderful thing. The plot is about the stories of an oil-deficient Texas dysfunctional family that includes elder brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, hurt and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a moving and violent performance and his slipped sister Marylee played in an extreme way by Dorothy Malone. Ms. Malone's performance is telegraphed through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which consist mainly of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in movies that first enters the eyes of a room. Now don't get me wrong, his performance to say the least is an absolute hoot, and it's one of the acting jobs of the supreme camp of the 50s. But it is also terrible, because she is as nice and attractive as Malone, she is not a very good actress, and she is not capable of subtly or shading. His performance is of a note. She manages to make an evil Mambo, and in a great montage, while the unloved dad played by the ever-skilled Robert Keith falls to his death climbing a staircase, Sirk mixes it with an almost crazy Malone who does an orgasmic dance while undressing. Stack, (which was supposed to win an Oscar) and Malone, (who won the award, but shouldn't have) are the real stars of the film, the ones who started all the hysteria, both sexual and moving, while the "real stars" of the film, Hudson & Bacall fade into gray and brown, which are the colors in which they are mainly in costume. Hudson, who was a better actor, then received Stack's childhood best friend and best friend, and the stalked love interest of Malone moaning and groaning on Rock through most of the film. But Hudson doesn't want any part of her, and instead he is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and nobody is happy for a long time. The Stack-Bacall wedding falls to pieces after a year, and Stack almost drinks from the oblivion because he thinks he's sterile, and he can't give Bacall a child to prove he is a man. Sirk, a very intelligent man with a long and fascinating career both in film and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-50s with a series of intense colorful "films for women" or melodramas. Although they have been adapted mainly from medical material or from junk material, in Sirk's hands they have become such masterpieces. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that led to playing in these films by filling the spaces of his large screen with characters who played their emotional lives among strange combinations of colors and lights, making the shadows believe and many miraculous reflections . In "Scritto" the characters always peek through windows, listen to doors or steal around. So in the end, after a lot of violence, an accidental murder, an abortion and more Sirk concludes the film with a final and surprising scene of a "reborn" and reformed Malone in a tailored suit, sitting at a desk that pokes a miniature well.
