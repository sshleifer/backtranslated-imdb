If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have had any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, "Real American" side of America, the Riding Giants will strike more deeply than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is "unreal", an easy term, if ever there is one, but extremely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning - it's a 100% real documentary, but with everything the drama of an opera, and the completely apparent sense of love, expert and wise instilled by the direction and narration of Stacy Peralta, this film takes you from a great wave to a great wave while leaving you completely conquered by all this which you are given the privilege of seeing. <br /> <This film is a symphony, created as well as Beethoven 9th, which starts magnificently with its prelude to Hawaii, pulling human emotions to the bottom in Santa Cruz and ending with a sensation, triumph and growing in the feats of Laird Hamiltons , always in Hawaii. br /> <br /> Like classical music; like the 9th of Beethoven, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this could be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
