I have to admit that I'm a big fan of South Park and I expected basketball to be fun, but nowhere was it as good as it turned out! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This film has so much replay value and at no time does it bother to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor combined with Stone and Parker works perfectly. The kind of humor in Basketball was not popular at the time of its release and if it came out today it would be a success. Don't worry about trying to be critical, just leave the brain at the door and wait for endless laughs. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
