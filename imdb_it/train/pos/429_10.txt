It's been about 50 years since a movie was made about romance and mysticism. The only two films I can imagine are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used wonderful actors and not stars. In both films, all the actors gave their best romantic interpretations. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after the First World War who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation. It's incredible that "Enchanted April" was released in 1992. It stands out as a fun classic.
