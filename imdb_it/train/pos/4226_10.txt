I have a lot of time for all Columbo films, but this one in particular was very well written and the solution was very effective in the end. However, my main memory of this is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the murderer (I apologize if I didn't remember every detail of this exactly). It is the most impressive image of Columbo that I have seen: the view is from within the darkness of the belief in which the victim was killed, and in the room beyond, illuminated by daylight. Columbo is sitting in an armchair with a high back in front of the door (and us), contemplating the wardrobe and almost in silhouette because of the contrast of light. There is no sound. The camera slowly moves out of the room and towards him. He is deeply immersed in meditation, gently blowing on a cigar, whirls of smoke from the cigar that slowly rotate upward as he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Superb.
