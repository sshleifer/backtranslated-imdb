While the premise of the film is rather lame (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is a small amiable and amusing film. It's also a bit better than the films they made after this - probably because this was the last film produced by Laurel and Hardy produced by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see ANY of their latest films, since the whole chemistry is lost in these films and the boys only play their parts for pathos - something that the real Laurel and Hardy films would NEVER do. They had a bit of an advantage over all subsequent films. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work in a horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly with the whole racket, Ollie is going to have a nervous breakdown and has to take a break from work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film with the team) recommends a trip to the ocean. However, they don't like to sail and Stan has the idea of ​​renting a boat tied to the pier - so they can get all the sea air they want without the slightest hassle! Once they are on the boat, a dangerous escaped criminal embarks on the boat and everyone accidentally heads for the sea. Fortunately, this part of the film was actually well paced and the end worked very well. <br /> <br /> Although not a great feature film by Laurel and Hardy, it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers (as in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). Furthermore, there is still a fair amount of physical comedy - something that hardly anyone will see after this movie. A part of this was due to the decline in the health of the boys (and to the increase in the length of Ollie) and a part of it was due to the general insipidity of these last films.
