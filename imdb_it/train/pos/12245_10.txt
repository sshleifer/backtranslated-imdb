This is the best Emma in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and I read the book, I think I can safely say that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece. Even the 1996 film with G. Paltrow is good, it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether. It is very light and fluffy, you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a nice movie, that would be fine, but the complexity of some points in the plot, like the Churchill / Fairfax plot is so highly disguised as to be practically non-existent. But if you want the characters to be a little more real, more real and multidimensional, the 1996 TV version is the best. Emma is an extraordinary person, but she is imperfect. Kate Beckinsale is masterful in showing the little oddities of the character. You see her looking disgusted with someone from the simpler conversation of Harriet Smith, yet she shows no remorse for ruining Harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her marital happiness in the end. You see his narcissism and it mirrors that of Frank Churchill in that they would harm others to achieve their goals. For Emma, ​​she played with the matchmaker and had a new friend to spend time with after suffering the loss of her housekeeper at the wedding. For Frank Churchill, he is assuring the promise of the woman he loves while he treats her and others abominably to keep the secret. In the book, she understands all this in an overwhelming awakening to all the mistakes she made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse, but Paltrow's is more childish and stagnant while Beckinsale's awakening is quite real and serious and we see the shift from childish, selfish to gentle and caring adult behavior. Both versions are very good but I prefer this one.
