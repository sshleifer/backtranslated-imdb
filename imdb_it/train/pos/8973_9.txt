I saw this film when I was a child on television (thanks Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares for years afterwards. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislav Pojar, one of the Canadians The best animators of the National Film Board. Pojar was, in turn, a mentor and collaborator of the great Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is obvious, but cleverly used. The oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are put in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is doomed despite the lack of a political agenda. <br /> <br /> What reminded me the most was the feeling of oppression in the furniture. The small room where the action takes place is the whole world of the character. Invasion by hand is a complete violation of that world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and disturbing movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful Trnka courts in the public library and showed it to my children. A must see
