When Paris is Burning came out, I completely rejected it. I was not in all the Madonna and the vogueing phenomenon. I thought it would be campy and silly. How wrong I was with this movie. I watched it after the film had been out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It brought me back to a moment and a place of fun and excitement. I seemed to know all the characters personally. The 1980s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a fantastic job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original cast members were doing but couldn't find them all. If anyone has any information on any of the cast members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another documentary. I loved him
