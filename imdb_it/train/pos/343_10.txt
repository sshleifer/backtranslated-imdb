Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this movie was about, these names were enough to attract me. Splendid, talented and popular, these are artists not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Ok, where do I start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls were targeted by a "romantic" serial slasher, a boy who all refused at the school dance 13 years ago. His brands include thin mortuary threats disguised as Valentine's cards, worm-infested chocolates and a bloody nose. His favorite weapon: well, take a pickaxe, a knife, an electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a bizarre sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies shouldn't be Shakespeare, but I won't go. I love horror movies, but not all. This, I love. It's up there with some of my other favorites. It's fun, sexy and scary. The assassin's mask is childishly creepy and to see a cupid shoot a bow and an arrow to a victim is really strange. The acting is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very funny. I really wanted to see much, much more than Katherine Heigl. I'm one of his biggest fans and I'd like to see you at work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress and Jessica Cauffiel plays the blond dribble role she perfected in Urban Legend 2. Even the smallest parts were good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ("bleedmedry.com") and that younger version of Denise Richards looked frighteningly similar to her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: every scene of death had a particular distinction. The most disturbing is the opening scene in the morgue. The spicy scene, while ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was sinister. The soundtrack is fantastic, with creepy music and some refined alternative melodies. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I have the impression that the killer was not described well enough, we barely saw the mask, and it was not present at all during the climax. I also thought that the climax was really blurry, but still fun. <br /> <br /> The blow at the end was not a big surprise, but I'm really glad that the directors decided to spare us everything 'explaining the killer routine'. <br /> <br /> I don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to choose a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing, then Valentine would be it. <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
