In 1955, five years after this was published, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed six other films together, four of them Western. Their relationship was evident from the beginning and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic. Fans of the period will have fun in the fact that the top ten names of the credits were all more than known - and that doesn't count Ray Teal or "Anthony" Curtis, who later becomes Tony. Perhaps ten years after the "psychological" western was well entrenched but in the 1950s it was rare to launch Achab in the mix with Cain and Abel, not to mention many other problems along the way, and still provide a conventional Western on the surface and full credit to all interested parties. One to add to the DVD collection.
