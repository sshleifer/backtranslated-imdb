True, the idea of ​​this television series could have sprung from the immense success that Ally McBeal is enjoying all over the world, even here in Germany. However, this said, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work beautifully together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by a famous German actor, Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, get it ???), played by the charming Rebecca Immanuel, exchange quick romantic answers and espionage I continue to mutually engage in sitcom-like criminal cases in and around Berlin. Furthermore, they are helped by a magnificent cast of co-stars, in particular their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, who is a rare gem with great comic potential. Even the shady wheel seller, Otto, and Felix's noble childhood friend, Frank, work very well, not to forget Sandra's best friend and roommate, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> All in all a joy to watch on Mondays: no wonder the series and its stars have received numerous awards. Felix will take Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
