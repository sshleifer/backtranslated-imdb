This movie is a lot of fun. I've seen it a couple of times, but I always have something funny that I remember. The "duckies and bunnies" car scene is one of my favorites, and I still quote versions of certain Morone words! <br /> <br /> There are so many jokes in the running, which is incredible. But I love Michael Keaton anyway!
