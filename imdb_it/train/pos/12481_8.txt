OK, so I don't watch too many horror movies - and the reason is films like "Dark Remains". I took this (a surprisingly feature rich DVD) and it scared me stupidly. In fact, the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a new pair of pants. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I was telling someone about it when I realized I had only seen about 10% of it. The rest of the time I was watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would take me if I really covered my eyes. The few times I challenged the screen I jumped so hard that I decided not to look again. <br /> <br /> The making of the film is solid and the situation of the characters was really compelling. The simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button - it's simply a wood, a cabin and a disused prison - and a LOT of darkness. The most surprising thing for me was the fact that even though it was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the effects of the make-up really did seem like it! Furthermore, it is obvious that this is a film made by someone with a great love for cinema. Sound design and music have really made use of my surround system as many Hollywood movies have never done. I noticed online that this film won the LA Shriekfest - a really important achievement, and I think the festival has seen the clear talent of the directors - and probably a lot more than this film has managed to do. <br /> <br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the lights and, if you want to keep your girlfriend, order a pizza.
