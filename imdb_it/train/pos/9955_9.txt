I saw this movie twice in community screenings and loved it. I work in the community of Jane Finch and I feel that the film has really captured part of the essence and flavor of the community: determination, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your face with a dose of desperation. Writing, dialogue and acting are solid and I really found myself involved in the story of the young Raya woman as she struggles to pursue her goals and not get lost in the process. Great dance sequences and it's not just the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multidimensional - none of them completely good or bad and the female characters are admirably strong. This film has a strong heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of young people, hip hop and community like Jane Finch.
