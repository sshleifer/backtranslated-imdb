If you want a serious laugh, watch this movie and the things that Bruce inflicts on his fellow journalist. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original film. It can't be because of the weather, since the film is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been neglected for too long. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
