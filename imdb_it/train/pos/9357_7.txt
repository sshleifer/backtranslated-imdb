In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) by chance meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) on the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan has trouble discussing his most intimate feelings with his wife. Alan regains his friendship with Charlie and they approach each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life by sending him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to treatment and is sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Reign Over Me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is practically impossible to recognize, I don't know if she uses excessive tricks to look bigger, but her face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
