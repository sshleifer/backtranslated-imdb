Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever invented. To win money you have to be INTELLIGENT. Not only that you have to be brave, athletic, astute, etc. It actually requires skill. Not like some loser shows these days. Still, they only have two seasons! Bull ... they need to bring this show back !! <br /> <br /> Although, they will struggle to snatch Anderson Cooper from CNN. It was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was an incredible show. You never knew who would go when. And it was a lot of fun trying to figure out the mole alone! It was a show where you could really play alone if you wanted to! <br /> <br /> BRING THE MOLE !!!! BRING THE MOLE !!!!
