If you like "Otello", you will love this movie because half of the film revolves around the theatrical production of the comedy. <br /> <br /> The film has an exceptional cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colman's Life while Edmond O'Brien plays the enterprising press agent. <br /> <br /> A couple of supportive players that I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell as the graying reporter who finds a corner and Joe Sawyer, the 1940s response to Drew Carey, who plays the cop on the case. <br /> <br /> Great raw moments in this with noir realism in everything.
