When I rented Domino I expected him to be very stupid. I hate movies that have really flashy editing and cinematography, and Domino has also had negative reviews. The only reason I looked at it is because I liked having Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also have fun based on adventure stories. Yes, editing and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this movie for some strange reason. Domino was very, very funny and often very funny. It was terribly undervalued when it was released, I guess because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like the last Scotts Man on Fire movie and instead they only have wonderful entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved it and recommend it.
