Another Downey must see! If you're a fan obsessed like me, you have to watch this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate who realizes that the life he has just entered is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, an absurd lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car. He asks to go back, only this time in Alex Finch's body. Enter Robert Downey Jr., much confusion and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this film is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as reincarnation. And if so, how often do you meet the same souls life after life. I do not know the answer. But I know you need to see this movie. It's a revolt, and Downey looks SO GOOD in a tuxedo. This film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It is simply recycled.
