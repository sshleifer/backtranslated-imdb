This show is really hilarious! the jokes are original, god and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the eighth season it's no longer fun because Eric and Kelso are no longer on the show, and Randy is a real idiot. Randy is, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> you can't take the funniest characters and swap them for the "I'm a nice guy" type (Randy). it's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the eighth season fun, it's still not as much as the previous seasons, but that's fine. <br /> <br /> the 360s are fantastic, the Cerchia, Red is a real kind of father who mentally abuses :) and the kitten is always half a half high cake. Hyde tries to always be cool, he also has his moments. the less fabulous characters are Jackie and Donna. they are fantastic, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> great show. Idiot!
