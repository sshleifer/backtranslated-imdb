This is one of the best shorts of "Our Gang" of all time. Spanky is very cute and funny, and even the children who are left to babysit are hilarious. Tiny Spanky is forced by the gang to watch all their little brothers. The opening blow of all of them in wheelchairs, being entertained by various things hanging from the band from fishing rods is a beautiful gag. <br /> <br /> Spanky's appearance wears his huge toy knife when he is asked to babysit the older ones is priceless, as is his answer - "Hey, where do you get that stuff - I don't take care of no child! " The little guy who says "remarkable" throughout the film, all the beautiful gags of the view, and Spanky who tells the kids "all about Tarzan" add up to make this one of the best "Our Gangs" you've ever seen.
