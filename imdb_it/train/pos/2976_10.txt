For a comedy he has a decent and inventive plot and Trey Parker and Matt Stone have perfect comic timing. There are dozens of fun moments in this awesome movie. I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash takes place in the sports scenes. The parody of Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries is also a lot of fun.
