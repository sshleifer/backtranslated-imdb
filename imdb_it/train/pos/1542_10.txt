well done by giving the other side's perspective, the traulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent acting especially when the German high command refuses in the name of the cavalry to present the ordered kaiser medal struck. the carnage scenes are probably too intense for the minds of the United States who would probably prefer silly speeches and meaningless abstractions like 14 points or the League of Nations. true Americans could appreciate the plot and the action. for all the action and intrigue, the fraulein doktor compares honeycomb (u) to Jacob's Ladder.
