Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle movie. It has all the pieces of acting, direction, plot and entertainment value. They all fit together and when they are made they create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This film follows a single mother Fay Grim who tries to raise her son to not become his father who runs away from the law and disappeared. Soon the CIA contacts Fay in a desperate search to find 8 her husband Henry's diaries. These diaries were full of confessions about his long history in the CIA and his involvement with countries and their government actions. Fay is sent to look for these diaries, in exchange for freeing his brother from prison, and is sent to hunt cats and mice throughout Europe to retrieve these journals and learn about the hidden secrets of his husbands he never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey had already been an actress that I liked after seeing her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. He brought these two comic roles to life, but Fay Grim was a very different role than the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I rooted for her and wanted to know more. It grabs you while it's on the screen and when it's out you can't stop thinking about what's happening to you. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other previous work by writer / director Hal Hartley but I think I will try to see some of his previous films if they are half good by Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to choose a smart movie the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD, I highly recommend choosing Fay Grim. If you have a good sense of how a movie should be, you will love this movie immensely.
