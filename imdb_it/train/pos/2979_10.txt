There's not much to say about this movie ... it's raw, but fun. <br /> <br /> Plot outline (From IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invent a new game by playing to basketball, using the rules of baseball. When the game becomes a huge success, together with the help of a billionaire, they form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone receives the same salary and no team can change cities. The Coop & Remer team, the Milwaukee Beers is the only team that is hindering major changes to the rules that the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) owner wants to set up. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> The Acting is pretty good, since there aren't many big stars in this movie. Although not a big fan of "Southpark", Parker and Stone do a good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun moments in this movie that I can't get close to naming them all. He never really gives up, and they don't try to put some dramatic drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated. <br /> <br /> Overall, a raw film, but extremely fun. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
