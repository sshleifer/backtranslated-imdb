According to John Ford's lyrical shot, an imaginary biopic of the life of Abraham Lincoln, his biggest flaws could have been obtuseness with the woman and the ability to dance in "the worst way". Ford's camera has only praised the opinions to reveal Mr. Lincoln's initial life. But for what the film lacks in the complexity of the character, it compensates for its beauty and depth of vision. Unusually beautiful compositions from the first film, which could have been a series of splendid frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. The film sings the life of a promising young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously intelligent Lincoln in a T-shirt, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film is about two young brothers, on trial for a murder they both claim to have committed. In the classic style of the enraged crowd, the city decides to take justice into its own hands and lynch the pair, until honest Abe gets into the fray. He fascinates them with his humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys' lawyer. What follows seems to become the outline of all the homicide-drama courts from then on, while Abe cleverly questions witnesses for the joy and humor of the judge, the jury and the city before he stumbles upon the missing links. <br /> <br /> The film takes place like many films by John Ford: a spoonful of Americana, a hint of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that one is not sure if the recipe is entered or if Ford did by himself. Despite the film's overtly "Hollywood" feel, and the patriotic jokes that allude to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is entirely enjoyable and well-built, if you can bring your drama with a pinch of salt.
