"Father is still away on business" was the title of a review after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many people think that the same but unique expression of Kusturica is still present in his new film and is something for which critics cannot touch it. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it is still unique and pristine. Surprisingly good performance by Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and fewer landscapes then in "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a potential femme fatale worldwide, please don't ruin it. Surely, I recommend everyone to see this movie.
