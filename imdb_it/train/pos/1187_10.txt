The Last Hunt is the classic forgotten Hollywood western. The theme of genocide through the massacre of buffaloes is present in other films, but never so wildly. The counter-type role of Robert Taylor as the bison possessed and the Indian killer is his best interpretation. In the 50s, your mother left your friends with you on the Saterday scene, usually with a western or a comedy. But it was wrong then and now to let a young man look at psychodramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why didn't the mother censor these films? Because they have featured "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climate scene of The Last Hunt is as terrifying as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The mythology of the white buffalo, part of the plot of this film, was later torn away from other films including The White Buffalo, with Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians. <br /> <br /> Today a large herd of remaining bisons resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In winter, hunger forces surplus animals out of the park towards Montana, where they are sometimes collected by Idaho's Nez Perce Indians under a right-wing treaty of the United States dating back to Lincoln's presidency. Linclon signed the Congress Act which authorized the continental railway and began the massacre of buffaloes.
