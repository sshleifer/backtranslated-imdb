I was lucky enough to watch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially William Castle tricks, so this was definitely a must for me. <br /> <br /> It is the life and work of William Castle, which I believe was an underrated director. True, he made some schlocky horror films, but added something to these films: real live tricks that are no longer seen. For example, he had nurses if someone had a heart attack on his films and put vibrators on the backs of THE TINGLER chairs. <br /> <br /> This is truly a well-made documentary and takes this director rather in the shade and celebrated his contributions to horror movies. He also paints Castle as a character larger than life, who was very popular and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the documentaries that show above all the wills of film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mostly from members of his family and directors who have been influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. A must see for classic horror and science fiction fans.
