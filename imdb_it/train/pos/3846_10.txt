after all, I like Verhoeven's film because in his film I enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that I saw before in "Basic Instinct". It really is a wonderful thriller that I really enjoyed. So it's obvious that I watch this other Verhoeven movie. <br /> <br /> well, it's his previous direction before his block buster hit "Basic Instinct" and that's why I was very curious to see that movie and yes, the film met my hope and expectation. <br /> <br /> this movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama that is a bit complex for some audiences. the story of this film is about a gay writer named "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic person who lives by his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that could warn him of a future accident. After the end of his lesson, he presents a seductive woman named "Christine", who has a mysterious past that he does not want to reveal. Before having sex with her in her home while she is a child. The next morning, look at his sexy, macho boyfriend photo on his table, the person he met at the station. He is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to his house. <br /> <br /> that's all. I don't want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really amazing! <br /> <br /> in particular, I like the "Reve" character who is brilliantly played by "Krabbe" Basically I like his acting because as a gay I am identified only with his character and yes, I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr. Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. <br /> <br /> vote this movie: 10 out of 10.
