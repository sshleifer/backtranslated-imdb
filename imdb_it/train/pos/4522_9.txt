This took me by surprise because I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he caught the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both farce and pathos while offering real humor and emotions. The always wonderful Julie Waters is fantastic here, and anyone who hasn't shown it yet in the 1983 Education Rita should rent it immediately (wonderful movie). Even the rest of the supporting characters are well interpreted, many wonderfully eccentric without exaggerating. This is fun.
