One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. An entertaining, satirical film, attentive buyers driving a new home. <br /> <br /> Full of great characters that everyone, Cary Grant is convinced of, are willing to let him wear in his dream home. br /> <br /> A great look at life in the late 1940s. <br /> <br />
