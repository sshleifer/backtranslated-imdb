'The Last Wave' is much more than the sum of its parts. It is not simply a catastrophic film, it is not simply an exploration of Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than just court drama. Writer / director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and inspiring film, with the same eerie atmosphere he gave "Picnic At Hanging Rock" two years earlier, which you will continue to remember years later. <br /> <br /> When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) for the death of an aboriginal man for whom he may or may not be directly responsible, he finds himself not only fighting for get Lee's truth, but make sense of what he feels when he arrives. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the daily and the Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with more disastrous ramifications than Burton could ever have imagined. <br /> <br /> No doubt the reason why 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is remembered better is because of its enduring mystery. We are guided along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves. In "The Last Wave", we can put it all together at the end of the film. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the boundaries of our normal realities. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses his impressive budget, gradually building up a sense of ruin in everything from soft lighting, heavy rain, to good use of sound. Incidental music is discreet, never trying to be great. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the bewilderment that the public would undoubtedly have felt while trying to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil excellently interprets a man trapped between two worlds, who want to do the right thing, but is afraid because he already knows the ending. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir has been a household name in cinema for thirty years onwards. Strongly recommended.
