I remember when I first saw this short, I was actually laughing so hard that, like many other movies I saw, no sound came out! Curly is really good at "singing" the opera in this, I'm surprised he didn't consider a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed, this film was shot towards the end of Curly's career as Stooge, you could really say that he had changed, because he had lost weight and was thinner, his voice was deepening, his face was lined with wrinkles, even if he could still pull it out, he looked like he was fifty years old at forty. This was due to the fact that he was suffering many minor blows before his great that ended his career. He'll still be able to get him out of his last! <br /> <br /> If you don't mind the fact that Curly was really getting sick at this point, this is actually one of their most entertaining short films. I know I didn't mind the fact that Curly was really changing, because I still thought it was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
