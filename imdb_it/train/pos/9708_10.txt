I've never seen this program before, although it was highly recommended by my family members. Strangely, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the filming location) and she pointed out some landmarks when I visited for the first time. <br /> <br /> This led me to take an interest, so I bought the first series on video and sat down watch. In addition to recognizing some of the places, I am not surprised at all. Once again the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the most beautiful comedy in the world. TLOG is easily placed there with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I am passionate about the program now. The characters are superb and show an unusual depth while retaining a frighteningly realistic margin. The graphic aspect of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (do not disrespect Hadfield that I found a very welcoming and warm place). I just hope he continues his originality during his run (which was based on the second series that ended his UK replay last night, certainly it is). <br /> <br /> The BBC is well done !!
