The fake journey of Bill and Ted is the most excellent film I've ever seen. Even if the acting and the landscape are scarce, who cares. The plot is brilliant and the lines and words that come out are excellent, even the ideas are great. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best part is obviously when you 'melvin' death, I was bursting for 10 minutes and I lost the next part of the movie. This is much better than the first, which was just as nice. Perhaps the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the film are anyway when Bill and Ted are excellent and play the guitar solo, it was exhilarating. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen bring out a third movie !!
