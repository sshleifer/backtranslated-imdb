Guys and Dolls must be one of my favorite music films of all time. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. embodies what people have forgotten about musicals: musicals are meant to entertain, not to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good films, but they can't bring us solid entertainment without constraints. The only thing that bothered me in the film was Marlon Brando, the boy can't sing! It was very annoying to hear him sing and talk when I couldn't understand him. If it wasn't for Marlon, I would have given this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offers old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely have these days. Watch it for fun !!
