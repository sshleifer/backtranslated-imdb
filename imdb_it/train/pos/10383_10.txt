I saw this film in 1976, my first year in New York. I continued to live there for the next 26 years, but I've never seen anything as delicate and beautiful as this little TV movie. I remember it was part of a PBS series and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, only delicate, moving moments, extraordinarily moving full of tension and excitement, all set in a conservative environment, in Boston (I believe), in the First World War , where women played the role of the devoted wife awaiting the return of the husband from the war, and did not seek a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is superb in her role as a professional photographer and I spent the next 30 odd years looking for her in equally difficult roles with no result. <br /> <br /> Should there be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD but certainly at least one video?
