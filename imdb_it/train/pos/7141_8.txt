After Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show was left in the incapable hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic, but only criticizes what he does not like personally, so country music films are cut short because "I don't like country music!" and children's films receive a standard "Don't see it now, wait until it goes out on DVD and entrust it to your children!" Roeper could be an idiot savant, but in some other field. Weekly guests "sitting" for Ebert are better, but who wants to take a daisy in the middle of a cow pat? That being said, it's the only show in the city and it's worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, you too can! It is your mind and the thoughts we desire. Do whatever it takes to free that usurper from his self-declared throne.
