If your idea of ​​a thriller is car chases, explosions and dozens of people cut down by gunfire, then "House of Games" is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate the psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of a respected psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the dark world of the men guided by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). Saying more about the plot would ruin the suspense. Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who claims to have seen the twists and turns coming. Just like an astute scam artist, this movie pulls you into its web and lulls your vigil. <br /> <br /> The plot is tense and well thought out, the dialogue is intelligent and laconic, the acting uniformly good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic). Some complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why Mamet would have made Lindsay Crouse so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford should be cold and aloof; furthermore, his familiarity is in an essential way for the plot (at some point, I believe that an injury to his sexual self-esteem is a fundamental part of his motivation ... I will say no more). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a dark look on the underside of human nature that ends on a note of ambiguous unease. He will keep your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you long afterwards.
