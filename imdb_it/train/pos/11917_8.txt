Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. The end when the whole crowd at the stadium gets up and people raise their hands gives me a thrill every time I see it. It's simply brilliant. Joseph is as wonderful as the lonely and sad child who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is fun and hilarious. A very nice family film with - I concede - a rather silly happy ending. But hey, it doesn't matter, the film maintains its basic quality from good acting and inspirational themes.
