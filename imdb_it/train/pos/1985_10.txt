I'm not usually a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose which one would be my favorite it would definitely be Oliver. This film is so well done, the characters are well represented, the costumes are perfect and the acting is good, they are great, my favorite is' Review of Ron Moody's situation which gives a brilliant portrait of Fagin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when he was released in the late 1960s, but my sisters were, so for weeks and weeks I had to endure them while they sang bloody songs, usually it was "Who will buy my wonderful roses", so I already knew all the songs before I saw the movie. It's a timeless musical that you couldn't possibly do again, it's not accurate for the book and I don't think it would have worked so well if it was. I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as Oliver wrote to describe poverty in London, orphanages , the workhouses and on what the poor had to resort to survive, and the film portrays is another good reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old Bull Terrier type English, notice his long thin legs, that was bred out of the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and it is exactly like an English Bull terrier would have looked in the Victorian era. Noting that he has scars on his face, Bill Sykes probably used him to fight dogs or for the pit of mice. A Victorian Terrier bull has had a record amount of killings in a rat pit. He is a beautiful dog in every way, and he noticed that he disobeys Bill Sykes after killing Nancy, obviously he has his standards he is not the boss of what Bill Sykes thought. great musical to watch if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals make an attempt in any way, there's something for everyone in this movie.
