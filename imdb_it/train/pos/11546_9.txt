Absolute first sight: 21 July 2008 <br /> <br /> Very impressive screenplay and comedy acting and timing in this film. Now he is 40, he has lost none of his power. Neil Simon shows an excellent vision of human nature and relationships, as well as how to create a genuine comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedy shows. Neil Simon was inspired by real life events to write the comedy on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and performed Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, he was nominated for only 2 Academy Awards: "Best Screenplay Adaptation" and "Best Film Editing". Hollywood rarely assigns comedies, no matter how they were created.
