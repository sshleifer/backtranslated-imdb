I saw this movie for the first time when it was broadcast around 1988 by the BBC when I was working in the 2000AD in the UK. My friend Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up to this point, I had only seen Shaw Bros' Kung Fu movies, with their harsh lights (so the audience could clearly see the moves), so it was a revelation for me to see something that seemed to be lit up by Ridley Scott leaves Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to Tsui Hark's films (apparently pronounced "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> Yet for all the smoky, backlit exteriors and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong film?) In the heart of the Chinese GHOST STORY there is a simple and moving love story , made even more real by Leslie Cheung's exceptional acting talent (what a tragedy, tragic loss of life!) and by the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Granted Joey is gorgeous, but it's his hand gestures that give his character an unattainable eroticism that is difficult to analyze. And even though Joey is almost 20 now (gawd, which of us is not?) This will always be that actress's lasting image. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers have said the film is simplistic and Lacks some surprises, but they lack the fact that this film was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and simply copy WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to pull it out of my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, the story of Chinese ghosts is the epitome of romantic history. It has a high tragedy, because we know that Chios Sin and Sin Visa will never be able to be together. It's about becoming mature, because none of us can mature until we have experienced a great loss. It is about sacrifice, because sacrifice is an essential component of true love. And Wu Ma's comic style doesn't hurt a bit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the GHOST HISTORY of the Chinese trying not to see it through a filter of Western culture and you will get along well.
