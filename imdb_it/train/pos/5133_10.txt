Each of the major studios has staged jazz musicians on one side in the 1930s and 1940s (with Universal taking the lead). Although most seemed cheap on the screen as they should have done, Warner Bros. (which suddenly stopped making them in 1946) often distinguished them with angles, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors like Jean Negulesco. It is good that the best of this kind should come from this study. <br /> <br /> What sets "Jammin 'The Blues" apart from the rest of the pack is that it looks more like a cutting-edge experiment than a Hollywood musical. Shot in July 1944, it turns a normal jam session into a "dreamlike" escape from wartime wars, underlined by the "On the sunny side of the road" motif. Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later working with Hitchcock) had a lot of artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and he could care less about how he and his fellow musicians were presented. The optical printer is put to use with the simultaneous display of several images of the same performer. (Norman McLaren really milked this process two decades later in "Pas De Deux", while Linwood Dunn's team got several effects in "Citizen Kane".) The strong emphasis on silhouettes and on cigarette smoke was also in advance on the times; in a sense, this preceded the psychedelic sixties, but with a decidedly noir noir style.
