In these days Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is largely remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. What is even more alarming is that Spielberg himself has not even been named as the best director. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserved more support than they were accorded. <br /> <br /> The story is about the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her violent husband. The film lasts several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It is told from a decidedly feminine perspective, but we must not fear that this is a film for girls 'sweetened'. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, sometimes lively with humor, even if the battles of the central character are fundamental. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the end of the film, but I didn't mind even though similar content in a minor film would probably have to make me roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (best actress), Oprah Winfrey (best supporting actress) and Margaret Avery (best supporting actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly worthy and Danny Glover was inexplicably stiff. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg has not received a nomination as best director for his efforts. This omission begs beliefs, since Spielberg's direction here is first-rate. I'm not particularly crazy about the Quincy Jones soundtrack, but it's not below average in any way. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is satisfying, well told by a master filmmaker working at Pulitzer's award-winning Material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as stunned as I am about how it could be treated so badly on Oscar night.
