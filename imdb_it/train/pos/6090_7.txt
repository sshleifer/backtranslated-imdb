envy isn't as fun as I thought it would have been initially, but after some of the reviews I read I found it was a lot more fun than people were giving the props, now it's true it's not a gag a movie minute like zoolander or dodgeball, but even quieter and black jack work well with each other and christopher walken is fantastic as always, so the story is about the character of Jack Black who invents a spray that makes the dog disappear, and obviously he doesn't want to be part of it, but when the product does jack black rich well stiller he starts to see envy, it's not at all beautiful and both well stopped and black jack have more fun and better films under the belt, but if you are a fans of both I recommend this as a still funny movie and I laughed a few times, since a big Ben Stiller fan must say that this is a minor damping but still a lot of fun, give him a watch
