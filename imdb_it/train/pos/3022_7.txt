I never understood that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) appeared together with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together. Even Peter Lorre, (Contreras) had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that made him faint. This story deals with a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish civil war and tries to interrupt a coal mining contract that will cause serious damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard collecting it and at the same time falls in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry mob of English miners who threaten his life. The real villain in this film is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers" which offers an exceptional performance. Great 1945 classic film without Humphrey Bogart.
