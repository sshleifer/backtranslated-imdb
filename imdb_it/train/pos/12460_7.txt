The goodbye friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves is not perfect, but it is a clean and fun thriller that sees the veteran French war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same vault of the basement, one to return the stolen securities, the other to clean up the two million salaries sitting there during the Christmas weekend. Of course things are not so simple even after they have opened the vault, leading to twists and turns. On the debt side, there is a very bizarre striptease scene in a parking lot, Bronson has a very annoying gale similar to Fonzie he uses in the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, showing off perhaps the most horribly wrong hairstyle of the 60s makes it look like a bald woman whose wig is pulled back from the top of her head by a strong wind), is it something of a responsibility ?? she "I'll cook spaghetti, I'll learn to make love well, I'll read Shakespeare!" the speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways ?? and it's a shame about the horrible last row / recovery, but otherwise it's a surprisingly fun and unpretentious number that is worth checking out if you can find a decent print. <br /> <br /> The Cinema Club UK DVD only offers English soundtrack, but since Delon speaks for himself and the rest of the cast is fairly well nicknamed, it's not much of a problem, especially because widescreen transfer is pretty good quality.
