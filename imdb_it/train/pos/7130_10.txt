Well, when I wasn't sure if it would be my cup of tea before seeing this movie ... what a mistake I had! I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time, a true family classic. The story of a displaced young man and his new adoptive father, this film scans all the boxes. I didn't read the book (maybe it's a good thing and it means that I liked the film the most) but as far as the story goes, I really can't think of negative points, so I score 10 out of 10 (and hardly ever think you deserve top marks!). The moment William declared "I CAN RIDE MY BIKE, DAD!" I was sobbing my heart (whoever saw it will understand, I'm sure). Really moving, and definitely recommended.
