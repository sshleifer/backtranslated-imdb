Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. Despite having a slow start, the story is so incredibly complex and delicate to be together rather well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard, called Creasy who is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up his duty to save his last protégé, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very intelligent and enthusiastic girl who loves so many things, and acts very convincingly, has a great future ahead of her. As I said, the story is rather complicated, to fully understand it, you have to watch it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> This film is made in two parts, there is the first hour, where everyone is happy, there is nothing wrong, everyone lives their lives happily until the kidnapping takes place of Pita and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there is the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy recovered from the serious injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and "La Hermamdad" who were responsible planning and execution of Pita abduction. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his most up-to-date acting talents alongside many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It is a real pity that this film was not recognized enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so Fanning and the director. And maybe even the highest quality visual effects. <br /> <br /> If you like excellent thrillers, slightly unbalanced and suspenseful, this is the one to see. The most surprising thing is that the elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
