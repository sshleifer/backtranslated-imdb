You can discuss Prince's acting talent or even his choice to parody his life in this film. There is no debate on his musical talent either then or now. It seems to have been a shadow twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Having lived the exaggeration of this film (high school graduated in 85), I can say that there was nothing bigger at the moment. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) who tried to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun through the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every "Air Band" at the time impersonating Prince, was the most exciting thing absolute. For a couple of weeks, Prince was older than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the film and we were really excited when it was previewed. He did not disappoint. ALL were captured. At the time I was an MTV addict (actually they played music then ... always) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I have to qualify this comment by saying that, at that time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk / New Wave genre "The Prince's music at the time transcended all types and styles. One of the reasons that some seem so unbalanced and contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big back then. All the things that remind you of the 80s were iconic back then. It was mainstream and looks like a clich√© now. It's like Rappin's grandmother commercial for Wendy's burgers. <br /> <br /> It sounds silly now because EVERYONE was involved in it (unfortunately, a bit like a bizarre purple macarena or something.) Anyway I hope this gave you some insight.
