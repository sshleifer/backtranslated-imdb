IN COLD BLOOD must be classified as a first-rate film, even if the subject is as sad as it is in the world of fiction, but fans of film noir should definitely find this a compelling work, based on a real criminal madness . <br /> <br /> It opens with the music of Quincy Jones under the headlines and the dramatic visions of a bus heading towards Kansas City, effectively creating the atmosphere of the film even before the credits end . Conrad Hall's black and white photography does an excellent job right from the start. <br /> <br /> Even clear from the beginning: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are natural actors. They do a great job of portraying free spirits looking for the next thrill. "Have you ever seen a million-dollar fry in electric hair?" No, no. There are two types of rules in this world: one for the rich and one for the poor, "says Wilson, taking a gulp of alcohol at the wheel.> <br /> Both are destined to cross the path of a peasant family, mercilessly and without leaving witnesses. <br /> <br /> Blake, who remembers the movies and thinks of looking for gold in Mexico, says: "Remember Bogart in the 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'?" (An ironic moment, because Blake himself was in the film like a kid who was selling lottery tickets. "" I put you for a natural born murderer, "says Wilson to Blake. <br /> <br /> JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the leading detectives of the case, discovering that all four family members were bonded, hit in the head and one had his throat cut. "People around here do not close the doors?" asks PAUL STEWART. "They will do it tonight," is the concise answer. br /> <br /> After the murders, the killers discover that there was "no big fat safe in the wall", as they informed their prison informant. So in the end, it was really a stupid and senseless crime. The question is: why did they do it? And this is something that the second half of the film explores in depth. It takes an hour and a half in the movie before the detectives reach the killers and start the interrogation. <br /> <br /> These are the final scenes that bring the greatest conviction and the greatest interest while the boys are told that I made numerous mistakes and left a living testimony. Real events up to and including the murder are saved to the end. "It doesn't make sense," says Blake to Forsythe. "Mr. Cutter was a very nice gentleman, I thought of it until the moment I cut his throat." The script by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point - and so is his directing. <br /> <br /> To sum up: Brilliant representation of two young men aiming at a criminal madness that made no sense then or now for only $ 43.
