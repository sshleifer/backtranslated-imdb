This is a fantasy film for children based on the Boggy Creek Legend although I don't know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and its kiddie fantasy. Dawn Wells is the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it is very silly and the plot is trivial, but this type of film is perfect for the 8-12 group to which it is addressed. The G-rated children's rate is harmless and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your children alone while watching them. Strictly for set 8-12 y / o, the older boys will get bored and consider him lame.
