This is a strange film, cerebral, surreal, esoteric. If there is such a thing as "intellectual horror" cinema, this is the film. I started to freak out and I wish there was someone else watching him with me, and he barely has a plot! I will have to review this movie several times before actually feeling myself. If you're the kind of person who likes "My dinner with Andre" and Godard's movies, or if you do a lot of mind-altering drugs, you'll probably like this movie. Wow.
