I come from Romania I will try to speak in English. All I want to say about this film is that it is and will be my number one of all time. Seen at least 30 times and we will see it for many years. It has all the little things I like in a movie, it's very moving, it makes me cry. Show a lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality, and the real things that matter to different people. It so happens that for me this is the most important, love, the soul of a man, his inner being, and I see this in this film. Maybe for me it's much more than a movie, it's a test in my mind that could really exist and you do the best from every moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to science fiction, but ... and if. What would happen if all capitalism disappeared and the economy fell? We would all be worried about other issues and my thought is that, on your deathbed, the greatest thing you remember is not wealth, not adventure, not the countries you have visited and the people you remember. But true friends and your true love and hope that after your death, everything will be damn perfect and people would be good and take better care of themselves. WATCH THIS MOVIE and it will probably guide you in your life as it did to me :) Ave from Romania
