A young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her intriguing and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and her uncle (Barry Jones) who is losing her mind and in very delicate conditions that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation, since try to keep it as far as possible from external human contact. The only other person he sees is the real estate custodian, a lascivious character played by Maxwell Reed, who captured the rebel eye of his middle-aged aunt. All this, the aunt and the caretaker, the expert butterfly uncle who has a serious lower part for him, and the sensitive niece in the middle, would have created a darker and more sinister film. As it stands, a plot for a murder sends Trevor Howard (a secret service of the sacked government who took a job at the estate to catalog butterflies) and Simmons who crosses the countryside escaping the police, recalling the titles of "Network of police closing "on her front page photos, hopping on the buses, and liquidating in Liverpool, where they meet some wonderfully expressed characters, and finally confront the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.
