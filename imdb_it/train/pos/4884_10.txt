For people of a certain age, W.W. II was the decisive moment in their lives and anything that followed could never be compared. When the film opens, a recently widowed but still lively woman (Judi Dench) hears a street musician who tries to play the classic song, "Stardust". <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of his memories of playing in a group of almost only girls who enjoyed the bombing during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) happily avoided the project and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> The character of Patrick and Dench meet and decide to reunite the band, which takes them on a series of mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band reunites and reappears successfully. <br /> <br /> The film is exquisitely written and undervalued, with excellent performances by all involved. The characters are well developed and all the people who have not stopped living, despite their years. And there's all that glorious old swing music! <br /> <br /> This is not the pontification of Steven Spielberg, but a serious film. The war has hit everyone and that lesson has not been forgotten in a film that is not afraid to entertain while teaching.
