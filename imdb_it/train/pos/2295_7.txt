There is a very intelligent humor in this film, which is both a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while it seems like an exercise in style (despite big gags like Balasko that continues the part of Dussolier, and an excellent acting of all those involved) and I wondered why Blier made this film. Everything reveals itself at the end, when Blier, who directs Claude Brasseur, receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from the sky, and has the opportunity to say how much he misses. An effective emotional and obviously felt capper. But there's really not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout the execution time. Some really nice scenes and sequences, however, and anyone who loves these 'mosntres sacr√©s' of French cinema should get a lot of fun out of this movie.
