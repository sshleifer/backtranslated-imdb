This is my film ALL the time FAVORITE. It was my Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I saw this movie for the first time with my aunt Brend and her sister Chasity. I was in seventh grade. I fell in love with LOVE with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I read many comments about why Bud left Sissy and how Sissy must "learn to act" married. But let's go back and watch this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the film now, not when I was eight years old is this for Bud & Sissy's relationship that takes a bad turn because he makes fun of him to Gilley Toro. They enter a great battle. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinks that two wrongs will be right and Wes asks her if "she needs help". They are all on the dance floor behaving like idiots when Bud asks Pam, "When are you going to take me home and rape me?" Pam replies: "Whenever you're ready, Cowboy". Bud then returns home with Pam to his downtown Houston apartment. What dad bought for her with his oil money and "all that that implies". Bud is the one who betrays Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he comes home the next day. Sissy is the ONE who leaves Bud. So, it's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he's a real "cowboy" and win her back. <br /> <br /> However, this is my interpretation. I'm sure everyone has theirs! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I got a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
