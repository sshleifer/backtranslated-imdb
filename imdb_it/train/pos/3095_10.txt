So what is the reason? Is there some sort of revenge against this AWESOME show or someone involved in it? Why would the best show I've seen over the years be canceled? I am addicted. I saw this show by chance last fall, and I immediately loved it and saw it every week. Then he left, and I tried Tivo, but he wasn't on the air. So I forgot for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the trash on TV today, it was nice to see something as complete and developed as this. I look at Boston Legal for my eccentric-comic correction, and House for my correction for the mystery-mystery-jackass. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for her "realism", and I love / hate the show, but it couldn't be further from the truth for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, it does. But for once, there is a drama that is REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are some extremes like an ex-gangster who got good at it, a girl who runs away from the crowd, etc., but these people (especially in New York) are really out there, and I mean all of them. I can't get enough. I just hope the ABC pulls its head out of their butts and continues this show. Get respect for having a QUALITY drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If anyone will let him do it.
