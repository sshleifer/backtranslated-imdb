Legend of Zu is perhaps the most exciting film seen in recent years. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unparalleled visual scenarios and stories of divine proportions, Legend of Zu proceeds to blow its spectators with its majesty. This film is wonderfully crafted through the use of high tech CGIs that allow fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. Acting is perfect for this type of film; If you were an immortal with supernatural powers, I would think you would care more for yourself. <br /> <br /> Unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a fast pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who can't keep track of the different characters simply doesn't have to pay attention since he's used to such sophisticated levels as the Titanic. The plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you breathless. Legend of Zu is on a level of magnitude so high that perhaps many people are discouraged by its size. Allow yourself to be completely swallowed up by his fantastic vision and grow to love this movie.
