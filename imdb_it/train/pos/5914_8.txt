MPAA: R nominal for violence, language, nudity and short use of drugs. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After seeing Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more Bashki movies. I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw this. When it was released, the film was very controversial. He was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned, he even brought protests outside the theater where the film was The film was released only on VHS under the title "Street Fight". It is now considered a cult-cult film and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group The Wu-Tang Clan. he said he liked this movie. Personally, I thought that Fritz The Cat was a much better film, but this is also a lot of fun. Watch for fans of Bashki or Blaxploitation. The film mixes live action and animation like the film Who Framed Roger Coniglio. I would have preferred it in full animation but wh atever.The film starts with a reverend and another man runs to save two of their friends from prison. While the prisoners wait, the oldest tells a story of three men he knew. The film then goes into the animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man. They decide to make a name for themselves in Harlem. The chief, a black rabbit, kills a great player in Harlem and in practice becomes a great blow. The film moves like the Italian mafia. He wants it out. The mafia involves the godfather, his three homosexual children and an Italian clown. Lion skin is a fun animated film that is worth checking out if you can find it.
