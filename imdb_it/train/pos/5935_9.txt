After seeing the terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END I knew I had to see it as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Pressing play to view the trailer I thought I was doing another horrible short from what seemed so far away another bad filmmaker trying to bring a new depth to an existing character. But he was instead greeted with a VERY put together trailer for a film that unfortunately does not exist, since I would like to see a finished film even if it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> WORLD'S FINEST composes for BATMAN: DEAD END and then some. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next short film!
