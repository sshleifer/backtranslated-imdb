I had my doubts about another love story in which disabled people find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's not yet at the top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh are exemplary, almost astounding, and they save this from a simple tear-up. Carter's depiction of a victim of the ALS is strong, perhaps even exaggerated at times (sometimes his dialogue dissolves into indistinguishable grumbles). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh could be the perfect compliment to his performance. <br /> <br />
