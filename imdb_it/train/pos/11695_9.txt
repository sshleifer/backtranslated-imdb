This is a fantastic movie! The low grade doesn't matter here. I have no idea where he came from, they have to discuss a different film then. Because I loved it and found it a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> His story was so original and fascinating ... I really can't think of anything negative to say about it. Maybe it must be '' your kind of thing '', but, I've seen this with my sister and my mother, and we've all been taken by it. <br /> <br /> Even the acting was very good, and it's hard to do in a movie like this. But I found all the characters very intriguing and funny. <br /> <br /> I've always been very fond of Dougray Scott and I found his new "dark" role very interesting. It's really terrible hard to make me like a bad guy, but this time I had absolutely no problems. Even more, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this movie, no doubt! Anyone who wants to see a movie with 80% bloodshed should rent something else, though ... But I guess the title gives it enough. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> Give this movie 4 stars out of 5 !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> Have fun!
