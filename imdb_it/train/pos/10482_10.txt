I love this movie. It is one of those that I can look at again and again. It is played well by a good cast who doesn't try too hard to be a star champion. <br /> <br /> The premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pots to make ends meet could have been turned into an Americanized Asshole of a movie or action thriller. Or he would have killed the movie completely. <br /> <br /> The film presents itself as an Ealing comedy with an exceptional wellness factor. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking only for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (no it is not a spoiler!)
