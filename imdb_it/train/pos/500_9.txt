I, like many tough Trekkers (or Trekkies, I don't care!) I suffered during the seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", dreaming of a better show when it was over, lamenting the end of "Deep Space Nine" in 1999. answer. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, fantastic new visual effects, a pop song for the introduction. (I was shocked!) I can't think of something I don't like. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", nobody misses you! Keep on Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
