This is my kind of movie. I am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this film is just that. But it is also a dark comedy. While I see it primarily as a horror / thriller, there will be others who might view it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But in both cases, it's a fascinating descent into madness. The ending caught me off guard, but what an end! Give the viewer a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a fantastic script full of terror and flashes of humor, and a disturbing atmosphere make this film worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think I will need to watch it several times to collect and understand all the subtleties that are in it. But it is a film of the kind that will be a pleasure and not a task to be done.
