I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of the famous black entertainers ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (despite) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls are outside the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... the stereotypes are there, but it was so ... and these cartoons were intended as entertainment for adults in the local cinema before the main function. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising's cartoons tended to be more "cutesy" and more sophisticated (after all ... we're talking about MGM) than the standard animated short made to Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or low Colombia. Even the very first Disney Mickey Mouse had a lot of backyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned it shortly before going on "Technicolor". <br /> <br /> Disney also had cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers ... for example, the 1937 Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. In 50 years from now ... clips from the Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be scrutinized, analyzed ... and even scorned by future viewers.
