I must stress, before reading this review, that in no way is this a declaration against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something in it, which I hope you understand, I am against politicians in general ... but if you are looking for to be offended ... I can't help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran as this film is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this film). Which is a shame, because the film is fantastic. It would not be for "Grbavica", this film would have won at the Berlin International Film Festival. Rightly so (it was the second place, or the second place if you want it). Why? Because it's a film about oppression. It is not even that this is a complete women's issue. It's about the government trying to keep people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But forbidding them nothing is solved and / or they can make this film disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a great summary: "Comedy about a tragedy", which sums it up very well!
