I am proud to say that I own a full copy of Crown Drive's comedy drive-in cheese from the 1970s on DVD. It's a really silly and pleasantly irrelevant film with a pleasantly lively atmosphere for 70 years. Try to make a sincere point that true love and friendship are more important in the life of a nice set of wheels and a quick piece of tail. Sure, it's essentially a brazen adolescent masculine fantasy photo - the main goofus teen character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, the respect of his friends, and the chance to show off a local van racing bully - but he's too doped and good-natured to hate. Stuart Getz as our clumsy protagonist creates a captivating ironic protagonist, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's affection is a well-defined cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is also quite succulent as a beautiful blonde, and mocking Neanderthal Stephan Oliver a 60s perennial movie biker) is wonderfully hateful as the brutal Dugan Hicks. A precursor of Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute uprising like Andy, the owner of the owner of Getz's car wash, a pedantic and amazon lover who wears very ugly Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a serious gambling habit. I especially like the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny - one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works on Danny's torso! And the insidiously catchy and luck-hit thematic song by Sammy Johns bounces around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a great groovy retro-70 fun!
