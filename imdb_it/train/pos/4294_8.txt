There was no dry eye in the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema, after seeing this gem of a movie in a sold out house as part of this year's Hamburg Festival. And the tears shed were all laughter. This movie was fun, there's no other way to say it. There was not a boring piece in it, I laughed all this and with me all the others of us three hundred lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was absolutely fantastic. A big clown if necessary and serious if the situation requires it. Obviously the performance was completely over the top, but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. Equally exceptional was Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I love to see a lot, and her mother was also a very strong performance. The sisters could have been a little more detailed in the characters, but other than that there is nothing to complain about. I spent a nice afternoon seeing this film while Hamburg was drowning in the rain outside and I hope that films like this from France will be published regularly in Germany. But the distributors in this country do not seem to understand that the French make good films. At least I can't wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because I need to watch that movie at other times!
