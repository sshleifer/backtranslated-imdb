I'm so upset that the ABC giving up another show that has a chance to be a real winner. This show is so beautiful, the script and the plot were great, a real original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors, but these are a group of very talented actors. The concept and the idea are really a new and interesting idea for a TV show, many of us share the whole idea of ​​"connections". I love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there isn't a person connected to this show that I didn't like, even those that were only for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and the characters are so easy to love and so talented !! I wish the ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show halfway, Furthermore it wasn't advertised enough. Really unfair !! to all !!. This show has shown great promise. I will first let ABC know how I feel and continue to send emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send email to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!! ONLINE PETITION FOR SAVING SIX DEGREES: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html WE CAN DO IT !! SIGN THIS PETITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE !!!
