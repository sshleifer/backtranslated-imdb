After the initial shock of realizing Mr Branagh's courage to film this film, I literally shook myself with the excitement of having this epic right in front of me. I was not disappointed. So true for Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It upset me. I always love to see, or rather listen to Branagh and this made me wonder ... is this film nicknamed in other countries? It would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
