Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I read both of his books and I think it's great. Peter Faulk is able to offer a decisive line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magical. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a family that is really getting to know each other. Through a journey, father and son connect for the first time in their lives amid a family crisis. They do all the things that fathers and children have to do in life ... they're only doing them much later in life. The situations are very funny, but they have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life (not in an absurd way from the beginning or comics). This is the first time I look at Paul Reiser and I fully believed every emotion that was portrayed. Sometimes his eyes seem so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret film and great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion but an edifying message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job too :)
