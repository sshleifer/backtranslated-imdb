This film is an entertaining and utterly sarcastic vision of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by the photography which consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> A warning, do not take the message of the film seriously. It is not for mass consumption (and this is not a compliment). The message is somewhat post-college styled, a neophyte view of society. <br /> <br /> I liked the baseline of a fictional zine editor who verbally whipped the mobocracy of the 90s.
