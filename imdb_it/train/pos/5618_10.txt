This is a disturbing film. Creepier of every other David Lynch, and this shows that a great director is Polanski since this is not his usual kind of work, and it is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> It all starts with Trelkovski moving to a palace in Paris. He soon discovers that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and believes that the rest of the people living there pushed her to do so. He also believes that they are trying to do the same with him. What results is an incredible and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The entire production has a classic horror written everywhere: from the imaginary to the music the viewer can feel the poor terror of Trelkovski. <br /> <br /> Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe it drives him crazy? There's a difference? Find out for yourself. 10/10
