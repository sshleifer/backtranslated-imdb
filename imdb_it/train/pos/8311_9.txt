I really enjoyed this movie, it was great and the actors were fantastic! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, is very good at his job, when you see him in a musical movie, you know he will be nice! I would suggest that people watch this hot, sad and special movie if they want to learn more about Richard! Awesome! Fresh!
