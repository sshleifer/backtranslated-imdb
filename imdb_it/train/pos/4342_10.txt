This film didn't really surprise me, as such, it just became better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well ... we'll see how he does it ..." Then I saw that Peter Falk was there. I appreciate Colombo. Although I've never been a big fan of the show, I've always enjoyed watching Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They enjoyed each other so well that I practically felt dizzy with fun! ... And I didn't even drink! <br /> <br /> This film was so well made that I wanted to talk on the phone with Paul and let him know how much I liked it! but I couldn't find his number. It must be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> This was one of those films about which I had no idea what it would handle or who it was or nothing about. He just came in and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see, if I don't like it, I don't have to watch it ..." ... and I ended up loving it!
