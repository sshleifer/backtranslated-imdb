Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I hadn't seen this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that surely contains that storybook, the songs entertain and the secondary character is all please. The bad guys in the form of half-sisters are perfectly evil and cowards. Then there is the most magical of all Disney, the mice that make the dress and you know the rest. To summarize, the four Disney Princess films are all fantastic, but this is a fascinating magical experience, watch and have fun. Oh and, of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their appeal. With Elene Wood and the others the film has such a feeling, you simply can't help but smile. <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course in the real world some believers are the other hoper. In this film it is even more magical when his rainbow arrives smiling. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest is ... Cinderella
