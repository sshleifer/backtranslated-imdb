Viggo Mortensen is the new inmate of a haunted prison where the guardian (played well by Lane Smith) has a horrible secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and prisoners are massacred by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the ergastolano who knows the secret and is afraid of his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of action movies with Stallone or Van Damme or high-caliber dramas like Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However I did not expect a ghost story more along the lines of Exorcist III. The prison is still an atmospheric effort and certainly remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The film is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (currently) unknown. Lane Smith turns out to be the best because his guardian is not the usual clich√© of personified evil but rather nervous and nervous that adds a certain credibility to a film that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4- (Good)
