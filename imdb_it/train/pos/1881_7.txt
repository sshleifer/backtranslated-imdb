As a drunk prankster, Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, Moore's role was so perfect that he also trapped him as an actor. Many disappointments are soon followed (including the pale sequel of this film), but this does not diminish the charm or charm of this image, which is expertly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are shaky, but the cast performs with so much enthusiasm that it's a difficult film to resist. He has a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Gielgud a sly and ironically funny role like Arthur's valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as a love interest of the blue collar) is brazen in a low tone and Moore is brash, but skilled and lively; he never shook off Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document of a highlight of the career to love. *** from ****
