The part of The Grinch was created for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with his performance. Not being a great admirer I was worried but pleasantly surprised by the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou, who was the prettiest girl I've seen on the screen in a long time and showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I was even attracted to tears at some point! I never read Dr. Seuss's book of the story, so I didn't know what to expect, the humor was rather dark. Overall, I liked the movie (apart from the songs!) And I'd recommend it, especially for the family's vision.
