This is a very moving photo of 3 forty six best friends in a small English town. There is a passionate love and a new beginning with a young piano instructor, when the tragedy strikes and the heart changes forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful job. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! NOTICE SPOILER !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is played by his beautiful young piano instructor and a passionate romantic bloom. His two jealous "friends" play an immature joke that quickly leads to the tragedy. He loses his love and his friends in one fell swoop. In the end an unexpected surprise puts them back together (in my opinion his forgiveness is not justified)
