A prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series by the creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, as well as the new co-creator of the series Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is set in the twelve colonies about 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series, in addition to its human drama, also tells the key steps in the development of what would become the Cylon race. <br /> <br /> The pilot and the series are destined to follow two families; Graystone's which includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while the Adama includes Giuseppe (Esai Morales) a lawyer and his son William the future admiral of Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some great experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker and some relatively new talented actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For Battlestar Gallactica fans there are similarities and continuity with that series, but it's also very different. In the pilot at least the elements of science fiction are certainly present but they are the smallest part of this series. The Caprica scenes while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have a retro touch, this is achieved through some of the architecture, costumes and the way it is filmed. <br /> <br /> While the graphic aspect of the two series has some substantial differences, some of the themes seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme rarely touched on in BG is much more important. . We also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether a machine may or may not have one, as well as issues relating to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The pilot was released directly to DVD in a non-classified version prior to broadcast on TV, the series is ready to begin in 2010. <br /> <br /> How Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver
