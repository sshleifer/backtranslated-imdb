Ok, so it's not a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it doesn't have to be. The only purpose of this film is to make the viewer laugh several times. If he can make the viewer laugh a lot, he has achieved his goal. I laughed out loud and came out with a smile. I feel like I have the value of my money.
