A director of the first hour (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to watch the world of a middle-aged, bourgeois, depressed man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman in the role of William H. Macy's 6-year-old son is the coolest little actor I've seen in a while. Macy is brilliant in a part that seems almost written for him as a self-tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always nice to see Donald Sutherland and here he is as wonderful as Macy's insensitive father. The films alternate with the audio track and it is worth listening to the director who explains how he chose the cast, the locations and he filmed the film. The basic sound of the 2-channel dolby is adequate for this film and well recorded. Cinematography creates the atmosphere with a very subtle musical background. Any movie fan or observer of human nature will appreciate this especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
