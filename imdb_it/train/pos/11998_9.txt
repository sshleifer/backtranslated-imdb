This film was beautiful. It was full of memorable images, good acting and touching subjects. It would be very easy to write it as too sentimental, but this is the feeling that this type of film is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the development and presentation of the story. There were some cheese shots, but that's to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can make is that there were not many details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures, etc. Of Joseph Smith; was designed to take a quick look at some of the highlights of one of the most extraordinary American and historical religious figures of all time.
