I saw this movie in theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I really enjoyed it, and recently became the owner of a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year olds love this movie and have repeatedly asked to watch it. <br /> <br /> I too enjoyed watching it again. Although I have to admit that it's not so nice on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I have no older children so I don't know what they would think. <br /> <br /> The songs are very nice. My daughter continues to sing them again and again. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
