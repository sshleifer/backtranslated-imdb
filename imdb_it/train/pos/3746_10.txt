I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title when the soldier pin "CUCCHIEI!" I struggle every time. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and to people who love other Jason Steele movies. His animation style is very original. It takes some views to see the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also fun, and it's definitely not something you would have heard before. Like Max the deformed Spatula that has a sound and light system in its head that radiates colored lights and cheerful music every time it talks about its miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch when and where.
