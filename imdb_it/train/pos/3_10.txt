"The whole world is a stage and its people are actors" - or something like that. Who the hell said that the theater stopped at the orchestra pit or even at the theater door? Why doesn't the public participate in the theatrical experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This film was a great experiment that said: "Hey, the story is you and needs more than your attention, it needs your active participation". "Sometimes we bring you the story, sometimes you have to go to history." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately no one has heard, but this does not mean that it should not have been said.
