A River Runs Through It is one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated. The acting is wonderful and sober, with every gesture, smile and nod that bear meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as a preacher father. The film moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through ebb and flow, but in the end it's worth it.
