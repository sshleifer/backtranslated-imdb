I enjoyed watching this film on TCM and watching a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) playing the detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". In 1930 William Powell played in the Philo Vance series and in this photo, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case in which a man named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) he was found dead and Archer was in a room that was locked from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother of Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in some of these Philo Vance films and also gave a great interpretation in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely actor could very well be the murderer. Enjoy a great classic of the past.
