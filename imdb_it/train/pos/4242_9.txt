I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The film is a diamond among the coals during this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaws. This film should have made them protagonists. Shame in the studio for not putting all they had behind this movie. It could have easily been a franchise. DVD output is a must and a worthy remake would revive this movie. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It will leave you speechless. Times have changed radically since those days, or at least we like to think we have them.
