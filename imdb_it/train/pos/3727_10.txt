Tigerland is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and in my opinion it even surpasses the full metal jacket, a film of a similar nature. Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell and is a character that remains in your mind long after the film ends. The finish is brilliantly cut from schumacher - with the melodic harmony that sings and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave. What film.
