I loved this film because in my mind it seemed to capture perfectly what I imagined that life in French colonial Africa was like in the 1950s ("my" generation anyway). But I was really enraptured by his quiet rhythm and glorious ending. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, you have to concentrate intensely on what is happening. I've never been more impressed by the "wrap-up" of a movie. I remember screaming "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch !!
