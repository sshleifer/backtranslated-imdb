Probably my favorite movie of all time, a story of altruism, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not a sermon or boring. It never gets old, despite having seen it about 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas's performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few really nice roles, is a delight. The children, as the grandmother says, look more like the "bourgeois clothes" of children, but this makes them more fun to watch. And the slow awakening of the mother to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen inches, they would all be "standing" for this movie.
