The master of cinema Alain Resnais loves working with those actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see members of the Resnais family such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant dealing with serious issues such as death, religion, suicide, love and their general implications on our daily life . The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is evident as well as friends, addressing each other using a formal tea. In 1984, while making L'amour à mort, Resnais dealt with time, memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence: is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago, in 1968, that Resnais made a somewhat similar film, Je t'aime Je t'aime, which also speaks of love and memories. The message of this film is strong and clear: true and profound love can even embarrass science as dead lovers resume their lost lives leaving the doctors to take care of their reputation. Amour à mort is like a game which is not educational at all. It is a film in which the soundtrack is perfectly in tandem with its images. This is one of the reasons why this film can be easily understood.
