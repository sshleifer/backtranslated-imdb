This film was quite a surprise. I didn't expect much, to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? So? Probably something crude and with the usual exaggerated contractions in the arm and facial contortions that low-level silent films show so often. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo must have simply shocked the people in the studio as well as me, because this movie made them a star, and deservedly. Instinctively he sensed the power to stop, or simply to hold a meaningful expression for a long moment, so that its effect could be perceived and not just seen. I kept thinking to myself, how did this modern actress get into a squeaky and silent movie? He was only years and years ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it is the usual story of rediscovered and lost love. It is only the performance of Garbo as Leonora, the poor girl from the village who makes herself beautiful in the big city and then returns to take the man who has gone away, who gives him life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is useful, but his character is never really developed and is completely diminished by the script. At some point it is made to wear Garbo's clothes, let himself go for a sip, then return ignominiously and return them. And let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo and then his wife. Too ordinary, he hasn't had much career after this and I can understand why. But it is sufficient as the somewhat mystifying object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely fantastic line in this film that says it all. "Leonora, you're becoming obvious." Yes, really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it is without seeing the whole movie, just look at the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo's gaze as he sits alone in his luxurious car says anything. "He must be so happy, he has everything he wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all about this. I have to see it again, Garbo is just great.
