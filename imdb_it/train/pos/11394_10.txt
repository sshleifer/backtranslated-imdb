While the story is sweet, and the dance and song in the main part of the film are a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the sequence of dreams. It presents the combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the fascinating beauty of French Impressionist art, the engaging choreography of Kelly (including his ecstatic "pas de deux d'amour", actually a separate genre) , with the most magnificent palette of colors ever devised for the set. Coupling increasing music and visual explosion with those dances has been a true work of creative genius and great artist.
