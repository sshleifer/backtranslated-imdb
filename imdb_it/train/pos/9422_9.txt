When I learned of the death of Sir Alec Guinness, this was the first of his many films that I thought I'd review. What a wonderful commentary from the film, even after all these years. And Guinness helps weave the charm in every frame. His eyes and face are as bright as the white dress he wears. Both he and the film must be considered favorites of life.
