I have a rap at zero interest and in ghetto culture, I'm white and like classic rock, however, that didn't stop me from enjoying this fantastic comedy. It's practically a sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same film, only on rap instead or rock. Yet it's fun. There are many funny jokes but not without some jokes that simply fall flat. The characters are all very funny and believable. I only watched because it made me laugh at three in the morning, and any movie that could do that deserves at least a test screening. One of the reasons this movie was so funny is that it mocks rap from another. Rap today worries about the wrong things and goes on with the studio noise and little talent. This film was born from an era when rappers deserved more credit. Overall, it's a fun film with many lines about racism, sex and musical culture among the most obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for all This is Spinal Tap fans. They are essentially the same film, only on different worlds, and yes, the same lines work in both films.
