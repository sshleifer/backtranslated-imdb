Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Gosha - played by Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) to the best existing chambara films. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) works for Nakadei, who wants to become the daymio. Okada, being the "cleanest" of Nakadei is treated like a dog - and after a while he realizes - what is really for Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot more to this film - every fan of Japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means punishment of the heavens)
