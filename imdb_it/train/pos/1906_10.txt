Unfortunately, 8 simple rules, to hang out with my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom that John Ritter worked on after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors of all time. He had everything, a comedy (which he can forget in Three's Company) but he was also an excellent dramatic actor (Unforgivable ?? worth watching a movie on TV) So much loved all the other cast members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley Martin) John is THE, it was the reason I was attracted to the show in the first place, and it was his perfect comic delivery that was able to make me break every time. <br /> <br /> I loved the way the show was not all sugary (even though I loved The Cosby Show, come on, they were too nice to each other lol) they brilliantly interpreted the typical family dynamics. It was quite realistic what with all the sibling rivalries and the disputes between the parents, but still made it fun. A lot of American sitcoms try to fill the shows entirely with morality and what not, and this show didn't. Yes, there were some, how to deal with important problems, such as drugs and bullying, but they didn't try to be anything but a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John's death show was brilliantly done, I still sobbing like a baby every time I see it. You could feel how raw emotions were during those incredibly difficult episodes. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the show has been canceled, I still enjoy watching the replicas and I never get tired of doing it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always be remembered for your hilarious portrayal of this overly protective father, who would rather shut his daughters in their room than go out with a boy =) You rock Ritter !!!
