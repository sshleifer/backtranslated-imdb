I liked watching this. I had no idea that it was part of a larger series. I was about 6 years old when he was on TV. I thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination with something that was clear in the president's pile of bath toys. My parents had recorded this off TV when it was originally broadcast on NBC. The tape also had the old Sanka coffee ad along with some others. I'm thinking of coming home early and will try to record the tape on my computer so that anyone who wants a copy can do it. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do it through the IMDb website. Feel free. I will keep you updated and let you know when I have the show in digital format.
