Being a big fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out they had made a movie together and made it my mission to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film has far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for courageous but not quite satisfying performances, but I am happy to say that they both managed to keep me fascinated and believe the story as it went on. Moon Child has the right dose of humor, action, romance and serious, heartbreaking moments. I can't say that I ever cried more in a film and these softer moments are admirably played by the couple, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely amazing and even if there are some moments of uncertainty at the beginning, you are ready to enter the movie and start to connect with the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
