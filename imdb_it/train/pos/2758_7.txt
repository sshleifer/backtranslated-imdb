This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The character development in this film is excellent. We come to believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who yearns to love and take care of "normal" society. The acting is excellent, and the prize for the best actor in Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes of the film underline the fact that Georges is sad about his abandonment by his family, and his desire to be treated like a normal person. The song that is played repeatedly also reinforces this message. The film shows that people with mental handicaps are good-natured. We treated them with discrimination and abandonment, a fact that is highlighted by the scene in which Georges gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen). If we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so attracted by the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. It's a touching film for good-natured souls.
