Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins could shake the Christian subculture world (and make millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND books, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the evangelical association Billy Graham, gave us this masterpiece. What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, we hear about it on the news because the directors can't afford to show it. The premise of the film is rooted in the pre-millennial Eschatalogia, pre-tribulation, in the belief that Christ comes once for the secret capture of the true church, and then returns to the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What terrified me in middle school now makes me laugh. The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey through the tribulation (and two of the three sequels in the film) tell her extraordinary story of incredulity and, ultimately, of damnation. I hate to admit it, but I still enjoy watching it. He also has the same score as Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make this observation.
