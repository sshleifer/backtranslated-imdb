The director Brian Yuzna has had an irregular career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces like "Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", but at the same time he made terrible films like "Faust: Love for the damned" "or the mediocre" Progeny. Obviously he is better at the Producer headquarters, where his work on the production of the Stuart Gordon films was superb. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist", is one of his minor works as a director, but the low profile has benefited the film and its lack of pretense make it a very pleasant experience.It tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (superbly played by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day he discovers that his perfect life is not as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) is having an affair with the pool boy This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a murderous madness as he takes revenge on the world to be so "disgusting so ". <br /> <br /> The premise is very well managed by Yuzna, as he takes us around after Feinstone's day of revenge. What makes this film different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective, we follow Feinstone because it is the main character. We assist as you switch from a respected professional to a psychopath in one day. Yuzna manages to give the film the exact amount of suspense, but adds a good dose of black humor that really helps the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the success of the premise is in Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. It can make you feel sympathy and hatred towards him at the same time, and the subtle humor of his character is another aspect that helps the film. The rest of the cast is not good, and I think their acting below average makes the film suffer more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Foree, as a detective who tries to capture Feinstone. Although his part is rather small, he does a great job with it. <br /> <br /> With a dentist as a killer, bloody scenes are expected and Brian Yuzna offers an excellent SFX in the correct quantity. It's nice to see that you don't overdo it as usual, and I dare say that this is a highlight of the film. He has the exact amount of blood expected, nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna restrained himself from his common excesses and the result is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although this is not among Yuzna's most famous films, I'd say it's one of his best. Of course, it is not classic material like his masterpieces, but it is a film that is fun and never becomes boring or boring. It's a simple film with a low budget, but for what it is, I think it's shaken. 7/10
