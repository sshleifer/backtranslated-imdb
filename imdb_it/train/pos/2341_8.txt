This is really a fun show, made in a gruesome way, very similar to a Tim Burton movie. It's worth a look, because it's much more creative than most shows this season. Best of all, it's not a "reality" show. I wonder why the viewing public is so ready to accept such shows (which lack creativity) and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative twist. <br /> <br /> While some comment on the premise, I think it's really unusual. Much more fun than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the tube from "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the narration and the music are wonderful. If you like shows a little out of the way, I would recommend it. It's not strange how Twin Peaks was, but it looks serious.
