This is a small and sad story of cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who fled to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is an American Japanese laborer with rock and roll stardom aspirations but not very concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken in order to remain permanently in the United States, with the knowledge that although they will live together until they receive a "green card", the wedding will be in name only. It soon develops that the parts are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As an immigration lawyer, I saw these "arrangements" come to life on their own, so I was pleased to see how the director developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
