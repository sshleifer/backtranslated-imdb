Acting: fantastic. The story - incredible. The script is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this film. Yes, it's slow and it mainly speaks, but the whole story of all their lives and how it's told with flashbacks in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. I myself am reading the book on which the film is based and it has shown me even more light in this story and answers some questions that have remained unanswered in the film. I also have to read the Exectioner song, which is the other half of Gilmore's story. This film made me think so much about the phrase "penetrating the other side of the mirror". You hear a song in the movie Gary Gilmore's Eyes, from a punk band that wrote a song about what it would be like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and while you listen , which is after the last time Mikal sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were just the song itself. This film opened my eyes in that way and in many others. I highly recommend this film (and the book).
