The world of dragon hunters is a world challenged by 3D gravity. Planetoids, pieces of buildings and strange flat plants fluctuate in the atmosphere while the terrain towards most of the characters is falling is nowhere to be seen. It is a world that recalls Neverending Story, when the Nothing came to devour the world. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, the villain here is also the Gobbler of the World. This time it's a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. The heroes are a great but taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy companion who runs the business side of the duo and a strange useless animal. To them is added the most talkative girl in the world who, to my regret, did not die horribly painful and, I hope, soon. <br /> <br /> The animation is fantastic. The voices and sounds are top notch. Too bad the story is as simple as one can imagine. They go to stop the World Gobbler, they reach it almost immediately, they defeat it. The end. No real character development or twists. Not even the ones I'd expect from a movie with a story like that. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: it's a nice thing to watch, probably the kids will have fun, but that's all. No depth in this world (pun intended).
