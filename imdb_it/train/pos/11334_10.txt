I would say that this film gives an idea of ​​the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is divided by divorce or another disaster. I highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals who plan to have a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters attractive and very nice from a multitude of dimensions. <br /> <br /> scary monster although probably not scary for most adults, it has a very real clue as to what the overactive imagination of a child facing unknown terror could create. <br /> <br /> I found the movie delicious!
