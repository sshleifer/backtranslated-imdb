Wow. Um ... well ... wow! I guess I'll start with the plot. A married woman (Lucy) arrives at her family's home would be husband (Mathurin) in France, where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will). the young Lucy discovers a legend of a Beast that wandered in the gardens for centuries. In bed that night, he begins to fantasize about the Beast and his consensual joke with the former landlady. Here's where it gets interesting! The plot is really quite thin (and seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the film), but the director rewards (?) Those who attract him with a shocking and exhilarating ending. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great cinema, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a film about bestiality (which almost gives a sympathetic look on the subject) this film is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, don't be afraid of this: apart from some riding action at the beginning, the "actions" are pretty comic, IMO)
