It's a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in its predictability. Change the Kung Fu for football and the Turkish family for a Pakistani, and see Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene by scene. A nice feature that serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of the fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway, which starts with miserable losses and progresses slowly until the last fight is a victory against oneself, like the master Kung Fu stressed several times. On a different level, Danish life is very different from the image it has of strangers: non-indigenous immigrants who make a large proportion (actually, the majority) of Danish citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, the scorn of the immigrant girl in the movie begging. Everyone portrays an image different from the one you have in mind when you hear the word Denmark.
