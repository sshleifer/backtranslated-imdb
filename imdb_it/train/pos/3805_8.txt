After seeing the trailer, I was surprised that this film never went into theaters, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a great time watching it and I have to say that this film is better than some of the main animated films. Of course, it has its flaws but I can still really recommend it. The animation is well done, very funny and unique and the story pushed me to watch it until the end. Some of the backdrops are wonderful and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought that Forest Whitaker's performance felt a bit lifeless, but that's how the Lian-Chu character is depicted in this movie. So, in general, congratulations, I liked it a lot and I hope it's successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great films like this. I would recommend giving him a chance and being surprised at how beautiful a film with such a small budget can be. Hektor alone is worth watching the movie because some of his moments are hilarious like those of Stitch.
