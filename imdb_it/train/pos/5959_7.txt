Although this film will not go down in the annals of great cinema, it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film was finally released on video where it should have debuted in the first place. <br /> <br /> The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners they called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who acts as a surrogate to get a deposit for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a mysterious Cadillac lover who becomes his lover. Fox gives a simple and touching performance and Nunn is as reliable as ever. Micheal des Barres is a hoot as a first-rate lawyer. The ensemble casts - made of familiar faces - work well together to give life to this group of extravagant characters. This is a good rental and one of the few you can see with the whole family.
