Fatal Error is a really interesting movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the film. The film's cast worked very well. Robert Wagner played his role well. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was beautiful. There is perhaps a big age difference there, but they are a unique couple. The two actors really worked together quite well. The film's music is really good from Ron Ramin and fits the film very well. There's a lot going on in the movie that you don't know what's going on and what's going to happen next and this movie makes you go from beginning to end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner, then watch this excellent movie!
