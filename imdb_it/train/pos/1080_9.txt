Nowadays, cinema "comedies" are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, vulgar language, and groin kicks. Modern comedies attract the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow brain. Of course, good comedy will occasionally come, but they are becoming increasingly rare. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings: his dream house" shows what Hollywood of the 1940s was capable of doing, and it's just screaming funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows their story, starting with hunting at home, building the house, to the finished house - with its "softener zuzz-zuzz". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly entertaining while watching the costs of the house losing control). However, the film was stolen by Blandings' wise lawyer, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Succeeding in stealing every scene in which he finds himself, Douglas is subtly hilarious as he watches the stormy Blandings from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny is also the aristocratic architect Blandings and Harry Shannon as the old and rusty old water well. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need an elevator, whether you're building a house or not.
