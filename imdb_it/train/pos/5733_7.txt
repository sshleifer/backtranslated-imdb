I'll do a little scales here and say that I liked it. However, the sticker will only attract those with very absurd tendencies. It is certainly something that most people will not get, as well as the nature of the absurd. <br /> <br /> the animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul in the mouth, violent and stupid. no redeeming qualities. his wife screams and complains, apparently barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point. <br /> <br /> but still, that's the point;) <br /> <br /> If you are not sequiters, vulgar language and complete and total randomness are your thing, you will like it very much. <br /> <br /> It's really short, so I'd probably rent it instead of buying.
