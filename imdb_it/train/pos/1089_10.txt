This film was made in 1948, but it still sounds true today. Very, very funny. Start with a family that wants to buy a small place in the country and "build" from there. Anyone who has ever built a home will find this film very appealing. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delicious in this film. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 40s ... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made for the cost of things, and those comparisons with today's costs are quite surprising. I can't imagine anyone not having completely enjoyed this movie. I'm surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.
