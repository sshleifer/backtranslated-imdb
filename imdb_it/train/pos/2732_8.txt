Herbet Clutter, his wife Bonnie and their teenage sons Kenyon and Nancy were highly appreciated and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the writer Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case until its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well-written, it has become an international best seller and remains a touchstone for offenders to date. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book yes. Shot in black and white in many of the places of real life, it has a slightly documentary, icy and detached quality - and the general cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly. As a murderer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a deep disgust and the shock of unexpected understanding; it is a masterful performance from beginning to end. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less handsome. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and take them to the Clutter home - only to suddenly flash in front of the crime to detail the investigation that eventually led to to their arrest and conviction. The focus of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened at Clutter's house; actually shot in the same house as Clutter, it's a spinechilling sequence, horrible and deeply disturbing. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks leads the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, wandering only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preacher. Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial nuisance. Strong and recommended stuff. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
