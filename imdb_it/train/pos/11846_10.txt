I really enjoyed this movie. The entertainment was well done and the romance was nice. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and Hans Zimmer's score was excellent. What many people do not understand is how well they relate to the Heart of Dark / Apocalypse Now themes (what happens when the so-called "civilization" invades someone at home, what it means to be "civilized" etc.). The scenery and the opening music were very moving. The film is a lament for an America that was once beautiful.
