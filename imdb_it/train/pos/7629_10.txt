Kurt Russell It's Elvis, simple and simple. His dedication to this role has led to what I think is the best film ever. If you are an Elvis fan, watch it if you can. <br /> <br /> The television film was made two years after Elvis died. <br /> <br /> A tip, there are two versions: one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes. The only one to look at is the longer one. The shorter one has more than an hour of deleted movies. It just doesn't work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that have been cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis's childhood through his appearance as the biggest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real dad) are as good as Elvis's parents. And Pat Hingle offers a very competent Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
