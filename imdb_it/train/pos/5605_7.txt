This strangeness of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his concerns were at the time he did it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Parisian apartment where the former tenant committed suicide. Become obsessed with the discovery of what led her to do it, to the point that she is dressing in a dragging way and recalling events in the way they could have unfolded. The film is shocking to a certain extent, and it has that atmosphere of gruesome terror to which Polanski excels, but it comes out too much as a remake of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion", two other Polanski films that deal with scary things in moody apartments. <br /> <br /> But as far as concern is concerned ... unless I'm reading too much in the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution that he tried to be labeled as a pervert sexual and exiled from America. Do not judge him in one way or another, but it is difficult to deny proof of this in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
