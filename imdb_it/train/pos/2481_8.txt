I admit I only saw three of Shakespeare's works (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and, of course, Hamlet), one that I liked, the other that I found so well (Macbeth) and Hamlet, I just found a masterpiece. I am pleased to tell you that this adaptation is just as good as the intense and dramatic play. The acting is extremely strong (with a cast whose protagonists are Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal how can it be lost?) And the change over the period of time (it seems between 17 and 1800) takes place magnificently while the characters move and say their infamous lines directly from the script itself that every fan of the Shakespearean drama will get creeps. If you find yourself in this popular drama, I strongly urge you to see this powerful 1996 adaptation by Shakespearean admirer Kenneth Branagh.
