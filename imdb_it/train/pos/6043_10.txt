I saw the freebird movie and I think it's great! it's fun to relax, over time the British film industry has had something fun !! it's nice how the guy who met them at the service station was mentioned in the film in the press agents, nice touch. The acting was convincing (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some good moments I had in the bike scene. It was good to see the director get into acting, well done jon! Eventually a new crop is mentioned, in Ireland is this the basis for a second film? I hope to make them arrive. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
