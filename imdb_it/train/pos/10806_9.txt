I heard this movie - for everything. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, a typical Australian blend of a soft, slightly self-deprecating and very persistent approach. I really liked cinema and directing. Pace was right and the representations of almost all the characters were impressive. Gosh, Russell's talent in 1993 didn't shine! .. and I have yet to see Gladiator.
