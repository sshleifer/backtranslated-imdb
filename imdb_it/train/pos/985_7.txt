This film resembles in many ways "enemy of the state" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, since an innocent (black) man is pursued by the "government" with all the modern technology that man knows. Usually when the plot is copied in this way the result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Obviously I love everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not honest, but there were other positive things about this film. The main character, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story was accompanied by excellent extras such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was however irritating to most of the part. It is so out of place, it makes bad jokes, it evokes sympathy from the public. Or not to begin with, the strange thing is that he grows on you (and also on his followers!). I didn't expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised by a good action movie with comic pieces. 7/10
