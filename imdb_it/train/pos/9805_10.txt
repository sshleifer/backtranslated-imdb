Fans of 'Capital City' rejoice! This first season of this series is now available on network DVD and I recently received my copy! Although it is a very important set of key characters in the "nonconformist" business plan, "CAPITAL CITY" offers us different moments through its first and second season, when each team member plays a significant role in a particular central or peripheral plot. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of the Head Trader staff Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) is balanced with its own mannerisms, interests and distinctive personalities that help make the unfamiliar and, at the most people, apparently sterile financial trading subjects who reasonably engage themselves through the engaging performances of the cast. In reality, this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather goofy senior leadership of Shane Longman represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that an unconventional way of working as a clerk on Wendy's team would not have become a reality if it were not for a youthful and lonely "free spirit" that Peter Longman inherited thirty percent of his company from his father and allowed a way trendier, the modern way of doing business relaxed becomes reality. To a certain extent, immediate supervisor Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) follows the establishment in the traditional way of running the company, but his passion for Wendy sees him instead occupy the "middle ground" on most occasions. The main interest in the series, I believe, comes from the latent romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge's Declan and trusty German blonde-haired traitor Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell) who had continually asked viewers if the situation between these two colleagues it would develop beyond the close friendship / affection that they undoubtedly had. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to browse through this title, and I hope the second season of thirteen will not be too far away!
