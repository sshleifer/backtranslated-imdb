I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a great direction, from the already known Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the film takes place, in Catalonia, to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Luna once again explores the theme of an obsession, in this case the obsession of a young boy for milk women. There are some psychological concepts in this story like the rejection complex that the eldest son feels with the birth of his brother. In the film this is what leads to the obsession of the boy who suddenly sees his mother's milk going to his newborn son. So start looking for a breast that can feed it. He finds it in a recently arrived woman and from here the film is all around this. <br /> <br /> This film lives a lot on images, more than history itself, the viewer captures some moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves an in-depth analysis on almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The surroundings, the landscapes, typical of the region as well as the surreal behavior of the characters, even symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but that intersects it starting from from times to times ... It's worth living in that world, it's worth watching this movie, even if in the end we might be tired and a little tired of the excessive obsession, which is perhaps taken beyond the limits ... < br /> <br /> I also liked the performance of the main character ... 8/10
