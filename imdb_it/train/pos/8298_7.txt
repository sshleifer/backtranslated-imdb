Better than the typical TV movie, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high conceptual update to Faustian's family plot. Urich is likeable as always and Lucci is particularly attractive and devilishly over the top in the mother of all female roles. A kind of hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film soon commits itself to its apocalyptic vision of Miltonesque and the horror fans probably won't have many complaints until the sombre and sloppy speech. 7/10
