This is a musical adaptation of "Oliver Twist" by Dicken. For the most part, the original story has been maintained, although for the flow of the film some secondary plots (such as the summer that he spent to recover and the half-brother) have been omitted. The biggest difference in the film and in the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin is hanged - a very different ending to this musical movie. <br /> <br /> This is a unique musical of its kind one whose style and scope has never been matched before or after. Not only are the songs often quite unique and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. While in most musicals some people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed by dancing, here the numbers often reach hundreds or maybe more. It is truly a sight to behold and I was lucky enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and it is one of my first childhood memories. Having just seen it a few moments ago, I should say that the film has improved over time. Great scenery, wonderful acting and singing - this is a special treatment that is hard to dislike. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was surprised by how tall and feminine Mark Lester's singing was for the film. Well, according to IMDb, his singing was nicknamed by a girl and this would surely have taken his voice into account.
