I was adopted at birth and I definitely didn't have the problems of Antwone fisher in the film, but I still share some of the emotions and this film really helped me to get them out and force me to deal with them. He also made me understand that I have a "missing piece" and now I will look for my relatives. <br /> <br /> I cried for almost a day after seeing it for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his mother, juxtaposed with his father's family reaction to his sudden appearance, is powerful for those of us who don't know what will happen if we find our parents. And his self-confidence and his personal claims to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful. I could really identify with this and my need to tell people "yes, I was pushed aside by my parents when I was born, but another group of parents picked me up and loved me and now I'm a success!" > <br /> He also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children, who have had tragic experiences before coming to our house. And it helped me understand how messed up our social system is. If you remember reading the story last year about the foster boy in Florida who was "lost" And then the story of "Miranda & Ashley" in Oregon City where SCF ignored multiple complaints of sexual abuse of the man who eventually killed them And this week the film was released, another story in New Jersey of three children who were ignored by the system. One is dead. Apparently the state thought the house they were in was ok because the guardian was employed (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" he used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are so many problems that are highlighted in this film - and they are treated so well by the script and the acting that Antwone Fisher should definitely be a "Best Picture". It doesn't matter if you are adopted or not, it is a stooge that cannot be ignored by anyone who is worried about children in our society.
