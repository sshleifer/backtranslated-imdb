Don't have illusions, this is a story of morality. Granger is the tormented former buffalo hunter, once again attempting to return to the plains from crazy Taylor. Granger can see that the end is near, and feels deeply for the cost of hunting - on the herds, on the Indians and on the earth itself. Taylor, on the other hand, is equivalent to killing buffaloes or Indians to "being with a woman". While the role of Granger of the tortured hunter is superb, it is Taylor who steals the show, like the demented and immoral demon for hurry and joy. There is not much bang-bang here, but the story moves quickly, and we were treated to a good performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is just as touching today, as in 1800, the relationship between man and the earth and what is in it, and racism. Considering when this was done, the Censors must have twisted their handkerchiefs during the scenes in the "obscene house", Taylor's report with the squaw and much of the dialogue. Although late, this is indeed a great Western image.
