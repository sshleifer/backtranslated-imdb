The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought back to the screen and many in the educated world will take note. The director puts us in check with Alexander's story, a sleeping study on chess addiction. Nastasya is on vacation in a resort with marble columns where a chess championship is hosted. Meet Alexander picking up a piece of queen that falls through the coat pocket. A magnetic attraction develops for which he proposes the alarmed mother telegrams to me the next day. Alexander arrives and questions, we pass these fades to the past, 'Godfather II, where we see the young Alexander, a child prodigy. He is taken under the wing of a school teacher and uses his genius for 10 years making huge sums. To think that Alexander has reached its peak, he abandons it but becomes a legend. The old teacher returns to cause damage, trying to give the victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game in which the victory of the world chess champion is a way to immortality, the chess clock marks, the time of the match ends up ending the next day. That day is Nastasya's marriage, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent into crisis. Nastasya, holding his stomach and looking through the coat of his love finds his strategy for the game and follows the moves. Although the film unfortunately sways from his Russian roots, his low-cut clothes are adorable, Alexander plays his role in a sublime way. The director has underestimated the audience, we almost never play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after exchanging queens, isolating the king of the adversaries with your 3 legs and the king, sacrificing the castle for the companion. Nastasya is a great game, but to feel his conclusion deserved more intensity, but perhaps emotions were really under control because chess meant more to him than to her. The Defense of Luzhin elegantly confers honor to Navokov, the complexity of his work in images is a global event not to be missed.
