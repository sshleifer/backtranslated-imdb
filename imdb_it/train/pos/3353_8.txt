This film makes a strong comment on the Italian people of the time. The use of mirrors to improve the revelations of the characters is enchanting and I cannot fail to mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. The way they interact is so beautiful and natural that you can ask yourself if the camera is actually there. The husband, in his brief role, is also excellently portrayed as the Italian Fascist who commands his wife and children but, in his own way, a loving father. The starting scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and position the film historically. I loved the movie and I also agree that it's fun is no longer famous.
