Joan Fontaine plays the villain in this Victorian era movie. She convincingly interprets the married woman who has a lover on the side and fixes her views on a wealthy man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite as good as Miles. Miss Fontaine played her part to perfection: he was both clever, calculating, innocent, frightened and charming. It takes an actress with an extraordinary talent to make it. Joan Fontaine was absolutely splendid in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
