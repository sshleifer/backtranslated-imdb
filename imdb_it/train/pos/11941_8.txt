Journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday" or witty detective William Powell and naughty lady Myrna Loy of Thin Man are not amazed, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur investigators in Scoop. Their reflections are more post-modern than the post-Depression, Allen's writing full of ironic self-irony and simple New York angst. The nuances of the old spirit rarely occur, like when, like Sid, the great magician Splendini, he responds to his background: "I was born in Jewish persuasion, but when I became older I converted to narcissism". Johansson, just released from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, becomes a relatively good, sometimes nosy, journalism student involved in a mysterious murder in London: a serial killer. The plot is a reworking of his recent London thriller Match Point, to the sins of excellence and the "case of the American tragedy" / "Incident" of Place in the Sun. In fact, Allen is rereading Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name just a couple of other examples. I don't care if he reworks; I would like the new material to be at least the same as the originals, and, alas, it is only a reflection of its younger size. <br /> <br /> Allen as a director and actor cannot hide his love for the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore brings a mediocre comedy to an appropriate place along Allen's canon, not exceptional but funny, sometimes brilliantly satirical: about the alleged murderer of the upper class, Sid (Allen) jokes "I would be very surprised if he killed a person." This is the vintage Allen humor. While there are few brilliant literary allusions as in most of his film, he scoops Scoop with music by Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to let us know that the Woodman has not lost his classy touch.
