This was one of my favorite series when I was a child. The Swedish broadcaster has decided to send it again a couple of summers ago, when I had just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs were explained. Of course, some things are simplified, but most have been corrected (even though it was done 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would suggest that all future medical students should watch it. For example, it's a great way to learn some of the basic medical words. Now I'm in my seventh semester and I think I'll watch the series once again as soon as I buy the DVD box :-)
