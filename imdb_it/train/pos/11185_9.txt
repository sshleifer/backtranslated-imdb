Since this is one of the favorite novels, I was very excited to see the move. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are some things I could choose, but I think the film has remained faithful to the book, and it was a really good film. It seems that Stephen King's films are mostly negative, but this is one of the best. It's such a dark story, I guess that's why I like it .. and what's better than the dead man who comes to life ... and also something about animals coming back from the grave is pretty scary. If you saw the film, do yourself a great favor and now read the book !! It is a well written script, the actors could have done a better job (I only say this for Rachel, and Ellie ... she was so whiny) I liked it a lot too, and for me the most important thing .. stuck true with the novel.
