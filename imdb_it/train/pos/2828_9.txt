After tracing it for a year and a half, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing because I'm one of those SMAP fans who have to see all their work and I finally saw the hot Goro movie. But I couldn't believe that Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self, I'm sure he believes he made this film. However, they found the perfect person to seem embarrassed, uncomfortable and half depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Friend, I still can't believe he made this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many parts they don't believe that he really made a film like that .... hahahaha ... . <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I saw it. Thank goodness he grew up ....
