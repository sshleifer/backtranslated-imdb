I found this very moving as Spike and Heaton stay together all the way through this film not to mention that there are not some betrayals along the way. I thought the chase was put aside, the relationship between the two was in the foreground, I believe. I had already sensed that there had been such gay intentions on Heaton's part. My favorite scene had to be where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp and Spike escapes. I generally thought Spike wouldn't come back. I must say that if it were not for our film studio teacher to show us this, I probably would never have seen it. Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of films made in England.
