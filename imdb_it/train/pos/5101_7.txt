John Travolta, the greatest honkeytonk in the world, and a mechanical bull ... what more could you ask for! Yes, you probably won't get many surprises or deep meaning in this. Still, I've always found it pretty nice to watch this redneck love story. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you could expect from a couple of hardcore rednecks. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dance, mechanical bull riding and, of course, the fights required. He has a good soundtrack from 1980, with "Looking for Love on All the Wrong Places", "The Devil went down on Georgia" and "Hello Texas" on my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break your cowboy boots and do a scootin boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4)
