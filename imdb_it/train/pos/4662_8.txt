I just saw Hot Millions on TCM and I completely forgot this gem. Ustinov creates a clever plot and divides that he has cleverly switched from a swindler from two to a genius ... Well, you'll see. Maggie Smith is perfect as the clumsy secretary / neighbor who has a hard time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that runs through this image. Create a refined portrait of a warm, witty and real person who in the long run ... well ... <br /> <br /> Molden and Newhart as top managers face the challenge of making what could be a trivial role and get them out in a comic life on their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know at least that in the case of Romero Ustinov he is extending a helping hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be a hit at the age of rising computers and is a problem for the scammer or the average man, but in reality the characters are so engaging and so fun to watch that the secondary plot of the computer is almost lost ... I almost say. <br /> <br /> Allow yourself to miss the usual expectations of modern comedy and look for great performances and a friendly, indulgent and deeply engaging story in this image.
