The book on which this film is based was excellent; it took a while to understand the unconventional style of Houellebecq, but once I understood the mood behind the script I was completely involved in the sadness of the author. In fact, no other book struck me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has clarified my personal battle and made it more difficult to accept the futility of my own struggle. Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by Harel and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world that rejected him is perfectly represented. This is a film that reveals today's society for the humble man in all his horror. We hope things will change in the future, but for now we have to accept the race for success, as shown in this film. It is probably better that Harel or Houellebecq still do not create such a brilliant work. One is enough for every man.
