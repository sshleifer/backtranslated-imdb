In the winter of 1931, the alleged twelve-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wonders what he does to live the father of his gangster Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan). Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one night, and testifies as he shoots off some rival gangsters. This brings - in a VERY round way - to the "Godfather" - like Paul Newman (in the role of John Rooney) assuming the independent hit man Jude Law (in the role of Harlen Maguire) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks, who are out to cool off in Chicago. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is disconcerting when considering the characters' line of work. <br /> <br /> Looking incredibly like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a magnificent job for director Sam Mendes; and, starting to work with this cast, makes him the youngest actor of 2002. But the most surprising thing about "Road to Perdition" is the extraordinary cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who deservedly won a career with the "Oscar Award" "for the late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is truly superb. This helps to compensate for the general impression of a seasoned measured and invented both for narrative and for graphics. The deviant end is suddenly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned seasonality). <br /> <br /> ******** Road to Perdition (12/7/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
