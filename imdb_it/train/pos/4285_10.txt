This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian writer / screenwriter Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. Still, his appearance of a theatrical drama turned into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece not to be missed (preferably with subtitles and not dubbed). <br /> <br /> In an old bus traveling to the capital Belgrade, a looming war decides the behavior of passengers. Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their song divides and links the stages of this extraordinary road movie (the Kostic brothers in real life are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who is furrowed by the road they give a real performance). <br /> <br /> The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society that faces a war, a vision of the collective person of the nation: everyone is aware that the war is about to begin but they try to live their lives the best who can, hoping that ignorance can avoid tragedy. Using a simple cinematic language, the director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by the previous war (World War I), but also highlights the personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of newlyweds, seriousness of the Great War veteran which is about how to visit his newly enlisted son, and the grim predictions of a man who appears to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especially the songs of Gispsy) and regulated atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature film (Sijan's debut) was just an introduction to a series of directors amateur comedies that will define the Serbian cinematography of the 80s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota", and the favorite "Davitelj protiv davitelja" of my other director).
