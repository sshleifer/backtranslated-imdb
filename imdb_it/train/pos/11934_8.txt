At first you think of another Disney movie, it might be good, but it's a children's film. But when you look at it, you can't help but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is superb and could not play the part better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and perfect for the part. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can't help, but to enjoy this movie! I give him a 10/10!
