This excellent drama made me pause all the time. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second, because every word kept connecting the pieces to this mysterious murder. This film really touched me because it showed how sad and life can be. I really cried at the end (which I don't want to give away!) Also makes me understand how cruel and disgusting they can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only member of the evil cast was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director didn't. I say this because he found someone who didn't look like Anne Marie Fahey herself.
