There are many diseases born in the mind of man who was given life in modern times. The constant vigilance or information accumulated in the kingdom of Pyschosis has kept psychologists, consultants and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last for decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who do not know their remedy or even their existence. This is the premise of the film entitled "The Night Listner". It tells the story of a well-known radio host named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his evenings captivating his audience with vivid stories about gay lifestyles. Perhaps because his show is losing its authentic patina that makes Noon admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks refuge in his profound despair and isolation. He is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches the desperate voice that belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). Reading the boy's heartbreaking manuscript describing early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is fascinated and wants to help. However, things are not as they seem and Noon soon finds himself wrapped up in a fleeting and bizarre tale torn from a medical nightmare. This film is pure Robin Williams and if it were not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this could be comical. Instead, this could prove to be one of William's most serious performances. ***
