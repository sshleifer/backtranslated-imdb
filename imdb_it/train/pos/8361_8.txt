I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up enjoying it. I wouldn't call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and inexcusably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, in particular, women do not want or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way in which two anti-heroes treat every woman they encounter seems unspeakable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that somehow it comes out like a delicious little gem. I'm fascinated by the way Blier managed to get away with it. The film is very funny and very pleasant: it's well written, everyone's acting is first class and the music is sweet and melancholy. Actually, when I think about it, two friends did something good to the women they came across: they prepared a woman on the train (the beautiful and docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her film career with one of the most impressive debuts in "Forbidden Games" (1952) by René Clément at the age of 6) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who finally managed to get a cold Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) out and satisfied; they enlightened and educated the young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her first screen appearances). Their meeting with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I would like to meet Gérard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I enjoyed watching the movie and almost two hours flew by - it was never boring .
