In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom where the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The hostile concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tenacious owner Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) establish strict rules of conduct and Trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors. In the meantime, he visits Simone in the hospital and makes friends with his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that his landlord and his neighbors are plotting to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and gruesome story of paranoia and disappointment. The history and the process of madness and loss of identity of the solitary Trelkovsky develop slowly in a nightmare atmosphere in the macabre position of his apartment, and what is actually happening is totally unpredictable. The performances are fantastic and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Tenant" ("The Tenant")
