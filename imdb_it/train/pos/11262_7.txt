THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second production attempt by Joseph Sarno - and even though I say it's much more fun than the painful and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a bit slow and not explicit for my taste. <br /> <br /> This focuses on a group of vampire girls living in a castle, who want to resurrect their previously murdered "leader". To do this, the girls have to dance naked and kiss and sing strange things - and of course also drink blood. When a doctor and his brother's car break down and have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bank for horny vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... <br /> < br /> THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a good example of a '70s exploit. A lot of nudity - including a few shabby frontal nuances - including incest and, of course, lesbian-bloodsucking ... but these scenes are still quite domesticated by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this would have benefited from more explicit sex, but I guess you can't have everything. He would also have benefited from heavier violence, as this is a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING was to show the skin, not the blood. Still a bit slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that's to be expected from something of this era and this budget. It's worth a look at the fans, others may find it a bit boring for their tastes. 7/10
