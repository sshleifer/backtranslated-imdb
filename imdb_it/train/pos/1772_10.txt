what a relief to discover that I am not imagining this program! the summary from the tax authorities is great. I also remember finding it disturbing and not particularly the vision of the family, I had to be September 11th at the time I looked at it. I think that for a girl who has an attractive age, her hair is very blond and her condition is permanently sad. The theme was played on a flute that I remember - even if I don't remember how it went. I think the introduction showed him that he played it - or maybe he played a flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm destined to never know how it ended or see clips or listen to the melody, but at least now I know it's not just me.
