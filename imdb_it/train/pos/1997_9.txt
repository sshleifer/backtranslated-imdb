As a Dickens fan for life, I was invariably disappointed by the adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his work presented an extremely accurate narrative of human life at all levels of Victorian Britain, a common thread of humor that could be both playful and sarcastic as dictated by the story. In a sense, he was a caricaturist and a literary cartoonist. It could be serious and funny in the same sentence. He preached pride, arrogant arrogance, celebrated modesty and empathy with loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a writer of people. <br /> <br /> And it is the comedy that so often misses its interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist was dramatized in serial form on the BBC. All the misery and cruelty are theirs, but not of humor, irony and wild lightning. The result is only a dark and dismal experience: the story written by a journalist rather than a novelist. It's not Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!', on the other hand, is much closer to the brand. The trick of the bureaucracy is perfectly interpreted, from the puppeteer to the drunk magistrate. The classic stalemate between the janitor and Mr Brownlow, in which the law is described as "an ass, an idiot" could not have been better done. Harry Secombe is the ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But there is also blinding cruelty, the insensitive indifference of the state, the cold, hunger, poverty and solitude are all presented with the same assurance that the Master would have wanted. <br /> <br /> And then there's crime. Ron Moody is a treasure like the squalid Jewish enclosure, while Oliver Reid has perfection with Bill Sykes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not surprisingly, Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from the eastern end of London - takes a liberty with Fagin to reinterpret it as a man far more benign than was Dicken's original. In the novel, he was absolutely ruthless, sending some of his boys to the scaffold to protect himself (even though he was caught and hanged). While in the film, it is presented as something of a rebellious paternal figure, a kind of charitable thief rather than a corruptor of children, the latter being a long-standing anti-Semitic sentiment. Otherwise, very few freedoms are taken with Dickens's original. All the most memorable items are included. Only enough threat and violence are maintained to ensure narrative fidelity and at the same time allow the sensitivity of children. Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye manages to escape drowning and Bill Sykes gets a real graphic triumph. <br /> <br /> Each song is excellent, although they tend to be schmaltz. Mark Lester wonderfully mimics it. Both his and my favorite scene are those in which the world becomes alive for "who will buy". It's schmaltzy, but it's Dickens for everything. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could praise the wonderful set-pieces, the contrast between rich and poor. There is a high level acting by more British regulars than you could shake. <br /> <br /> I should give him 10 points, but today I feel more like Scrooge. Immerse yourself with the Christmas dinner. No original was made better.
