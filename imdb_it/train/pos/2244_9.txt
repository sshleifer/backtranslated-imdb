The only explanation I can understand why this film is not widely distributed is because it strikes too close to home for some. This film was a real happy surprise, satire is brilliant. This film turns on the lights in the dark which is organized by religion and the big media, and the cockroaches hurry to the shelter. Rent the DVD and watch it for yourself if you haven't done it yet, this film is successful where many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to hit his nose in the tent, either using humor or very clever analogies coupled with backdrops revealing places. I cannot comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this film that even the great movie buff will be caught off guard.
