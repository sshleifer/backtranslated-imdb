For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It's the truth. It is the best "bad" film ever. <br /> <br /> The "nastiness" of this film seems to come naturally. Halfway through Satan's opening monologue, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The charming Bridget is a man with a long beard in a wig and a thrift store dress. It takes the eccentric couple who keep trying to kill each other ALWAYS to walk down the stairs. Jesus walks towards the soundtrack of a funk. However, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his job for advising an elder's film project. But it is the sincerity of how ugly it is to make it so wonderful. You have the impression that the producers knew it would be bad, but you never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never be duplicated in wonder, Fatty offers. Highly recommended.
