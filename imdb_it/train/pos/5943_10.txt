This movie is really cool. everything seems to come from the comic. the sets, costumes and plot are fantastic. Clark Bartram is our favorite batman again. he seemed a little better in the dead end, but he still pulls him away. even the superman is fantastic. flight effects are OK. but it's a fan-movie so we can't expect them to be the biggest. the shooting with Superman that captured the car was VERY credible. it was nice. This is a film I would surely see if it were real. has everything you want in a batman / superman movie. an exception though, I would have launched the joker instead of 2-face ..... overall, I gave this film a 10 because it's a great movie.
