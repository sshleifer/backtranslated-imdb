Cambpell Scott is the reader while listening to an audiobook. I was so excited to hear his voice and this disappointed me that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They never seem to keep the good shows on the air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the history of the shows. What a shame and shame on the net for not giving this show a whole chance of seasons. This was an excellent show to watch with a fantastic cast. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second-place witch, it's also a great show, but they took "Invasion" away and that too was something completely different to watch, not the same old old themes. Because networks can't do it well.
