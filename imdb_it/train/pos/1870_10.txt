This movie is fantastic! He touched my cold and stone heart. I could not talk about the racial discrimination that Antwone experienced because I live in my country. I guess it's really hard to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We watched this film in our sociology class at New Era University, and I didn't know it was a true story, I thought it had just been created by an intellectual who wants to take a breath of fresh air into the industry . It's very beautiful. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwone (who was only six) sexually. If I were on his shoes, I could have skipped a ten-story building. I greet him because he is so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He didn't cursed her or anything else, instead he told her about the results obtained in the long years in which they were separated. (I think I'll do it when I get the chance to trace my roots).
