When I heard that Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career with KING SOLOMON'S MINES I was very excited. I was expecting a great action adventure like Indiana Jones. What I got was a 4 hour epic (with commercials) that was very slow. The second and third hours could have been abandoned altogether and the story would not have suffered for this. The ending was good (no spoilers here) but I still wanted more. Well, all a boy can do is prey on Swayze to do "Roadhouse 2" so he can get back to the action genre that made him famous. Until you are a fan of King Solomon's Mines who read the book or watch the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone which is not very good but is the only forty minutes of your life instead of 4 hours .
