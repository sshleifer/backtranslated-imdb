Interesting mix of comments that it would be difficult to add something constructive. Anyway, I'll try. This was an excellent action movie with some great pieces. You will notice that I have specified the genre. I didn't squeak about the lack of characterization and didn't scold the acting. Enjoy if for what it is people, an action film well above the average. I could go on but I made my comment.
