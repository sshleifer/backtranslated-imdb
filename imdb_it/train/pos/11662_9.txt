The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and amazing animated films I've ever seen. Before watching this film, I was convinced that nothing could give a run to his money and that he was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious contender. <br /> <br /> Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the abbot of Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a little too strict and much more interested in fortifying the wall around the city from an imminent attack of Vikings than feeding the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) shows up and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan sets off on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named Aisling who he likes (and saves him) life more than once). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and helps his brother Aidan complete the mystical book which, according to legend, can turn light into light. <br /> <br /> Check out my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
