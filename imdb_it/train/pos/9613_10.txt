It is difficult to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that must be seen to be understood. It follows a more fluid and interesting narrative than any that I've seen recently in a Hollywood version. While his characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and since events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is simply an observer. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the spontaneity of the script will make you glue to the screen, anxiously waiting to see how it all ends. And as for the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to light and beauty, and then to tragedy, all within about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This film is pure magic. Remember why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more quality Bug movies, people will start taking notes.
