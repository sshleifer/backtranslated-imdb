I just saw "Behind Bedroom Doors" and this was the first softcore movie with a solid story that I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Let's start with two nearby couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian appears to be a housewife, James is a lawyer who works as a district attorney, Lillian works in the real estate sector and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do you have all this? Now, let's get inside. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, beautifully played by porn star Chelsea Blue. He is renting the house opposite Fenways and living alone. At the beginning of the film, James looks out the window and sees Abby busy playing with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by prolific porn star Monique Alexander) and secretly starts wondering what it would be like to be with her. The following day, Abby learns of all four, and appears to be a good woman who is living an alternative lifestyle. Switch to Vivian, who looks surprised and says "Oh ... I'm not ... like that". Everything looks fine ... until the plan starts moving <br /> <br /> Before, Abby shows up in Gabe's office, naked, asking Gabe if she should do a tits job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe". "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There is a problem ... let me guess, your wife is at home and does everything you ask, but she's a good girl." "Yup." "Isn't she a bad girl?" "No." "Does that door have a lock?" <br /> <br /> You know what will happen next .... Abby agrees with Gabe, right there in the exam room. After that, he puts a little show in his window for James, who arrives and wastes no time in having sex with her. What James doesn't know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera that records all the festivities (it's still so obvious). Abby has sex again with Gabe later, and this time Gigi joins to make it a threesome. Now that Abby has something in both men, he asks everyone for $ 100,000 to buy his silence. Not only could he ruin James's run for office, but he could destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James struggle with their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian - who "experiences" with women in college. It was a long time ago, but you wouldn't know what to see in action with Abby - he looked like an old professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi follows the plan, she seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having. "It's just business," Abby says. Confessions and excuses will surely follow, as well as some surprising information about Abby's true identity - he seems to have done the same thing to different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight against Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now for sex. The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering that all the women involved in this movie, with the exception of Julia Kruis, have a long pornographic experience, I never expected anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best in the film, with the three routes approaching the second. Monique Alexander remained naked only once, but was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was an important character and stripped the same number of times. I suppose, since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore professionals, she didn't have to have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Behind Bedroom Doors" has a fantastic plot, which has improved the overall rating of the film. I consider them worthy of note. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie - better than her latest offerings in Fred Olen Ray's comedies. At least she can do some drama. scene stealer - she wasn't then as bad as the antagonist, I would have given her an A all by herself, Julia Kruis was her usual self-taught. I wish Monique Alexander had more time to play this film though.)> <br /> Sex: B (scenes of solid and very solid sex, Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost of hardcore quality, even Chelsea Blue looked good in her scenes.) The two offers of girls were not hot, but they warmed the screen.) <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main plot. Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's dramatic turnaround. <br /> <br /> Overall : B (This was a nice softcore movie, I'm glad I was able to see it, because I'm re pleasantly surprised masto: if Chelsea Blue had ever wanted to do more, it would have been always welcome and. This also applies to Nicole Sheridan, although she is probably better at making comedies. I don't care about hardcore girls who can act in softcore movies.)
