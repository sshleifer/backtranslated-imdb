Contrary to those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments and a different view from what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is the best. Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related comments, those behind the Club 700 provide help to those in need, such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical assistance to those living in poor communities and give hope to those who need hope. It is not at all odious. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest you reach the remote control and turn on the channel on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or, for that matter, programs that I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way the ABC Family inserts the disclaimer that the opinions of the Club 700 do not reflect those of the ABC Family.
