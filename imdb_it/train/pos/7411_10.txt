The key to the joy and beauty, the pain and the sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is fundamentally what it is so that we do not constantly struggle against that single irresistible truth. In this way, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity but so difficult to grasp for most of us. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, more than a fairy tale, which is played very well. Watching the actors is like being in a room with real people rather than watching the actors. <br /> <br /> I struggled with writing a review of this beautiful film, so others would be motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in a bathroom. Sounds like a real starting point, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title of this film is The Shower but it's almost an antithesis of an important thematic element in this film, which is the bathroom. I'm still at a loss. Talking about the story or the characters will not do it justice. <br /> <br /> So, I'll just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was. I was also quite amused. I was deeply concerned about the characters and I deeply cared about what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you've been touched by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, make sure you see The Shower. Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality are excellent. I looked at it in the original lanquage with well-made and well-positioned English subtitles. <br /> <br />
