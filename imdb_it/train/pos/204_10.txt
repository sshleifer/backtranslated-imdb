First of all, I don't like almost all of Neil Simon's movies. But there is something in this that is unique, that attracts me and I would say that it is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. The second time I looked at it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, I'm afraid they could sue, so he turned them into men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, the stars of the show are more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my grandmother still living at the age of 97 (she even survived the magnificent imitation of her by Walter Matthau!) Would deny it - but some of you have to find resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow it turned into one of the best support shows I can remember (and my grandmother also enjoyed it, even though she didn't recognize the remarkable similarities he shared with the character of the film). br /> <br /> Very ethnic in flavor, and over the top, you can laugh and laugh or deactivate it. For me, the pleasure remains.
