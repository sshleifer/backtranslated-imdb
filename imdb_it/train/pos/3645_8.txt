A nice story about how to follow your dreams and actually take a stab at doing something about them when the chance hits. Not even easy for Morris - he had a family, a job, a job opportunity, a mortgage, etc. - it wasn't as if he could abandon what he was doing and happily jump on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I'm glad they showed his indecision, almost until he got the call to the majors. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him play against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Even if Morris looks more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid, that's fine. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a great job playing the man, the teacher, the coach and "the oldest novice" .... As someone who is in the same age group, I can certainly identify myself with his situation. You're not too old to do what you dreamed as a child, but it's coming. You have to do it before Lator. <br /> <br /> Well said, welcome, upbeat, recited, nice to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work all around, happy to see him hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would have thought that the Tampa Devil Rays would have been the subject of so much film in advance?
