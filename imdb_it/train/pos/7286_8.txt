I had the pleasure of seeing this photo and I was splendidly surprised by its more erudite features. First of all, the film is undeniably low-cost made with its cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from bad (the two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as the protagonist), to gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) for the first time with Virginia Leith in the title role as a victim without a head alive his will for the benefit of science and the lustful passions of his fianc√©e. The script, however, is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a film of this genre. The issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be fooled by its true intent. It is a squalid story of a man obsessed with his attitude in medical science who wants to fuse his dead girl's head together with the perfect body, thus creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is the sax music that resonates strongly every time the doctor scours the city for female beauties.
