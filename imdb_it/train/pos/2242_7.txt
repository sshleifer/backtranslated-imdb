Partly from the perceived need, one hears to include a conventional romance in the plot to make the film more marketable for a film audience in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some damn funny characterizations of the upper middle class bureaucrats who run the Foreign Ministry - the British are outlawed in the way that only the British can roam themselves. But then, the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. Terry-Thomas as watchable as ever, but the great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers, and others) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> A funny film, but not exceptional.
