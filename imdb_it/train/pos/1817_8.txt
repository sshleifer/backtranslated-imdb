All Dogs Go to Heaven plays on the canine criminal world. The film is a pleasure for children with a comic and dark-but-satisfying storyline and happy with lots of songs and dances. Charlie, another canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead, is outcast. He meets a homeless human girl who looks at him and, through this relationship, realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation loved very much by my eyes as a child. I highly recommend this film to children. I'm not sure how adults would react. (I tried watching it a few years ago on VHS, but those recordings don't last long, do they?)
