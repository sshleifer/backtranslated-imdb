"Deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films coming out of that wonderful decade of the 70s from which many other exploitative films came. <br /> <br /> A group of friends set out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and become victims of a bunch of toothless hillbillies who are almost trying to ruin their lives. Is fantastic. <br /> <br /> We are treated for anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc. A bit like the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" of 1974, to say that "Deliverance" is credible would be immature. This would never happen and could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a very fun and action-packed race. It is one of the many exploitative films that come from the early 1970s and (arguably) sits on top of that pile with its great acting, superb photography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, children.
