Belushi at his most endearing and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. I often think that Belushi is underutilized in Hollywood and this film is one of his best. For those of you watching his TV show, this is a very different and nice character. The film itself is not shocking, nor is the message new, but rather sweet and engaging. The supporting cast of familiar faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's lament can be boring, and Michael Caine's fascinating spiritual guide has a slightly sinister, if not intentional, side. Hamilton, as Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. Moreover, Ren√©e Russo is wasted and not very convincing to the "queen of the dance" who escaped. However, a nice way to spend two hours.
