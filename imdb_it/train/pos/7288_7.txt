This film is an absolute classic for the field. This is why it was a classic of Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a pan with lasagna in his basement as he travels to the city and tries to find her a body by checking the local chicks. At the end he finds a real hourglass body with the head of a chick with the face of a scar at the top. The severed head befriends the failed experiment in the closet and the head comes out of the closet and pierces the remaining "good" arm of the assistant (the other has no reason for a scientist's previous failure), and the whole place burns. <br /> <br /> The film scared us as much as the children that my friend wouldn't go to his basement for a year after seeing him. As children we have classified the scariest films of all time and this was number four. Only one of those scary movies was really good (the original "The Haunting".) <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie a rating of seven for the enormous amount of entertainment value it offers. Its disturbing effect due to the disgusting production and the strange sexual angle when the scientist searches for bodies (with the soundtrack of porn) scares innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it a raw material to watch and laugh. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I'd rather go to the dentist than watch "Chicago". <br /> <br /> Seven is the best I can give you, because its entertainment value is just luck. The film, like the cinema, is a disaster.
