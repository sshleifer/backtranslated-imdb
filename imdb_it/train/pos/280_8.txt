Undying is a great game that introduces some new elements on the tired genre of first person shootings. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert on the occult and a formidable fighter who was summoned by a friend on his estate in Ireland to investigate some strange phainomena. The game is set in Ireland after the First World War, so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. All the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on. Our hero is ambidextrous, so he can use both hands at the same time: cast spells with his right arm and use the his guns with the left. So you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which, as you understand, is very fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are exceptional and can work very well with average power. C. The level design is also beautiful and atmospheric. Mainly the game revolves around the Covenant estate and the villa but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker, the game has an excellent plot and plot (something very rare for a first-person shooter) and I said before about a fantastic and very ghostly atmosphere that dubbing is also good but not excellent. But the game has two main flaws. First of all it's pretty straightforward so when your mission says, for example, going into that room all the doors of the house will be closed apart from those that lead to your mission room, this could save time but limit your freedom to exploration. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiquities may not appeal to most fps players accustomed to high-tech weapons. As for the difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most are of medium difficulty but sometimes it becomes more difficult but not frustratingly difficult. Overall impregnation is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
