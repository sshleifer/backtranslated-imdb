Everyone has bills to pay, including Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discovers that the war is over and are returning home when they identify a group of prisoners of war, including Christopher Walken. After a battle of Max Max 3 (!) Thunderdome and a brief massacre later. Walken and a Colombian boy share a dollar bill promising something or something. <br /> <br /> Cut to the present (1991), and the Colombian boy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. At first he succeeds, but after El Presidente threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to surrender and is hit on the head live on television. This is shown in all the gory details like a flash news on American television, which leads Walken to gather the old team (although in reality it was not part of that team to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and bring down thousands of people . <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all this it is also a good laugh, and also full of action. This is one of those films where logic is given away: how else can Walken shoot a fighter pilot overhead from another plane without undergoing decompression or even breaking a window? Furthermore, it seems that these guys can shoot at drug dealers in New York without the police being worried. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of madness of the b-movie to chew here, from the diabolical acting of Michael Ironside in Vietnam sequence, to the heroic death but completely meaningless of one of the heroes, to the split side of the clash between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the passionate speech of the sister of the rebel leader, seen on television in America (almost brought a brown tear to my eye of hell, a little). <br /> <br /> It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can also locate the crew.
