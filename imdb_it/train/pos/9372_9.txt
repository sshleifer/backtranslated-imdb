Red Rock West is one of those rare films that makes you think of everything that will happen next. Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work. Dennis Hopper is the villain and nobody plays them better. Look for a brief appearance for country singing star Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments. What matters is that you will like this low budget but a high quality effort!
