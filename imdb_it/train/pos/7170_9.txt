HOLES is not your typical Disney stuff - it's very, very funny, even for adults who usually complain about the cutesy, "family entertainment" focus group that the Uncle Walt studio broadcasts as live-action. Perhaps the secret to the success of this film is in its loyalty to the original book, which is a bit more obscure than the average stuff for children. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a male prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of re-calibration. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story is intertwined with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie on a male-only prison camp has the right to be. Jon Voight is particularly bad and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
