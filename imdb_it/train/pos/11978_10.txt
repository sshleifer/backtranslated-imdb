I love the full house so much that I could not live without the full house. Why is it over? The fan is very upset. Can we have a Full House II? Oh come on! But it's better that we have those DVDs to help us. But I need the real ones to invent another episode. Love, the heat is filled the house! All the characters are very cute and beautiful! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse, please come back on the screen please! How is Michelle after falling off a horse? How are Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or does he have a wife or at least a girlfriend? Are they still living in the same house? I want to continue Full House's life! and please don't get mad!
