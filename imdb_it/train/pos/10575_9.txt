Fast, fun, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always exceptional. Blondel fascinates you with its intelligence and energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censorship film from the insinuations in the script, the costumes and the way they touch each other. And the bikinis before there were bikinis! This is no holds barred for everyone. But I do not understand the question of John Garfield. Does it matter if it's in this movie or not? If it is, the screen is so short that it is basically a prop. You need to look at it frame by frame to find it even if it is there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen him before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it by wonderful accident. Sit down and enjoy the journey!
