The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was excellent, the pyrotechnic effects were masterfully realized, and it takes a story of the basic love triangle and a science fiction element is added. I could identify with many of the characters and their motivations have made the logical sense rational in the structure of the story. <br /> <br /> The work with the camera was exceptional, the audio clear and precise, the background music perfectly selected for the effect, the firefighters singing a strange oddity of talent, the genial sets special effects performed with an expert talent. <br /> <br /> I am a bit confused as a whole mini-carnival in the parking lot of a chain store the lot could be fed by a single socket of the lamppost. It seems impossible to say the least. However, the struggle between the brothers towards the end of the film was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was also a wonderful touch, as he played the semi-serious role of a carny very well.
