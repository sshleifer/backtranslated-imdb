Being that this movie has a lot of excellent entertainment qualities I think it should be a little more credit than what was given on imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your fundamental 'who did it?' thriller with sex and murder but continues to guess until the end. I like these types of films and I certainly think this meets the standard. For me it was worth watching it more than once so I'll give an 8 on imdb.
