Pushing Daisies is just an enchanting fairy tale, with the shades of aesthetics and romanticism of "Amelie". He has a beautiful palette, his well thought out and detailed shots, his extravagant and too polite names and dialogues to be real, his fantastic imagination and deep romanticism. <br /> <br /> Watch the blue in the sky pop out to you, as the blue cannot be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Watch a strangely natural and totally satisfying song come out of a scene. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is wonderful, the cast is extremely nice, there is great music and the two most important stars cannot touch or die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I wanted them to find a way around this, but c'est la vie). <br /> <br /> It's simply a show that it's a pleasure to spend an hour with, and I highly recommend it. There has been no other television quite similar, and I'd like to see more. He put me through a flu in a nasty week, since he's a good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
