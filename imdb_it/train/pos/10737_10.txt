If you didn't know it, it's almost like it was staged, but it wasn't. It was set up perfectly, and the way they got the whole movie is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11th 2001 were well collected in this documentary and the classic movie that made this film an unfortunate classic. Only the story in the film alone should make it a MUST for any American or person touched by the September 11 tragedy.
