Jean Harlow and Clark Gable have been a great team on screen and this could be their best film together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be trivial and predictable, but that's not what I love about the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful. It's obvious that he really enjoyed working together and that's part of what makes this film so wonderful. <br /> <br /> The witty dialogue, the fantastic script and attention to detail are the other things that make this movie so beautiful. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and in every subsequent vision I noticed at least one new detail. For me, this is a great movie brand. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and script are better than most films of this period (early 1930s). I love classic films, but I admit that most of them are just mediocre and sometimes I don't care. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-code" movie. (The Hays code was not applied until one year after Hold Your Man.) This film could not have been made under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank God the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we would have lost this gem.
