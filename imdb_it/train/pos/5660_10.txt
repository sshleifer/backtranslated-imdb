Maybe I saw an episode or 2 when the show was originally broadcast, but when I saw 1 episode on netflix I was also captured. I saw the whole series in about 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. First he is deeply reprehensible, so he starts to like the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His people, Andy Griffith, meets Charles Manson meets Satan is fantastic. Fascinating, charismatic, slender, and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind of" I mean "really". I want to be like HIM when I grow up. Lucas Black is also fantastic. Even the accents are fantastic. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.
