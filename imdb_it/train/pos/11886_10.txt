I loved this movie. First, because it's a family film. Secondly, because it offers a refreshing idea to manage HIV news in a family, with much less hysteria than I have normally seen in movies. The brothers are very close, but do not judge. Their desire to protect their younger brother is noble, but not necessary in the end. I understand that Leo's choice of how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular among people, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can't believe this was a French television program. It had great production values. I gave this film a ten, and I think you will too, once you've seen it.
