A charming little film, certainly, but superb. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this first showcase for her British accent, and the cast has gathered around her to start the dialogue. This came out in the Senso and Sensitivity period, and I'm sure I don't know why that has garnered all the attention of the Oscars. Emma is the most accessible and least cool story of Jane Austen, well told.
