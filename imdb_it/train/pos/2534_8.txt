Scientist working frantically in solitude finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor that carries a new radioactive element. All the discourses on science (pseudo) and innovative technology of the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any disease if properly harnessed. When he calls his rivals - who have excluded him from the scientific community and ridiculed - to witness his discovery, they propose a "joint" expedition to Africa ... naturally they end up stealing a lot from Dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only a residual credit. In addition to that, a weak effeminate who looks like a supportive comedian of the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. The young wife Rukh's trophy (Drake), who falls at breakneck speed for that piece of a human being. Having horns grown like a deer would not have done the dr. Rukh (Karloff) every friendly one, so he embarks on an undercover revenge mission ... killing 2 of his enemies and Dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who had helped him ... finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark on his revenge to begin but (to my utmost dissatisfaction) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being been married. Acting is mostly satisfying, with Karloff & Lugosi very good. Check out the hysterical waitress scene ... Other characters are not worthy of mention ... Recommended, just like ALL the old universal horrors ...
