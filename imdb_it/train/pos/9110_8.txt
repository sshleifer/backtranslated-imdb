You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... Until what happened on April 25th 1974, our freedom was limited, we had no freedom of speech, but when we came to the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people have lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom to word! This is a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think he has some mistake in acting, but from the way I watch Portuguese movies it's pretty good !! I really like!
