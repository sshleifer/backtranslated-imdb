Malefique practically has the viewer from beginning to end with its angular atmosphere. Almost the entire film is set in a prison cell that revolves around 4 characters whose transvestite Marcus and his retarded little boy are the strangest way. Soon the detainees will find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick that deals with his obsession with the themes of the occult and black magic that lead to his escape from the cell. From here on, everything takes care of discovering the secret of the book and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to some incidents in the exit from the cell towards the unknown light. <br /> <br /> I honestly think that the story is rather poor and the final touch is beautiful, but for me the ends are rather tied together. However, I was thrilled until the last moment because the film's atmosphere is unique with minimal settings and casts. The killings are raw and mysterious ... it does not take cold blood to freeze the spine and even the hidden themes are very well done and they reminded me of the Hell themes in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold feeling dirty with greenish shades. Sometimes you wonder if the real or occult world depicted here is more strange ... when the retarded boy loses his fingers and is lulled to sleep by sucking Marcus' breast, it seems normal, so how strange can a light gate be freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and fries the viewer in a very different way than most of the shockers of the genre. I just hope the story has led to a more coherent ending. Different elements such as the visitor with the camera, the other prisoners obsessed with books and the toy doll that points vaguely towards the end do not adapt closely to the plot. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other films by director Valette, even if it's a turning point to see that he's doing a Hollywood remake of "One missed call" that was already worn out and useless already in Miike's version.
