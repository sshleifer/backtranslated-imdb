Do you like the really inventive comedy or do you like "marriage crashes", if the answer is the second one it stops reading now. I can't believe this movie is no longer voted. Basically Meadows plays a character no different from Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. From crudeness - Leon playing with himself on the porch, the former boyfriend deceived to eat. . Oh good. To sex inspired by madness, to the Broadway routine, to the voice. The lawns are as big as the infant lion, but very sweet. Some big lines "don't blame the wang" too many "world of a crazy world crazy". . . Because this film was not immense is a mystery. Great comedy
