Good for the Czechs, their once powerful film industry seems to wake up from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy made with all the elements one would expect to see in a modern production of "hollywood" minus the garbage that seems to become attached to the genre in recent years. Superb soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague cityscape, to name a few. <br /> <br /> The story is actually composed of several sub-stories that often intertwine and overlap, in essence it is a collage of destinies, destinies, desires ... A group of urban people follows from young to mid thirties through a variety of situations ranging from everyday life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions. And it's hilly. In reality there is a point in the film where the entire theater in which I was (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed relentlessly for about 40-50 seconds. How many times have you experimented with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the entire main cast is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonian star Labina Mitevska as an immigrant facing family difficulties). I have to locate Jiri Machacek for his incredibly credible portrait of Jakub, a bohemian constantly stoned whose brain is severely influenced by the things he smokes that land him in a myriad of funny situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: don't miss this! It has a lot to offer.
