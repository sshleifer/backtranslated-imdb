Return To The 3th Chamber is the epic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and an impressive fighter. In this sequel Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after making his friends beat. Imitate the original Shan Te, look for all sorts of tricks to enter the Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually get some unique skills to fight some bossy bosses. It is a classic story of martial arts with a light heart, with the production values ​​of the Shaw Brothers and the sure direction of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic everywhere, both for the combat comedy or slapstick, and for the performance of Gordon Liu, as are the others, in particular the nice monk works perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some of the other movie stars and there are certainly bigger, more violent and overwhelming Shaw Brothers films. But few have a magical mixture of slapstick, training and unique fights, with a subtle but warm tale of a useless boy who is doing good. Full of light joy, it is impossible not to give this the highest score.
