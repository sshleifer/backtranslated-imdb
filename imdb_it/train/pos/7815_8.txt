'Cry Freedom' is a film about how people will go far to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first semester is an interesting portrait of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and publisher Don Woods (fanatically played by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods in search of answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people prefer the first half of the film focused on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. I found out that the second half of Don Wood struggles to make Biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting.
