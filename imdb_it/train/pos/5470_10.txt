BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" films before the code. It was shown last night, after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the film as it is now with four more minutes restored. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where he may have known the drunken parents of "Myra" - Mae Clarke - in the WATERLOO BRIDGE). His father is Robert Barrett. He has lived with him since his mother's death, and (in the restored dialogue) has been doing it as a prostitute since he was 14 years old. Now he is a resident waitress and part-time bitch in his speakeasy, his closest friend is Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American servant Barrett continues to bully. It is one of the two positive points of Stanwyck's personality that she continues to keep up with her father on Harris, threatening to leave if Harris is fired (and since they are dirty workers like Nat Pendleton, who like to see Stanwyck serve them, rather than the taste of the dog that serves that brings them, Barrett has to obey her. <br /> <br /> The only guy who regularly comes to the speakeasy who likes Stanwyck is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who sees great potential in the lively girl if she leaves her simply abandoned at home. She is also pushing the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche and the idea of ​​the will to power. Learn more about this later. <br /> <br /> After putting out of action the local political bigwig (Arthur Hohl), and discussing this with Barrett, a continuous explosion kills Barrett and allows Stanwyck to leave his hometown. She and Harris head to New York City, getting free transport from a rail freight wagon by sleeping with a brakeman (James Murray). They reach New York and, after walking, they see the Gotham Trust Company (founded in 1873), and the friendly guard tells them where the personnel office is. <br /> <br /> We slowly watch Stanwyck rise to the corporate ladder up to the superior, similar (but more unfair) than Robert Morse dared in HOW SUCCESSFULLY ACTIVATED WITHOUT ACTUALLY TRIED. But Morse was a man in a man-dominated company. Stanwyck knows his sexual charm is his weapon. It runs through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a part of the film that I always thought the most shocking - curiously enough - when I saw it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Everyone ends up falling in love with her and is pushed aside when she is no longer useful or destroyed by her. Brent, the new president of the bank founded by his grandfather, eventually marries her - and the film's crisis occurs when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent bought her a fortune in jewelry and gave her precious bonds). Brent is indicted. Will she come forward for him? <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING UP: <br /> <br /> The only thing about these films that is not allowed is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated the endings. The original ending took Stanwyck of a ship to Europe, abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing that he could not do it to him, return to their home and find that he had shot himself. He's going to the hospital with him at the end. Now, before the film was found, the film ended up apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it, and retire to East St. Louis, to live happily if they were poor. <br /> <br /> of these are good purposes. Stanwyck should continue his destructive course, with Brent the last of his victims. But even without the Breen office the writers (one is Darryl Zanuck, by the way) considered it appropriate to let him find a moral center. He has none - at least none for powerful men (whom she hates). I don't think a public of depression would have tolerated that kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, due to changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was a man's world in the business world in 1933, so Stanwyck has his work cut out for her. Wood (when he is fired for an indiscretion with him) admits that he didn't want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck would find women everywhere. In the film there are unpleasant and irritable comments (obviously some based on jealousy) against Stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees in his rapid ascent. In 2006, she was often confronted with superior women, and she would find them cutting her legs very quickly. Of course, if he finds that one or two are lesbians, he might try that route, but it's doubtful. And she also never seems to meet gay men. They have male gay executives in business who don't care about his legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there's his mentor, Mr Cragg. Cragg is redone in the "bowdlerized" version in an attempt to make it look for a moral center. In reality he pushes Nieztsche, but the way (broadly speaking) of the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - to find a way to feed him and push him. While at times Nieztsche exercised the power of stress, it was not the essence and the end of all his theories. Otherwise nobody would read it today in university courses. Cragg is obviously self-educated, but only half polite. In short, if someone who had thoroughly studied Nieztsche faced Cragg, he made him look half-polite mad. And this is Stanwyck's mentor! A good movie, and for his day is worth a 10 ... but seriously flawed one.
