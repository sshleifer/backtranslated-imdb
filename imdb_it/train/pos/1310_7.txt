** SPOILERS ** Load a police killer's drama around the town of Riverside Wisconsin a lot. Who is tracked down by the local police using policewoman Gina Pulasky, Helen Hunt, as a covert bait to catch him. <br /> <br /> Nothing new in this TV movie you've never seen, but the depth of the acting and the script is unusually good and brings out not only the killer but also the policewoman, like her friend, cop, lover, state of mind. <br /> <br /> After being placed under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable assailant, who attacked his partner with a rifle. Officer Palusky is tasked with going undercover to approach murder suspect Kayle Timler, Steven Webber. After being positively identified by the girl Sahsa, Kim Kluznick, who saw him not far from where little Timmy Curtis was found stabbed, 18 times, to death the next day. <br /> <br /> Getting a job at Mr. "C" Diner where Tim works Gina becomes very friendly with him and later tells him, to have Tim open, about him that he could be the serial killer who has killed in a surprise accident. a 79-year-old woman. <br /> <br /> Tim who is said to have a brilliant IQ does not seem to resume Gina's attempt to trap him even when he later sees her in a bowling alley with his fellow cops spending a night out. At one point, playing some strange cat and mouse game with his Tim, Gina, with a knife, admits that it is wired. But Gina tells him that she was forced to do so by the police to get a break and an early release from prison. In addition to Tim's instability and criminal actions, we discover that Gina is not all there. She seems to suffer from being rejected by her father who left her, with a drunk and abused mother, as a teenager who is doing her job as an undercover policewoman. <br /> <br /> There is also the fact that Gina's lover cop, Will McCaid (Jeff Fahey), who is estranged from his wife and two children, which is also in the serial murder case is too overprotective of her . This means that Gina almost suffocates the cover and that the task has been removed. <br /> <br /> Put back in service under cover by its head Capt. Cheney (Dan Conway), after official McCaid's objections, after another boy, twelve-year-old Davy Marish, was found murdered, Gina finally recovers together and lets Tim admit that he is the person responsible for the series of murders in area. Gina does it by having a hidden recorder that has replaced what she gave her to show how honest she is, hidden on her. <br /> <br /> The movie "In the Company of Darkness" was not really exceptional but the acting of Helen Hunt, Jeff Fahey and especially Steven Webber. It was these high level performances that raised the film well above the average that TV movies were used to seeing.
