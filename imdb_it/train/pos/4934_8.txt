"Panic in the Streets" is a small, rather unknown film by director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces like "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan had already won an Oscar in 1947, before this film, so it was not entirely unknown at the time. Still "Panic in the Streets" is mainly a film that went under the radar. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is the Oscar-winning screenplay. He has an excellent concept and his excellent thriller material with a preview of crime / film noir elements. Also the dialogue in this film is absolutely magnificent and gives the film a feeling of realism and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is quite unknown (especially at the time of release) but still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first film roles. Especially Palance impresses like the gangster boss, with a very powerful-looking face. <br /> <br /> Again the film drags a bit in some places. The film starts very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of rhythm and point of view of the story. <br /> <br /> Yet, "Panico in the Streets" remains a perfectly watchable film, mainly due to its solid script and the powerful dialogue that makes the film credible to watch. For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
