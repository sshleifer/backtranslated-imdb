Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great film, not only in the year it was shot, but also now. It is an art film that is not obsolete even in the 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative ability and made the story so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the next French film of the new wave: "Femme d'a Cote" by Francois Truffaut which is of similar theme.
