I saw that at least some people watched it on September 2nd on TCM. If you knew it, Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this film when she arrived in the United States. It was a huge scandal and I learned that the original version in the United States was so downcast by the censorship that it was practically unintelligible. I looked at why I had just seen a documentary about "bad women", actresses in the United States TV drama censorship council set up in the early 30s. It seemed to me that they fared more than Hedy's most "sensational" shots in "Ecstasy". Indeed Hedy was quite innocent in this, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her pristine beauty first. It was a nice opera film to relax on. I loved him for what he was: a simple love story. I watched it after recording it before during an insomnia of A.M. I'd like to see the first version released in the United States for comparison purposes.
