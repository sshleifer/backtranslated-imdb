This film is fun and suitable for any age. It is definitely family type entertainment. The cast does a great job with the Mid-Western people of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must suppose that nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the Interstate. The position seems appropriately boring and totally unlikely for the Martians to invade the land. But these Martians are totally inept, despite being well equipped with an arsenal of appropriately horrible and deadly weapons ... including a set to uproot even the Martians! The Martians silence their lines and introduce the right accents to make us spectators and the locals want to help them ... leave the earth. J. J. Anderson, who plays the very young Halloween carnivorous duck, has only broad lines. Watch this movie for laughter and entertainment; stimulant that is not. But it's thin and fun.
