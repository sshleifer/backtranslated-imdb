A true comedy farce of screaming situations of the mid-1970s this film was a HUGE success for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly amazed by some comedy films that are a great release a week and then vanish: HIGH ANXIETY, THE ECONOMIC DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT WATCH NOW WE ARE DOWNLOADING ........ and have no profile today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in which every year 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh about it and then never talk about it again. Famous for having been shot on videotapes and transferred to film, an experiment of the time, NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect wardrobe that slams the farce that the Farrelly brothers should look at today. Had they done so in the first place, there would have been no complaints about its content and its orientation. It is very funny and YES very rude and hilarious all wrong. Just like it should be. In fact, like a groovy 1976 movie with all those horror colors and clothes, today it works better.
