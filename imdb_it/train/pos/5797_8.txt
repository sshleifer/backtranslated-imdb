And I don't say it badly. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins ​​it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've seen this movie aired a few times, but I've always changed channels. Even seeing a few seconds would bring that feeling of magic back and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So I only saw this movie once and I think it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I had seen it today, I know I couldn't help but criticize MJ's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see that my adult self intervenes in my vote and gives him an 8 for memories and wonderful music. For that little boy who looked at him with awe 20 years ago, this is certainly worthy of a 10.
