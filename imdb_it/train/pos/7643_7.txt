Spoilers !!! This film is based on the concept of What If? Obviously Mr Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character spends a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos theory states that a butterfly in China could have an effect on someone here from a chain reaction. The objective of this film is based on an event during a baseball game. This event sets one's destiny in motion; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect", except that Mr. Destiny uses comedy about drama. The results make a film fresh, a little original. If your philosopher is in tune with "The Butterfly Effect" you will probably like Mr. Destiny. I give him a 7 out of 10. Incredible because I saw the first half of this movie 3 times, and finally saw the final on TBS.
