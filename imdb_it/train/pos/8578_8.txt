This film is one of the best American B movies of the 90s. If you are looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, a lot of laughs and a tongue in an ironic tone for the gangsters fighting, it's worth watching. Everyone chews up the scenery a bit, but this is the film, and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to make another film together.
