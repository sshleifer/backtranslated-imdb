Not having seen the previous two in the Bourne film trilogy, I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However it was a really thrilling experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening for not having seen the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful and compelling film, especially an action movie. Since I usually avoid action movies and thrillers, this was great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most compelling films, drawing your attention from the first second to the last minute before the launch of the titles. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just as fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot of his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this fabulous actor still has one to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his films in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were handled with style - each one was brilliantly realized and I was shocked by the awesome of this movie. Very well.
