I must admit, at the beginning I did not expect anything good, at all. I was just expecting a tacky movie that promoted the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I'm happy to say that it has much more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is not exceptional, but it doesn't suck either, the cast is well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters. The effects lack consistency, but the action scenes are quite satisfying. <br /> <br /> What really fascinated me was the essence of the plot, even if it combines fantastic elements, it also shows a harsh reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and their feelings have really won me over and I think it's the key to this film. It makes you think and does well to convey all the anguish. <br /> <br /> Satisfies all expectations for good drama. I would certainly recommend it to everyone.
