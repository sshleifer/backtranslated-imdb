What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to stick together at first - is our desire to know if Martinaud did the dirty deed. Without ruining so much, obviously there is a red herring and a turn. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping. When there is revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think that it is the sick pedophile, perverted that we are predisposed to think. One of the things he has to face is the distant gap that he and his wife have even if they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, were accomplished in the film's shocking ending. <br /> <br /> This film requires your patience and has definitely tried those of restless teenagers sitting in the back. Obviously they were talking because they weren't partial to "central location" movies. Although there is a bit of traveling, when we get to the woods and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as smart as we are made to think he is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
