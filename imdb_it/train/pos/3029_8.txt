The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Greene wrote; for example the silent but gloomy humor that breaks into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession of a murdered child who takes over part of the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to ridicule. <br /> <br /> However I don't want to suggest that the film is somehow bad. It always seems the part and the story remains in the mind like a good one. Some of the minor characters were serial actors who could turn over anything. <br /> <br /> It is terribly shameful that the film is not available on DVD.
