I have NOT seen this movie, but I have to. After reading all three of Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that Peruvians have emigrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this crew had no GPS, and only an old radio valve (tube) with a 6-watt output, their journey was nothing short of heroic. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
