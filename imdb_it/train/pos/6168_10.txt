Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film that she plays a secretary at the main character's bank. It has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant. There is more information on his website> After declaring my personal interest in the film, I must say that I think it is a beautiful, moving, funny and well-made film.
