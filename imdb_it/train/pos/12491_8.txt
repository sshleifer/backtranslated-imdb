This film was very good. If you are one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good, although I thought that the actress who plays Julie could have more emotions behind her jokes. Allan was very good and I thought that photography was incredible. I was on the edge of my place all the time while my friends were freaking out and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and should have arrived on the big screen. I give him two thumbs! I would definitely say that if you haven't already seen it, then rent it. If you saw it and didn't like it, go look at it again because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how much of the film was shot around and on my school campus.
