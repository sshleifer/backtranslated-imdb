This is the Columbo directed by Steven Spielberg at first in his career. It's nothing sensational, but in this film you can see a little hint of great things for Spielberg. The film is essentially in the same style as most of Spierlberg's films and television work of the 1970s. This means that some characters tend to show some weirdness and no, I'm not just talking about the Columbo character. That kind of extravagance of the character that perhaps can best be seen in Spielberg's 1975 film "Jaws". But apart from a few hints of Spielberg's typical early elements, this film cannot be called the work and fine example of a director's rising star. It's not bad, of course it's not, but like I said before, it's not too sensational either. <br /> <br /> This film started very well and very promising, but after it was opened, where the murder always happened, the film became a bit slower and even boring to watch. Boring because it is above all a book by Columbo that has no real memorable moments, not boring because it is a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was brilliant enough and the concept of having a criminal story writer who killed his writing partner showed great potential. However, history has not explored all its possibilities. At least this is the feeling that this film left me. <br /> <br /> The film was still nice to look at thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he is smarter than Columbo, due to his mystery / crime writing experiences and trying to give him all kinds of possible suggestions, taking away from himself. But obviously Columbo knows it better and is his suspected number one from the first moment, but as usual he plays the game. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and uses a good camera position and modification. It's funny to see that even most of this was mostly consistent with Spielberg's later work, especially some of the camera's corners. <br /> <br /> An excellent and perfectly watchable Columbo film, but don't let Spielberg's name be attached to raising your expectations too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
