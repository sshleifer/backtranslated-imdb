So what constitutes a real independent film? On a day when the latest mainstream Hollywood fashion must appear solid and avant-garde, I'm sorry to say that what the public tends to perceive as an independent film is usually nothing but a clever marketing maneuver. <Br /> <br /> That's why we should be happy that there are films like "One-Minute Hate". Throughout the forum, this film highlights the contradictory nature of his model (independent horror film). He loves it or hates it, "Hatred" is not afraid to be what it is, and in watching this film, one gets the feeling that Kallio (the director) has not only made this film to spray fake blood all over the place, it is in this to tell stories. Good ones. You can find this film in the horror section of your video store, but don't be fooled, this story also speaks of love, of good people pushed over the edge and that light so far away at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect a grimace, or a repulsive Evil Dead, stay away from this movie. But if you point to the finer points of the horror / suspense genres, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this film, and I'm sure he's proud to tell everyone he's not "Evil Dead". Bruce never tried to cash in his "ash" image, and it's obvious he wasn't involved with "Hatred" so he could do it. <br /> <br /> My advice, though, to all Dead-ites that angrily devoured all that was published by Mr. Campbell is to still check this movie and see what else they are trying to show you Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell. <br /> <br /> The acting is well done, although nothing about this film is oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's nice to see compassionate performances in a horror movie. Very often, actors in films like these do not even seem to try, with "Hatred", it seemed that all the actors took their classes very seriously, without ever resorting to the typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hatred" is as competent as the independent film. Editing is fast, cinematography is good given the budget, and "Hatred" maintains a fast pace, with no storm points or ugly anti-climaxes. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hate may not have looked over all those fake, million-dollar Indians, but personally, I don't see a problem with this. It is a film of people who really care about the medium. The people who reached their inside broke their ass pockets, pulled out their nickles and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a good movie. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this.
