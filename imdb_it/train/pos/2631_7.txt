If The Lion King is a serious story about a young lion raised to avenge his father's death, The Lion King 1 and a half is the exact opposite, full of extravagance and joy. The lion king told the story from the side of the young lion Simba, 1 and a half is from the point of view of Timone and Pumbaa, a non-perfect duo composed of a meercat who left the house because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors of home and a warthog who has an odor problem. The film is a bit short on substance, but Disney does a good job of filling the time with various sketches played by Timone and Pumbaa as they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is the sing-along that happens in the middle of the movie, make sure you watch the bouncing bug! Disney has advertised one and a half times as "the rest of the story", although in reality it is not. It's just a different perspective on The Lion King, without all the serious stuff that has pervaded most of the second half of the original Disney classic. The credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their vocal work, without their efforts, the film may not have worked. They sing, entertain and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
