This was Eddie Robinson's 101st film and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after filming ended. All this makes his key scene in the film even more touching. <br /> <br /> Although some hair and clothing styles are a little dated (note also the video game shown in the film), but the subject of the film is practically timeless. Heston said he wanted to make the film for a while because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie a classic. The plot is solid. <br /> <br /> The acting is first-rate, particularly the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with beautiful performances also by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The mixture of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky combined with the visual pastoral elements make some scenes truly moving. This was the icing on the cake for the film. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or "point") of the film is significant. Yes, it's a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note it's a warning about what can go wrong with man's management of the Earth. It is in the subtext that you find the true message of the film. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present) and how Thorn is unable to understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my best films science fiction of all time.
