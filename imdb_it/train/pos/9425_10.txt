A series of super-comedies from the 90s (two series were made in total) that suffered in the UK rankings due to poor programming. When you come across established comedies like "Minder", even the best new comedies will struggle to get noticed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I took the series from episode one and followed it avidly. I mentioned it to friends and relatives at the time, but it seemed that everyone had looked at something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot it. <br /> <br /> Then I searched the internet and found out that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released "on their own". <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
