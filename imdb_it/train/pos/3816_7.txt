"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It describes the super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city and the experiences of the main character who interact with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ("Secret Sunshine" in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. He chose Milyang because his late husband (killed in a car accident) was born there and feels he has to start over in a new place. He does not react well to the openings of local Christian zealots, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and to prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and wipes out these people as politely as possible. In fact, at some point she nearly touches everyone in Milyang, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say the least would give away the film, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is wonderful. Having read that she won the award for best actress at Cannes in 2007, I expected a decent job. But Mrs. Jeon is endearing and it's impossible to take her eyes off her when she's on the screen. The film is a sort of heartbreaking work by Evelyn Waugh, which shows how fate may seem crazy as it is strangely inevitable.
