As a big Prince fan of the last three or four years, I can't really believe I just started watching "Purple Rain". The brand new special 2-disk anniversary edition led me to buy it. Wow, I really couldn't wait to see it, but I wasn't prepared for how electric it actually was. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are nothing short of stunning - he REALLY moves into this. I am very familiar (from repeated plays) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all his songs, but seeing them in the context of the film completely alters your perception of melodies and lyrics - such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself. There is something indescribably mesmerizing in the scenes in which Prince and The Revolution perform. The BABY closing songs I'm A STAR and WALLD PERE FOR U show how much energy and pure talent of Prince overflowed in the mid-20s (it's overflowing!), It upset me. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - take her to a lake, let her jump in, then run away - absolutely hilarious things from the past. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very 80s and unintentionally funny but this adds charm to the film. Morris Day is the most beautiful cat in the block (and fun), and when his group The Time plays THE BIRD, see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the Minneapolis style stage - I love dancing in this piece, and as Benton offers to Morris a mirror in the middle of the show. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see it again, I really can't! The extras are fantastic - especially seeing a young Eddie Murphy, the pre-Beverly Hills cop, admit to being a "prince groupie".
