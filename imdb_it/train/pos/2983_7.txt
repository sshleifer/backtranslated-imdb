BASEketball is really a really fun movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh again, in a very silly but often clever comedy. <br /> <br /> The 2 creators of South Park, the main actors of this film, play very well, actually surprisingly good, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The film often reminded me of South Park - one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> It's a really good and fun movie, so don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 out of 10.
