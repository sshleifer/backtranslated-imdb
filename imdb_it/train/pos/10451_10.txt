"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and must be among my 5 favorite movies of all time. Dialogue and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in the film does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and you cannot reach all the places in one night, both (especially if you are a foreigner and it is your first night in Vienna). But this is not the point. The relationship between the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Even if nothing ever happens, the film never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you don't like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the summer sequel. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
