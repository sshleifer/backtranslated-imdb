I loved it. In fact, if I see it again (and I'm going to do it), I might just love it. I will echo other reviewers to say that this movie really grows on you as you watch. It starts slowly, but the way it wraps is very natural and has a mood. You've just entered it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer atmosphere of the film and I thought the film was very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of realism and the film very slowly and delicately weaves a spell while you get involved in the various interactions between them all and you want to know how it will end and which paths the characters will choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are fewer than a dozen comments on this - there are obscure TV movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I will do Let's say that I missed the final that is driving me crazy and I MUST watch it again to see it. This is a film that may not be suitable for everyone, but which I consider strongly undervalued (even some of my most purist film friends who have seen almost all the movies have not seen it) and do not even seem to have much of a bulletin board but I liked it a lot and everyone who loves family dramas warming up on the scene, the atmosphere and a languid rhythm without haste should probably take a look at it. Above all it is noteworthy that it takes place in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the south, and the movies that take place there, this is a gem. I will add my vote to the few comments and suggest this little-known film.
