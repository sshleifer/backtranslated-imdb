I love this movie, I saw it again last week after about 3 years. This film is perfect, great acting, great history, great direction / room-work / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. pity jaco van dormael has not made more films after this. The first 5 jobs. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today, 3 years and 3 days have passed since the comment above. it was never published because it was no more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. This is undoubtedly in my top 3 film together with "Cinema Paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. Even the soundtrack is really good. I'm really curious about the new "jaco von dormael" movie. I hope you will complete my top 3 movie. If you see this movie, let's rent it. Or even better. Buy. Because you'll want to see it again.
