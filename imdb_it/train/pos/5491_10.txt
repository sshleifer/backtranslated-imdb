Although we know how the story ends, it is a compelling "fly-on-the-wall" film that sounds almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic man, bigger than life, who has an indissoluble bond with the mestizos who make up 80% of the population, but have previously been excluded from the political process of Venezuela and the its oil wealth. He looks as devoted to them as they are for him. He travels the country at a frenetic pace, reaching the campesinos, turning to large crowds, embracing and kissing the common people, accepting letters on pieces of paper and listening to requests for help. People are excited that one of them has arrived at the highest office in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that changes for the better is coming to the barrios they celebrate. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The Spanish elites of purely bloody blood who are a small minority but have previously controlled all wealth are full of bitterness and resentment. One of the film's most unwittingly amusing moments is when a person who looks like Ann Coulter, in a meeting of residents in an exclusive private community, complains about the mestizos, "have no concept of struggle or sacrifice". A few minutes later, a speaker tells the meeting to "pay attention to the servants - they could be Chavez supporters". Duh! Of course I am. <br /> <br /> In a late-night interview alone with the film crew, Chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. He can be a sensitive and poetic person, albeit with a mischievous, even funny sense of humor (as we saw when he turned to the United Nations and called Bush the devil.) <br /> <br /> So the storm force begins to gather as the coup organizers call for mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters to change course at the last minute and march on the presidential palace, knowing that he is surrounded by Chavez supporters and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot falls into place as the snipers on the roofs start firing on Chavez's supporters, some of whom shoot back. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and states that Chavez supporters are massacring protesters. Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the road is empty! The protesters have taken a different path. Needless to say, the footage of the deserted street was modified by the angry private anti-Chavez television stations (which had aired a constant burst of propaganda that called Chavez mentally ill and sexually staring at Fidel Castro). Immediately after the coup, we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly boast on TV how they manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers continue to be at the center of this chaotic, rapidly evolving situation as the military coup surrounding the palace threatens to bomb it. Chavez finally surrenders to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is taken away to an offshore island where a plane waits to take him - where? The United States? How can the remaining members of the government avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-rich businessmen who are closely linked to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela comes from the US media, then you know nothing. He is not an "unelected tyrant" and does not "reign by decree" - he is hugely popular, having been elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of the votes (something that George Bush Junior has never achieved) and devotion inspires in the Venezuelan ordinary people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The ability of the directors lies in being discreet and letting the story unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at all levels, from the barrio to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and the confusion from which a coherent whole emerges that is tense, compelling and moving. Not to be missed!
