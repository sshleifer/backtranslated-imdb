When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was the typical "love your neighbor" stuff ... The more the film went on, the more I got involved. Acting is magnificent by both actors, the direction was great, the story unusual. My eyes got tired, the first time in my life for a movie. A real must in any serious video library. 11 out of 10
