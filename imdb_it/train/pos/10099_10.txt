The anime that made me passionate about souls ... <br /> <br /> Set in the year 2010 (hey, it's not too far now!) The Earth is now a poisonous gas, desert of pollution and violence. Since the crimes are happening every 30 seconds are like this and were committed by thieves who have the firepower of third world terrorists, the fictitious New Port City government forms the tank police to address the problem: policemen with carts armed! Oh, madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a red-haired Japanese woman (yes, I know, they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has he has just been drafted into the tank police and soon joined forces with a blond and blue-eyed boy. Leona is new in the use of tanks and unfortunately destroys the tank tank of the commander of the tank police Charles Britain (also known as "Brenten"), a guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and wears a pair of glasses elegant suns, a great revolver and a bad temper Britain did not like Leona joining the Tank Police and first destroying her Tiger Special (a giant tank of green monsters) did not exactly fascinate her, nor the she would have liked to take the remains of her huge tank and used it to build a mini-tank that she nicknamed Bonaparte and that soon pushes her to have it transferred to the well-being of children "where the boys are older" as he says. There are also the specifications, the bifocal genius, the citation of the Bible / the God-fearing one, the false Moicano from the MO and the pot-bellied head, which is right at the limit thanks to the mayor who always shouts him about the antics of the tank police. Seen as the police of tanks often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and using extreme violence to capture them, they are not much appreciated by the people. <br /> <br /> The "bad guys" are a cyborg named Buaku who has a mysterious past connected to a project known as "Green Peace", his gang and his two sexy cyborg friends cat Anna and Uni Puma. In the first episode these guys are paid to steal urine samples from a hospital that treats people who have not been infected by clouds of poisonous gas and in the second they are hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku. The story, however, was not completed in the anime and ended in a cult comic ("Manga") which is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> All sorts of chaos and chaos trigger off in this black comic adventure that examines how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the thin line between good guys and bad starts to get confused. This is the kind of thing that if you had to make a movie about it, you'd better take Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but very fun. <br /> <br /> Followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".
