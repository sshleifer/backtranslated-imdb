I saw this movie when it was released when I was 17 and in the classic rock (I'm still) ... I never liked the opera before because I hate the voices of the soprano, but it changed all that. He was adorable in the film and had an extraordinary voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died at the home of pancreatic cancer tonight, he will be missed, and he certainly left his mark on this world. I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, watch and have fun. * smiles * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and take a look before it's sold out.
