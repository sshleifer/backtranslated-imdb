The writing word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not exactly! What makes the brave and ingenious "motto" of Madhur Bhandarkar is to destroy the myth of the glam and glitterati that color the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (read party habits) we follow with a maniacal fervor that only our intrinsic voyeuristic can explain. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is as regrettable as it is enigmatic. How exactly he got this control over the printed word and when he started invading the first page is the subject of another debate. Bhandarkar skillfully avoids it. He is interested only in the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing so, it brings together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (although I'm not comparing Bhandarkar with the genius of Altman), Bhandarkar uses a myriad of characters to promote his motive. Whether it is an aspiring NRI on page 3, the bad guys, the newly rich, an imminent model, a socialite politician or a writer of erotic stories; all the characters are presented with a target and each of them has a separate character sketch, even if their parts can be lowercase. And here is the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 of Nation Today. Initially satisfied with her work, she soon starts to see the ugliness of this weak point that is covered by her fake and cosmetic debauchery. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to turn this subject into a moral police film and avoids focusing on just one character. So the film is not just about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - the publisher of Madhavi who passively accepts his role as the gear of a larger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a socialite suffocated by social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual makeup artist and roommates of Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the unfortunate hostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) into a story, but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a very tight script. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good, can fall flat with a lack of authentic performance. Fortunately, 'Page 3' is full of actors and not stars. Konkona goes through its role supported by the author with effortless ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost exaggerates it. Atul Kulkarni, however, is wasted with a signed character. Sometimes, the director seems too inclined to incorporate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them seem hasty. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism, but it goes a step further. It takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the macabre reality of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to live in a different and remote world. These are the same people who indulged in the New Year's binge while a few hundred kilometers away their compatriots had been devastated by the ferocity of nature! Intelligent writing, cleverly incorporated songs, skilled performances and a sincere feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy despite its lack of subtlety and poor production value. 'Page 3' is an optimal way to enter a new year of cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Evaluation- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29th 2005
