This film brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the hearts of viewers, directing this wonderful image in which life is seen through Paulie's mind and heart. We discover from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I could not stop the tears, even if the film has a happy ending. This is fantastic, after thousands of movies I've seen in my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is, after the "Ugly Duckling", the second photo that really upset me.
