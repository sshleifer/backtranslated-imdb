"The Woman in Black" is easily one of the most disturbing British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to manage the estate of a dead client, is infested by a mysterious woman dressed in black. The film is loaded with an extremely disturbing atmosphere and the scares are calculated and provide the maximum possible effect. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the ending is quite disturbing. The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a really creepy horror movie give it a look. I dare anyone to watch "The woman in black" alone at night with the lights off. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
