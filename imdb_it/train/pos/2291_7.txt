Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" are that the crazy leporide of "A Wild Hare" now has a name, and that he utters his famous "Of course you understand that this means war!" for the first time. Mostly, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out exactly what to do with this long-eared rascal. It is certainly a must for fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake, it is quite funny what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible Elmer Fudd. Clear nuances of things to come abound throughout the cartoon. I advise.
