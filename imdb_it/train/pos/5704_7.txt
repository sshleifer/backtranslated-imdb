To be honest, I was expecting car chases in this movie. There was only one, but apart from that, 'Freeway' was a great movie that I'm happy to own on DVD. The only prominent names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and a b-movie villain par excellence like Billy Drago as Freeway Killer. But the rest of the cast generally gives good performances. I particularly liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, some courage. He could be a helpless victim but he is completely round as he searches for Dragon with the help of the bounty hunter James Russo. Russian, I'm afraid, looks rather like wood, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very well done, except for a retrospective story that Sunny gave to his former commander. The tone of the threat is superbly maintained throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely Los Angeles highway at night with the killer wandering along its length in its left gray sedan chair is a great way to create tension, the music used to underline the film is properly composed. I don't know why there are some people who hate this movie like that. Different traits for different people, I suppose. But I absolutely loved "Freeway" and can recommend it highly.
