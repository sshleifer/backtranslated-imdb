This must be a unique twist of two kinds of never before seen. The gigantic genre of monster movies with the genre of the living mummy movie. This unique blend makes a unique and compelling story. The casts are exceptional, including TOM BOSLEY who, as far as I know, has never been in a horror film before. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy full of smaller mummies is a nice idea. My only complaint, I only wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but others then that I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The acting was wonderful. This must be the best movie to get out of the science fiction channel. You heard me, the best movie out of the science fiction channel. I GIVE THE FALLEN ONES 9 SU 10.
