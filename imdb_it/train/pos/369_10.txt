Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times and I can't cross it without crying. I challenge anyone to watch the meeting of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and father and not feel your eyes become foggy. Whoopie Goldberg should have a prize for an extraordinary performance. And for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I am a testament to this.
