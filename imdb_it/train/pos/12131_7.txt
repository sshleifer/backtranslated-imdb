The film is concerned about Philip (Leslie Howard), he is a serious but handicapped medical student. He falls madly in love with a heartless and predator maid named Mildred (Bette Davis). He leaves it, involving others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile it is a love story with other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee) but returns to a destructive story. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and the first of several film versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis is the cruel cockney waitress who wins yet another magnificent performance with a seductive and steaming performance, absolutely hypnotic in her slavery story that occurs from beginning to end. Davis came to the fore with her performance The overbearing woman's role as hard and raw will be repeated several times in the acting of the posterior. Leslie Howard as the student, basically good and discreet, subtly destroyed, offers an excellent and melancholic performance. He was a fantastic actor (Gone with the Wind) as well as producer and writer and died in a plane crash during World War II. Both will play again in "Petrified Forest" (1936). The elaborately set film is recreated in the RKO studio (Radio Picture Inc) and is completely convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The film will appeal to lovers of classic cinema. Rating: Very good but a little dated.
