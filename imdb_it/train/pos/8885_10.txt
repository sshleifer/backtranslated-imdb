Sometimes you have to look back to move forward. The 1960s did just that. We must remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Great mix Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be named and win, the best mixer of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The best mini series of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks Ursula <br /> <br />
