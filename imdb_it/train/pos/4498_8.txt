Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so this isn't Anna Karenina, but it's a beautiful love story, very well written and well represented by everyone. Even some "loud laughter" moments mixed with some pretty serious observations about loyalty, prejudices about age and aging parents / Alzheimer's problems. <br /> <br /> Even the eccentric guitar music has been added to the story. <br /> <br /> While I was a fan of Ms. Annis' from 'Lillie' (in the 70s) and Mr. Kitchen's from 'The Buccaneers' and' Enchanted April ', I have only recently discovered Mr. Green ("Me and Mrs. Jones", "Touching the Evil", etc.), Ask me the question: why had I not seen "Reckless" until recently ?? !! Indeed more than a "chick" of something a man will sit on, it is perfect for the lazy vision of a rainy afternoon.
