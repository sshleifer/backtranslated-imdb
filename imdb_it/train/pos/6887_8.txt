This is a unique and daring film. He is energetic, with highly developed characters. Excellent performance. <br /> <br /> I love filmmakers who are not afraid to ask the public to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inside, ask questions and dig under the surface. Due to the nature of the film, it practically requires the viewer to look inside. It may take some courage to do so. I can see how some people with a careful mind might find this rather disturbing. However, I found it stimulating, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is really an original director, with a vision. I'm curious to see what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Watch it.
