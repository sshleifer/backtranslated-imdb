... and I love it. A lot of special effects, and for a film that is not made in mega budget, this film really does a great job in creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story, but this was still a great movie to watch. It's definitely up there in standards that exceed Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like Harry Potter. Which means a lot again for a film, made in a fraction of the budget of these international successes. <br /> <br /> One thing I love about this movie is that it extends the plot of the adventure film to come out of Hong Kong. The topic is exotic and original. The quality of production is different from anything seen coming out of HK for fantasy action movies, and acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> One of the best films released in Hong Kong, this is the fantasy film Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong and I hope they will continue to work in this area, until they pass the Hollywood adventure films. <br /> <br /> Simply fantastic.
