This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard that it would be rubbish, so I didn't expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I didn't take the main girl well and I didn't really care if she lived or died. After a while she grew up with me and became a nice character. It's not just a movie where people die for no reason. There is a background story that takes only a few seconds of the movie, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure if you look at it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. You will still be living for 80 years.
