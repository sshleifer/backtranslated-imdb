This isn't exactly a great movie, but I admire writers and directors for trying something different. The main theme of the film is destiny and the small, seemingly insignificant things that can significantly change the future. Somehow this reminds me of the movie SLIDING DOORS, although instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random things happen repeatedly and each one helps to build the cute conclusion. Furthermore, a strange bald guy seems to understand all this and talks about it during a brief scene - as if he were some kind of being omnipotent but there is absolutely no explanation for him in the movie (like the two boys fighting clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The DVD cover shows only Audrey Tautou. This is capitalizing on his success in AMELIE, even if she is just one of the many actors in the film and there is no leading role. The rhythm is lively, the fine of the acting and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I didn't get a higher score is that some of the characters were a little uninteresting and I think the film could perhaps have been strengthened with some fewer subplots.
