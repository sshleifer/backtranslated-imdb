Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although it hasn't been released for years afterwards), this is worth it. De Niro's role is not huge, but fun as one of the two friends who first try to prevent another friend from getting married just to pursue him to force him to do so. Any De Niro fan will soon die with an anticipated performance, probably the best actor today.
