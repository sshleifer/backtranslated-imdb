I saw this film when I was 13 and I really liked Dana Plato, who later starred in different hits like Kimberly Drummond. I don't think it's rubbish. Not even this was meant to be a sequel to the documentary. it's just a movie for cute kids about 3 kids looking for a swampy monster. men get hurt and children save them with the help of the creature. shots of the marsh and the Arkansas scenery have been ordered. this is a good movie for children, no real violence, some slight fear but good fun for small children.
