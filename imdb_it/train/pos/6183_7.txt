Financially funded Paramount beat all the stops for this adaptation phase to the '34 farewell: big budget, great cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as a director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a mysterious murder script that didn't deserve to be in the same dustbin as Charlie Chan's worst first draft down the street. I have to believe that the cut has come out of Leisen's hands since the great Duke Ellington issue is brutally broken up, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a look: the issue of "Sweet Marihuana" with topless girls is a blower mind, considering the looming production code and also has the charming Toby Wing (who unfortunately sported horrible jokes and interpreting the prototype of stupid blonde) as a hot chorister for an otherwise worried Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's acting is as bland as Melba Toast but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches new plateaus like stereotypical stupid detective. And try to spot Lucy in the choir. This rate 7.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 rethink: I recently gave the film another look and now I feel I was wrong to blame the lack of production numbers for Busby Berkeley. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers in the context of the plot. I still have huge problems with editing. Paramount, the largest studio in the city, faced enormous problems with the Production Code at the worst possible moment in its history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this (it also controls the 1934 beauty quest). A must see for pre-code enthusiasts.
