A long film about a very important South African character, Stephen Biko. It is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid, who died long before their normal time. The old film, however, does not show how important Biko was, what it really represented. His life and his teaching are reduced to a few, at most some spiritual commentary. Being the 1987 film, the goal was to push South Africa beyond the brink that would take it to liberation. The film aims to show how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are in 1987. To show this, the film must look beyond Biko's death, then center his speech not on Biko but on a liberal white journalist and his escape from the absurd system in which he lives. His escape is necessitated by the victimization he is victim to, along with his family, and by the fact that he wants to publish the first book on Biko, after his death, and that it can only take place in England. The film shows a way to escape from South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So don't expect this to be realistic and true. It couldn't be. But the film has tremendously aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical distinction, the distance that occurred under the presidency of Nelson Mandela and which is called forgiveness provided that those who want to be forgiven speak openly. The film is strong and exciting, but that historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially because the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books or films all have that flaw: they look at the person they should portray from a single point of view. This explains why the film has aged so much, it seems to have come from a long time ago, as if nothing had changed at all. A remake is necessary. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
