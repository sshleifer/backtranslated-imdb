Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It is raw, painful and realistic but very fun. Leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will become Oscar-winning actors, offer incredible performances. Voight as the Texas bully, Joe Buck, who migrates from the small town of Texas to New York to become a hustler. He does not apologize for his chosen profession, but it is not so easy. The women of New York City, like the wealthy lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass, played by Oscar-nominated Sylvia Miles, are different from women in Texas. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died in 1969 from cancer. The locations in New York are wonderful to see, as the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck's characters evolves into a moving friendship from man to man. Men are struggling to survive in New York life by not respecting the rules how to get a real job. As the film evolves, Buck's past comes to the surface and is disturbing but unclear. The film is not for children, but compared to today's movies and TV shows, Midnight Cowboy could be more gentle. I can't forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party you can't forget. It's also a tear-jerker from a movie, so take your handkerchiefs too.
