I saw The Perfect Son about three times. I can't see how this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I don't see it as a gay movie. It's a movie with a gay character, I can't understand why every movie with a gay character should be strictly a movie about being gay. I find that the film is in tune with the study of death, the death of someone who is your relative. I think Theo turns his life pretty fast after rehabilitation because he wants and watching his brother die in front of him makes him see his life again. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will be a very moving father, Ryan says he doesn't want to know anything about what he won't see or share with anyone. Isn't it so horrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
