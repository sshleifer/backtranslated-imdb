This film is definitely a strange love story. Although this film may not be much to scream, Nicole Kidman brings the film alone the rest of the cast could easily be forgotten, although Ben Chaplin does a good job of Hertfordshire Life with shots of St Albans and Hemel Hempstead city center depicting true essence of the area. What begins as a normal episode of the famous British television series "Heartbeat" soon turns into an action movie for gangster escape. Nothing memorable happens in this simple small movie and ends as well as discreet weekend entertainment. A good one to look at, and if you like the hero John you're only thirty something you might find something to identify with in his character.
