Overall, I have to say I liked the film. Some fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really annoyed me is the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I really mean. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise, Sammo perfectly copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves. 5 stars out of 10.
