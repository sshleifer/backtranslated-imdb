The band of roses. "Every Rose Has Its Thorns". <br /> <br /> A mix of old western and hip hop, perfectly harmonized. The styles of clothing, the scenery and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - in five years, they have robbed twenty-seven banks and then vanished without a trace. Now, a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it's personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five gunslingers who share after five years of riding together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends up rallying her friends again and riding on a trail of revenge. <br /> <br /> A good version of the western. (If you've seen Bad Girls, well, that's a little better in the ways of female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, the plot and the scenery made it for me.
