I keep watching this movie again and again and again. I have to see it at least once a week. I come from Africa and watching that movie taught me some things that I didn't even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for people who walk with life. I wish he were my brother. I also saw and loved your Masala Mississipi. What an electrifying situation. When Denzel was trying to hook his brother to work, he reminds me of my teenage years when my brother was always mad at me for finding me busy all the time. My brother always took care of my father and he also wants to see me the same way. By the way, where did Denzel get that African accent from the movie Cry Freedom? I first saw that film in Africa and I didn't know Denzel was an American until I moved here.
