Having just seen the mini-series A Perfect Spy at one time, all you can do is steal your hat: a pure masterpiece, which compared to the other mini notes of Le Carré on Smile, has quite different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the Smiley movie, it's Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors support it, one can say. <br /> <br /> Here ensemble and history are important, as the main actor, played very well by Peter Egan in the final episodes, is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan simply plays a guy named Magnus Pym, who lying, being sneaky and telling people what he likes to hear, is very much appreciated by everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech manager. <br /> <br /> Never having the machine behind a spy, and / or a traitor, has been better said! After following his life from an early age, we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and pretend everything is what makes him "a perfect spy", as his Czech coach calls him. <br /> <br /> And, following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to return to the straight path once the limit is exceeded. He goes around, even if he doesn't get anything cheap, except for the promotion of his MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy, as long as the flow of counterfeit information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a bad scammer, who always dreams of plans to exclude his own money. In the following years, his son must save him again and again. But with the example of his father and uncle, who takes the place of guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mother is sent to an asylum, Magnus soon learns that lying is the way to survive, without telling the truth. At first he tears it up a bit, but quickly learns to tell the right lies and be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that tells those who want to listen to themselves and their father. <br /> <br /> His Czech handler Alex, skilfully interpreted by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existent informants, which provides British MI5 with false information for years and years, just like the Englishmen did with German Spies who were active in the UK before and during the war - they continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents had been transformed, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> young people playing Magnus in the younger ones do it wonderfully, and many of them are more charismatic than Pym, the oldest, cynical and tired, played by Egan. But you can easily buy the difference, as it is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to sadness, or indifference. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's really worth it!
