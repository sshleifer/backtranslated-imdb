This is one of those unique horror films that require a much more mature understanding of the word "horror" in order to be appreciated. The main thing is that people cannot understand that this story is told from a child's point of view and, like most young children, it is easily frightened. Mainly because he simply doesn't understand things, like because his father is almost never there for him. From watching the movie you can see her husband discussing the balance between working time and family time with his wife and you can easily understand it, but the boy doesn't. Furthermore, one can imagine that the boy is afraid of the woods, as was established at the beginning of the film, that the family is originally from the city. Moreover, at the beginning, while the family travels to the house, it strikes a deer, then is restrained, then discusses with the locals and the boy certainly does not find this introduction to the woods at all pleasant. <br /> <br /> The "Wendigo" is ultimately what its young innocent mind factory to explain all this. There is the American Indian legend, but when you look at the scene where the young boy talks about it, he is explained in a frank and simplistic way. Not because this is what Wendigo really is, but because that's how he understands it. When you watch the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it. Obviously it was low-budget and cheap, but the hopping mounts, the use of light and the general strangeness rather than compensate. And the last question the film asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: bad words, violence and sex scenes
