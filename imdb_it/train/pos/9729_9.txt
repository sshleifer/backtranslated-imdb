Start weak, medium solid, fantastic ending. This is my impression of this film, however. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I saw in --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. He shows his range as an actor, but I didn't really like the character as he was portrayed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor I call "comedy of frustration". His alleged "jokes" and spirit are nothing but painful and embarrassing moments. Very similar to the character of Bean Rowan Atkinmson. There are a number of other comic actors who also portray similar characters. I don't intend to beat them here, so I won't. <br /> <br /> But I warn you that if you are like me, and you don't like thin and incredibly messy idiots, Pegg just shows these characteristics for the first third of this movie. It's better, though. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Could be. The story of the film stopped being annoying, and became a sort of triumph of the "little boy" in the third final. I don't need all the films to be sugary and light --- but by coincidence, as this film has improved, it has also started to be more and more a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play such a masterly role. I liked "Iron Man", but I was saddened by the fact that the character of Bridges was a villain. Purely personal taste, of course, since his acting was exceptional. Nonetheless, it was a wonder here as the businessman of Bigger Than Life, the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could really enjoy. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked it! I just hope I arrived 40 minutes late and lost the start.
