I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a movie like when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Brown in my left foot. In fact, his role was not yet finished off stage. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him during all the filming of the film and needed surgery due to the damage his superior acting had done to him. For me it is extraordinary and through all the pain he has endured to play that role I think it is quite true to say that he has staged most of the Oscars worthy of the story. He was so masterful in this tough part that I think no one could have done better or with more of an impact than him. Although I can't say it's the greatest film of all time, I can say that he played this impossible role and then continued acting until he was no longer the greatest foot I've ever seen an actor do. Probably also a man for that matter.
