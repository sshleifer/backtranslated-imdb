I'm sure this is a show no one is so familiar with and might not think well; after all it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the location, the style of the director and his advertising ?? shows the women walking on the beach and everything else. No wonder people have misconceptions and decide not to look at them. <br /> <br /> It was wrong of them to do so. Because after deciding to watch the show, there are actually more things going on, a real juicy story and a conflict, turn out to be really exciting to watch and practically ?? compelling. <br /> <br /> The story of the hotel employees, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the annoying hotel visitor and the powerful man who tries to steal the hotel. It is actually more exciting than it seems here. <br /> <br /> I won't deny that acting is disgusting, but it's not so bad that you look away. The story is not so consistent, but quite good. The soundtrack adapts quite well to the scenario and the action is always. It took me a couple of episodes before something solid happened, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really like watching it. Zillion Times Better Better Expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Rating: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review after reading it, thank you.
