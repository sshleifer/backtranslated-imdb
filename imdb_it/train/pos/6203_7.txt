An extraordinarily bizarre film with enough twists for a lot of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable and affectionate mother who may or may not be what she seems. The story is very ironic and the dialogue is wisely underestimated. Hints of humor and intrigue, neither of them has the better of Posey's characterization. The supporting cast is stellar. The other side of the coin? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal when raising an eyebrow than most actresses all over the body. Worth your time, even if you don't understand the epilogue.
