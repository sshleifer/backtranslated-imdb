This is one of the best movies. It's one of my favorites A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Also good work with the camera. <br /> <br /> The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the list of American stars. However, they give equal or better performance than the top of the list. <br /> <br /> It is a real pleasure to see a film about true love, romance and friendship without having to bear the vision of someone who has to kick-box their way of saving the world. <br /> <br /> If you don't like this movie, then you have no heart or feelings. Then go watch a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. Watch the film. It is a must. TH
