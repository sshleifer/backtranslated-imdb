I was forced to see it because a) I have an 11-year-old girl and b) we showed her the films of Bonita Granville from the 1930s, which she greatly appreciated. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the action movies of the 1930s, but on the other hand, I didn't fear it would be the sickening piece of intelligence and insult. It was a harmless, slightly funny film. Although I'm glad they didn't try to "update" Nancy to "hipness" in the 21st century (Veronica Mars holds the title of Modern Nancy Drew), I think they made her a little too bland, that she didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the film could have been titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with the one they had to work with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a TV version, not a theatrical version, a script ...
