This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching love story with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and consequences of life for every unfortunate individual lacking this vital ability. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who knows a commissioner in her factory work, an illiterate canteen employee named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read and, after losing her job, gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as might be expected, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for one another ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays Iris, a woman with problems, competently propri, facing a job with no prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and an abusive husband. However, Robert De Niro is obviously brilliant in his captivating portrait of Stanley, intelligent and resourceful but illiterate, which gives dignity to the role that commands respect. I'm not the typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in screen novels, but a normal working class, a middle-aged couple with a nice down-to-earth fight. <br /> <br /> I will not give the final away, but it is an adorable, moving love story and a personal aspect in the worrying problem of adult illiteracy, even if from the point of view of an imaginary character.
