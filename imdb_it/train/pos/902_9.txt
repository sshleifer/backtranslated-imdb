I thought this movie was really great because, in India, nowadays, everything you see is skin, music and bad acting ... in this movie, you can see a little bit of tradition, ethnicity and at least a little bit of decency ... even if some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? this is what Indian cinema is! after watching this movie, at least you don't get a headache from all the oversized music, or from any violence, it's just the truth, teaches love and, of course, take care of the person you love all your life ... I think that it was a fantastic film ... Children can see it no doubt, and adults will appreciate the simplicity that in the past was the undoubted depth of India ... until all these rap shots, miniskirts and skin shows became part of it.
