I didn't know what to expect from "Ned Kelly", but I loved it. It was dark, dramatic and compelling. I also felt very authentic, I felt I was transported back to the 1800s. I was never a fan of Heath Ledger, I had only seen him in children's movies, but he is quite addictive in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a very lively boy has become Australia's most famous murderer. Naomi Watts is big in a supporting role as a lover of Kelly's society. Highly recommended - and this is from an Australian!
