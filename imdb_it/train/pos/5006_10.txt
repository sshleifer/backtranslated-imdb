I remember stumbling upon this special while sailing in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra before. When the show is over, I thought "This is probably the best thing on TV that I will ever see in my life". 42 years later, this is true. There is still nothing so surprising, as honestly surprising as the talent that was shown here. You can talk about all the super-stars you want, this is the most superlative of all! <br /> <br /> You can name him, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sensual seduction, ballads, Barbra is really a storyteller. His ability to bring out everything he tries is legendary. But this special was created in the beginning and helped create the legend that quickly became. Despite rising so quickly, he fulfilled his promise, revealing more of his talents as he went along. But they are all here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed to see this.
