I was a fan of the book since the third grade, so obviously I had seen the movie, read the sequel and then watched the TV show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult I still like the show. My only real problem was that he didn't follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from a girl who has a first addition of the book. But after a while I decided to give it a try again and ignored the book (kind of like what you have to do with the Harry Potter movies). I found the wonderful series! It was clean and something that everyone could enjoy, the right amount comedy to keep everyone going. It's really fun! Clean and wonderful!
