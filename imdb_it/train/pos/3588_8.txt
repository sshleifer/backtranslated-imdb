When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters. I've seen a lot of rape movies, but this one stands out. This film has a kind of realism that is very rare to find in today's movies, not to mention TV movies. He tells a story that I'm sure is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today, and I found it very credible (which is something difficult to find in other rape-centered films). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were fantastic in the parts they played. I highly recommend this film to all those who love movies that have a bit of a hard reality for them. I loved it.
