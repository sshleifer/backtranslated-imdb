for anyone who plays video games here someone has noticed that GTA: Vice City Mansion within the game and some other things including the movie's weapons that are related to this movie and this movie inspired the creators of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this movie and the way this is one of the best 80 movies out there I recommend it to all those who haven't seen it yet. 10/10 no question
