For the first three seasons Sabrina was a hidden gem on the TGIF (and later, the first afternoon replies from the school). Each episode had a maniac, a crazy energy and a rapid pace of fire that surpassed every occasional embarrassing joke. Melissa Joan Hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. His two aunts, who played "straight men" or straight as two witches, had great comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, like a talking cat, was free to delight in whatever crazy scheme he was interested in, and he could laugh and take it all fast because he was, after all, a talking cat. Sabrina's friends completed the social experience at school, in which they also found the typical "evil cheerleaders" and "totalitarian principal". Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture (eg. Band of the time, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition / morality (for example, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) and the literal representation of these related metaphors in the Magic Kingdom. Unfortunately, like so many other shows during the television age, the show reached its peak during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina attending high school. Starting in the fourth season, the transition to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the overall quality of the show, particularly when writers chose to present Josh as Harvey's rival and inventing subtle excuses for Aunt Hilda and Zelda to stay on the screen as key players. The last season, in which Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was unmistakably disappointing. And yet, in the end, Sabrina (in particular the high school years) remains a unique voice as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it above the annoying tariff produced every year in this genre.
