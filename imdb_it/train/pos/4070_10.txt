I know Anime. It took a long time before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about mine, let me say this: of all the spirits I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It is obvious that people say that Spirited Away is the best, but I do not agree at all. Most people know that movie just because it's an Acedmy award; this is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who have always seen Spirited Away, and I agree that the last two are the superiors of the three. Personally, I never thought anything could be compared to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily equal; in many ways, Castle has important elements that Mononoke lacked. In both cases, if you only saw Spirited Away and think that this is the best film by Miyazaki, prepare to make your land tremble.
