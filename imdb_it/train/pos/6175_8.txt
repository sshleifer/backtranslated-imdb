I saw this pilot when it was first shown, and I'm sure countless "Spirit" fans hate him, because, like Batman, the Green Hornet etc., he took the character in the "field" direction. But evidently I can't get enough of Batman, because I thought it was funny, in some of the same ways as that show. There are two parts that remain with me. First, when Denny's partner was mortally wounded, and delivered a dramatic speech about how he always sided with the law, and obeying his exact letter. Then, he says something like "Boy, I was stupid!" What is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (albeit the Batman genre on TV). Then, there is the scene in which he tries to seduce the villain to let him go kissing her, but she is not deceived, because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a great example of "field", which was also "undervalued", both as an actor and as an actress.
