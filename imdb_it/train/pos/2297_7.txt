There is something in every "Hammer" movie that I see that really brings me to a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those types of movies. Venture deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different kind of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable film. 7.5 / 10.
