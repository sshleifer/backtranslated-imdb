Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems like an imprimatur for first-rate cinema. This is the best performance I've ever had. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they are. There are no good guys and not bad. But the system has its inexorable effect on people who think they handle it. Not only is Pacino's performance irresistible --- the eulogy at the funeral of the deceased is incredibly powerful --- the film has a gritty and fast realism that enhances the beautiful performances without resorting to tricks. This exceptional portrait of the politics of the big city also manages to provide two hours of superb films that watch without excessive violence, overheated sex or bad language. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my tired faith in Hollywood. I don't press many tens. This fully deserves it!
