In an attempt to establish public empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) the filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawker. Missouri never retired from the Union and the Union Army was not an invasion force. The Southerners fought for the rights of the state: the right to possess slaves, elect corrupt legislations and judges and employ a system of political booty. There is nothing noble about this. The Missouri family could easily have traveled east and enlisted in the Confederate army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that history has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, it is not because he saw the error on his way, he certainly does not let himself go to the virtue of the cause of abolition.
