Yes, this film is predictable and certainly not a prize. But then it doesn't try to be something it isn't. A fun filled with fun funny one-liners, a stellar and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole, a floor and floor performance by Joan Plowright. The band's performance was in place, each one playing their role in a clever and comical way. The music was good, though not exceptional, but it completed the film well. From some negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of a bit of humor went beyond their heads. A good example is the comment on the "weird baseball game", well, my dear American, which was the cricket - from which baseball comes - and the explanation of this to the ignorant US band was a lot of fun for those who know about cricket. Also no, you didn't have to tremble when Carl broke a window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" to get more money for the break and the manager said at the same time "oh no" even referring to the money. Gee, it seems that every joke needs to be explained to some people ... Overall I had fun and had a good laugh! Worth seeing.
