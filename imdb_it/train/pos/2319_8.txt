<br /> <br /> It's a generic training story - think "The Marriage Member", "Summer of '42", "A Summer Place", even "Little Women" - and there are times when Mulligan could having omitted the soup music, not used in slow motion, or minimized the golden beauty of the environment. Otherwise, it is done with a rare perfect emotional tone. Nothing is forced, every line has feeling and the rhythm is right. Even the sub-A-list casting helps: bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities may have overwhelmed the material. In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: his lines are fresh and original, and his body language is perfect for a clumsy and anxious 14-year-old on the eve of femininity. Waterston is also very beautiful, even though he has to spend most of the film climbing in and out of the family truck. <br /> <br /> It is understood that the film's producers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects - no big stars, no car accidents, no special effects - and consciously decided to make the best film possible, the box office be damned. It is intimate and honest and sticks to the ribs. If you find yourself tarnishing at the end, you don't have to feel cheated.
