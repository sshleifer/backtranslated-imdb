I saw it at "Dances with Films" and it was great. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only are your parents divorced, but there is a monster after you. <br /> <br /> It was both felt and scary - there were several moments when the audience screamed in a real scare. It reminded me of a Japanese horror film, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that's what separates "Jake's Closet" from the usual indy pabulum movie - an excellent script with compelling characters. Furthermore, mixing elements of the horror film with the family drama, the film gets the best of both genres, and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't come out in theaters, you definitely get the DVD.
