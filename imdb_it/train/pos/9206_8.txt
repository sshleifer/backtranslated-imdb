We don't come across films about the brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects that have not been exploited in films or novels. Generally, a sister is depicted as a pile-on that can be used for ransom in the climax. This film is about the subject in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by the George Eliot novel "The Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, good, the blue-eyed boy who is a good son conventionally and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and rebellious from the unwritten rules of society. Despite this, the love for sister-sister is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film is about the love of two brothers who separate in childhood and the rebirth of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the search for the submissive brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be savage to challenge the world. <br /> <br /> Even if the film and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, however the feelings are the same and still apply.
