I never bothered to see this movie in theaters, even though I remember hearing the name over and over again. I finally saw it this week and what a joy. For some reason, I expected it to not go very well, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and got stuck and then found myself completely pulled back inside. I read many other comments from users and it impressed me how many people talk about her fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that she is a real fighter in life. All she has to do is find her place where she is who she is and the ring helps her get there. A very clever story and I'm amazed that this is the first time for Michelle Rodriguez - what an excellent job she did. Adrian and his coach were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit rough, but it doesn't matter. The story, the will and the performances completely overcome any defect (which usually comes however with the independent cinema). A compelling portrait of a girl who finds herself and triumphs over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
