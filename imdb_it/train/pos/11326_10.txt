I've seen the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I'm not interested in a series of Neon Genesis Evangelion anime. This series is actually based on a h-game, which I'm not sure whether it was done before or not, I didn't play the game, but from what I heard it follows it very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series a 10/10. It has a nice story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've seen. There is also fantastic Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this series yet, take a look. You can find episodes with subtitles on some anime websites out there, it came directly from Japan.
