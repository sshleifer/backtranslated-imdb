10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks with a reduced budget by writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small film shot in Carson, California that seems to have been improvised ... in the true sense of the word . Silberling was fortunate enough to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, among his great projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different points of view who manage to improve the life of the other. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself, yet part of the play is that he is portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years, exploring a place for a bit of "fill film" to return to flow of things. His "role" is that of a market manager and is left to Carson's squalid market where he meets, among others, a Scarlet, the girl on the line of argument of 10 objects or less. Scarlet is not only tired of her static work, she is also generally angry with her unfaithful husband (Bobby Cannavale), who is currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy collaborator (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The double pair after some shared problems and away in a "journey" that leads each of the characters to grow from the presence and history of the other's life. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply said, but because of the tender bond between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships in which being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It's worth seeing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative and comical - a pleasure to see. Grady Harp
