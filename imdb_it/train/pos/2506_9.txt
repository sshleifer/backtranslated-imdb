Moon Child was one of the most symbolic films I've seen. What I really liked is the illustration of immorality / mortality and obstacles and guides in life. The film describes a great deal of Kei vampire who has the power of immorality and the advantages to it. Whether it's supernatural abilities or eternal life, these are what humans usually want. Moon Child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, since feelings about loss affect almost all the characters, particularly the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "Moon Child" reveals that the film is approaching the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that illuminates the way of other people, giving a guide. Personality quite similar to the moral one described in the film. The weaknesses of the film lie in some parts of the acting and special effects as they make the film less authentic. The scene in which the character of Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions had been put into it. Some scenes with special effects such as gun shots could also be more authentic without making an action video game seem too much. The sparks coming out of the guns looked too fake and I think they could have been eliminated or repaired. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider watching. The ideas and symbolic images that the film highlights would easily be accepted by all and could interest many viewers. It's a rather thoughtful film and also fun to watch.
