************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie and this is because I have a big crush on Richard Belzer. I don't know much about humor) There were some parts that were fun like Barbie and Ken Spoof, the dealers and the president's script. Mind you this is sometimes vulgar (Dare, I say raw?) Sometimes it was fun, but it could have been better. Probably if they spent more time in humor and less time undressing women, the film would have been more fun. Some scenes make you want to vomit and shiver, other scenes make you laugh and strangely think. Unfortunately this film is dated. If you have a crush on Richard Belzer (it's worth it) it's worth a try and see chevy chase.
