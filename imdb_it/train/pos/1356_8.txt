I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes you is the refreshing format, which although similar to many other reality shows in the middle, is still a lot of fun. Donald Trump is wonderful as a guest and also the main judge of the show. The twist with smart people who look good as a competitor is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of crap in his day, but his film management is excellent, as it makes NYC a character in its own right. Jazz melodies combined with some fantastic photographic works make New York look spectacular. <br /> <br /> The Apprentice will easily make my 3 best reality shows of all time (The Amazing Race is number 1, anyway). But just like in the extraordinary race, this show is always watched with the utmost moderation. If you continue to watch it for a while, the originality of the show will quickly run out (the same as in the TAR). Star World, the broadcasters of this country, made a bang by presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, then after two years the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. However, if you continue to watch the show continuously, from that moment on, its charm will be exhausted and FAST.
