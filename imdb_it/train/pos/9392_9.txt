I came home late one night and turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarize their choices for the week. I didn't hear anything about "Red Rock West" except two thumbs up and see it before it went away. He wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said he deserved better. <br /> <br /> The following afternoon, I followed their advice. They were right, it was one of the most fun I've ever had at the cinema. As some readers point out, there are some holes in the plot and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's worth it, for the refined craftsmanship that went into the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost all of them seem perfectly expressed. Dennis Hopper goes almost over the top, which gets silly but reinforces the way everything else works. Sets and music contribute a great deal to almost any scene. <br /> <br /> When I rented it later for my family, it didn't work as well. The long scenes that built the tension in the theater were hard to appreciate, with distractions at home. It deserves all your attention; Turn off the phone, make sure you are not disturbed, watch and listen to every scene, especially at the beginning.
