For quite a long time in my life, I didn't like this movie, or I liked this movie, but not like many others. I watched it recently (during a sleepover, strangely enough) and I liked it more than I did since I was less than 6 years old or something like that. Now I appreciate it more, as I do with some other Disney classics I've seen recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or whatever you write). <br /> <br /> Now I really appreciate the animation, the brilliant turns of the "Disney" plot, the humor of the mice, the expressed emotions and the plot. The animation is very well done, often you seem to be everywhere the other characters, watching them. Even the animation reproduces well the styles of the backgrounds, including the city (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting intelligent plot twists like mice that make clothes and the key part (I don't usually like Disney movies if they are not so similar to the original story but with this I'm not overly concerned, I feel that they have made the necessary changes to make this a good Disney movie, I often don't think Disney has changed the book in a good way in some of their films. <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her hideous stepmother and stepsister. She goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you watch it with friends (and the closest family if you want. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who love Disney at least a little bit, to people who love fairy tales and to people who like mice. To enjoy! :-)
