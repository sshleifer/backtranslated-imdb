MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED at a print screening and it was hilarious. We are talking about non-stop laughter. It makes SOMETHING OF MARY seem like a meandering drama. Amanda Peet shouts quality star with its winning combination of beauty, brain and acting skills. Peter Cohen, the director, has made an avant-garde film that shows the raw within the male ego in the world of urban dating. Throughout his comedy, Whipped succeeds with his intelligence. Which is so rare for a first time director, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber complete the cast with deep and very strong performances like the lady's men. You have to see these guys go to work and get caught up in the Peet network. Watch the trailer on whipped.com, worth the 3 minute download.
