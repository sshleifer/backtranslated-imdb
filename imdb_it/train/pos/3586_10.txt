I saw it for the first time when it was previewed more than ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. She Fought Alone is about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who loves injured girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school group, but when she reveals herself to be raped, the clique turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of Caitlin's struggle against an entire city, including a high school that essentially allows athletes to determine the social environment, allowing them to get by with what they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best artists, and there's a real chemistry between the two of them during the entire movie. All the actors in this film, which was inspired by real events, did a great job. He fought alone really captures the essence of what it's like to be in high school (at least in 1995), and have his self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10/10
