I tuned in to the independent film channel and I was riveted. I'm a professional actor and I was amazed by the performances. They felt totally improvised, absolutely without affectation. I can't tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and I waited until the end to see the credits and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the writer-director has also made a very nice film called Everyday People that I really enjoyed. The shame of the film business is that the projects of this excellent do not get the distribution and publicity they deserve and live under the radar. This film deserves to be flown high and proud. I urge people to look for it and watch it.
