It seemed that the year 1984 was everything but the Orwellian nightmare that had been calculated for George Orwell's science fiction novel !! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest moments in American history !! The upsurge of the economy and the re-emergence of fundamental American values ​​have cultivated an idealistic aura of innocence recovered, considered by the American people with a very favorable disposition !! There have been many surrogate representations of classic films in the past, but the originals are almost always considered superior !! "Purple Rain" is a film of this category !! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a soundtrack from the eighties, "happy-go-lucky" quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film !! Some artifacts indicative of the eighties are really classics !! Screwball comedies, neon clothes and of course the music !! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history !! Located in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" has hosted the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a child, I had lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, then the non-white population was under 3% !! In 1984, African Americans had made some roads on Minneapolis and, thus, they also established a well-established culture! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes eighties-style clothing and a music ensemble that effortlessly captivated the film's audience !! I loved the music of "Purple Rain" and, the innovative approach that this film brings to conflictual success, is really fantastic !! Watch this movie if you haven't seen it before !! Prince has become an icon of the eighties with this masterpiece !! For a short time, he goes out with Kim Bassinger, he has to do something right !! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map !! This film gets my emphatic assertive verdict of THUMBS UP !!!!
