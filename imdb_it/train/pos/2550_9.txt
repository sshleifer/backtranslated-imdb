This is really one of Hollywood's "Golden Ages", the kind they don't make anymore. It's a unique and fun movie that makes you understand what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly expressed and they are all great supporting actors. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman and since then I have been a fan of his. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite of mine and has added a certain quality to all the films in which he is. While playing a different character here, he still added something to the movie that another actor would not have had in this added character.
