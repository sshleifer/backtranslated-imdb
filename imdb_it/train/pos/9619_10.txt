OK so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask? ... well, you see this and maybe it will make more sense .. Hitchcock has never fused the scenes better together ... The film intertwines the scenes together impeccably from the beginning and yet you don't get that sparse feeling that sometimes gets gets when a movie guides you through the many characters it tries to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about them and then they won't let you down when they do. The surreal script of the screenwriter / producer Phil Hay, combined with an absolutely superb soundtrack, makes you think more of the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie with the same title ... I will look for more positive things from this producer in the future.
