I love this movie !!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and had my heart since I can remember. Prince is so close in this film. Last night I went to a special show at Purple Rain and it was like a concert that I was pleased to see real fans, because this film is so undervalued, it's really one of the greatest films of all time. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the most exciting act in the city and his eyes are on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color, I can thank "The Kid" for this. So if you haven't seen this, then you need to do it as soon as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
