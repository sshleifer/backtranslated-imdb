In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild seeks revenge. He marries Hagen and, through a series of events, eventually engages in a drastic (but appropriate) action at the end. <br /> <br /> One of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can watch certain performances. Attila the Hun (called Etzel in the film) is depicted as the strange person from the east, perhaps an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what the Fuhrer liked about the story. Nevertheless, this is an absolutely formidable film.
