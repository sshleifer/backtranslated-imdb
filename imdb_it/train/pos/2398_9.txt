I really enjoyed this movie. It took a rather obscure story - that of Shakespeare's Macbeth - and we wrapped it in a modern, extravagant, often fun and touching yarn. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the way the director brought the very different worlds of modern New York and Macbeth's Scotland together under one roof. The opposing worlds act to <br /> <br /> really to bring out the intrigue and comedy of the comedy and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the Choir, a part that does not exist in the game but really helps the things of jazz on. The finish stands out among the small indies that I saw for its closure and originality.
