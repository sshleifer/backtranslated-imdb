Hrm - I think the joke came from old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film that seems to have been translated from a language that was totally unknown to the translator. Here's a hint: any movie that starts with a black screen and the text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have kids climbing giant robots and ducts out to determine, well, this is never terribly clear , but it's probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists, that is "we") and bad guys (Commies!) And there are big stop-motion robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effects budget was quite small, so we don't. You can see many of the big robots. There are a lot of internal economic-looking scenes, and then a great space fight towards the end. Spatial fighting is particularly beautiful, since nothing more is needed than the shot for the rest of the effects budget. <br /> <br /> With the money spent now, the climate struggle degenerates into (and I'm not doing this about) two guys hit each other with sticks. I always manage to laugh in a bar recalling the final scene, with a final remark that guarantees to leave the audience scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
