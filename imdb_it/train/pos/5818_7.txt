Actually this film has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the part of Joe Pesci and the children, and it's much worse than other MJ films like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But as a huge Michael Jackson fan for almost eleven years, (Yes, it's half my life, guys!), I can't complain too much about that. Just seeing this adorable boy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a film, it is not at all beautiful, and I fear, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my dear Mike had not been the protagonist. But since no one but Mike is the moonwalker, he has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.
