I liked it very much even though reading the reviews was quite disturbing to me ... but as a fan of artistic animation I can perfectly understand this perfect work of art even though some were against my cultures and believe ... but hey , it's the art world .. !! the beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the contents that make me respect those who did. Only someone who is extremely open can make such a daring film. It is absolutely not for children ... even if the characters are cute and adorable but go through disturbing adventures that cannot be erased (sorry if the spelling is wrong) from memory ..
