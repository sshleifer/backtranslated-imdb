The American icon Henry Fonda portrays "Elegant" John Howard, an elderly truck driver who has regained his beloved big rig "Eleanor" after a long hospital stay that forced him to lose his payments. Deciding that he would like to do just one more perfect round, he escapes from the hospital, kidnaps Eleanor and ties up with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to replace her company with prostitutes. /> <br /> The wonderful performance of Fondas is a natural anchor for a film that tows the strings of the heart as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the most comical scenes. A superb cast including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young assistant, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a delicious ham, as always, in the most blatantly comical part of the photo) helps immeasurably. br /> <br /> The nature at the end of the life of the painting and the intensity of the journey have an incredible weight; this is a picture that provided you with entry, you can remember a long time after it's over. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is vividly shown here; the countryside looks beautiful. Set on the wonderful soundtrack of Craig Safans, it is a remarkable image in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> He loses something in his final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions), but he keeps his good vibes thanks to the charm of his central characters. <br /> <br /> It is not at all the skeletal image of exploitation / drive-in that one might expect from the title (in particular its alternative title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), is a rewarding cinematic experience that I can recommend without scruples. <br /> <br /> 9/10
