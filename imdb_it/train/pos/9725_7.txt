"How to lose friends and alienated people" is not based on Tiger Woods's infidelities. It's a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about his experiences as a journalist covering famous people. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a mad British journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Young is restless to be taken by all kinds of cheaters to alienate everything around him, hence the title of the film. He is amazing, bold and moralist. However, despite some strange reason, he is a rather nice character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the compound Alison Olsen, played admirably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney especially wants the slutty actress Sophie Maes played by the fantastic Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short of acting competence but high on the "eye candy" material. Sidney enters all kinds of antics to climb the journalist's ladder in the magazine co. These are the highlights of the film. However, I think that director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan could lose some viewers and alienate the authentic ROM-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot between Sidney and Alison; although Team Weidstraughan has formulated a funny narrative otherwise. Pegg put his character to the mat with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges was again building bridges "The Dude" with his enigmatic support work like Clayton Harding, his magazine prez. But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy of being presented here. "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" shouldn't be completely alienated, but you could lose some movie friends if you advertise it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
