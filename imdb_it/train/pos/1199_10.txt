This is the most convincing and excellent performance that Robert Taylor has ever given. It even surpasses his wonderful interpretation of "Johnny Eager" which comes 14 years after that film. His looks are still a wonder to behold, but now he has a maturity that gives him the advantage in this gritty and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his race, a buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for pleasure. His killing of wild eyes not only of buffaloes but of human beings is surprising to look at. He is basically a lonely man, who needs the people around him, but doesn't like him for his sociopathic behavior. His companion is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is fed up with the hunt, and only goes ahead, because he is a failure in anything else. Along the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her without success, but sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is a little sad to look at, so fed up with hunting, eager to leave with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan, who is a drunken skinner, is wonderful with his clever cracks and his traditional sound. Russ Tamblyn plays the half race trying to adapt to a white world. The group is a strange mix of good and evil, young and old. Eventually Taylor gets scared by the buffalo, like many other hunters before him, and escapes leaving Sandy with the girl. On his return, that night Sandy left with the woman, giving Charlie the power to kill in search of Sandy and to have the girl for himself. The final show comes in a snowstorm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Taylor's film to the core and he was really a very underrated actor of the time.
