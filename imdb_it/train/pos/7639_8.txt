It's not a great movie. Acting is not amazing (some sub-renters are even misinterpreted), the film is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like great movies, this is not for you. yet it has a great - REALLY GREAT plus on the story. Larry's story works, because we know this story from our lives. The girl we didn't ask for a date, the test we failed, the friend we disappointed, are all in our history. This film works, because it touches it, it's a good story because it's small. It is the life that we all have, with regrets that we all have, yet the message is striking: every life we ​​could have lived would have their negative sides. The first time I saw him, I was 15 years old. It was shown at a party in my school. 16 years later, I keep thinking about it every so often, and every time I see him, he smiles at me. Watch it. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
