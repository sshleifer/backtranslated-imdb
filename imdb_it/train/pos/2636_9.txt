The Lion King series is easily the crowning achievement of Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece of cel animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is the second direct sequel to the video that Disney, or any other studio, has made for an animated film. It deserved a theatrical distribution. The same can be said for this film. It has the original cast, Elton John songs, a hilarious story, exciting action and moments of moving character. Everything you expect from this series. Not so much a new story, but a rich and extensive background on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story. What impressed me most was the care in the animation. Too often, Disney short films on the quality of animation of their video and television efforts. But here, they perfectly mix the new animation with the shooting of the original film. The scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly resume their roles respectively of Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We also have a return visit from Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas. There are many great laughs in this movie. So if you love Lion King, you need this movie. History is not complete without it.
