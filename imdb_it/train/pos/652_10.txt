this film is so complex that it can be supplied with any description and continues to roll with it. you have an insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is trapped between two (no, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see him working with his magic around the three women he loves. this could be the premise for a poultry film, full of rigid, cold and uninteresting comments. but the director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. being such a long film, one can't help but laugh when, after two hours of polite conversation, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly hears himself shouting on the phone while remembering a joke in a movie. this type of situation is purely cinematographic and cannot be completely restored in a comment. nor can anyone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
