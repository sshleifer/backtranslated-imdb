I recently saw I.Q. and even if I'm not a romantic comedy, I think it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many films in my opinion lack honesty. Do you know that feeling when you watch a movie and you just feel ripped off because it's taking something from the story and it was like the director had thrown it together like garbage? The history of scientists is sweet and fun. How they came together and tried to help Tim Robbins' character become intelligent. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and raised an important point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems". I would recommend it for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
