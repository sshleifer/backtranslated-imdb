This is a film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and I'm glad I did! The mix of British humor (I should say, Humor?) And the reality of a lost and middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle was a blast. Add to that the mix of reality of what it takes to actually grow the pot (those plants under the bushes would NOT have been able to do it without the TLC they received), and it's a really fun but moving film. I laugh every time I evoke the vision of all the customers of the bar sitting on their deckchairs with sunglasses to count the lights! Maybe it's just my blood in Mendocino County, but the British have definitely got it right !! 10/10
