Has anyone found it interesting that the Ood looks strangely like the "Great Cthulhu" by H P Lovecraft vintage? hmmm? <br /> <br /> Fantastic couple of episodes (not related to Billie Piper as it almost seems they do!) in The impossible Planet and The Satan Pit. <br /> <br /> Also the link to "Legion" I Also think about who was used in Chi before and was referring to Satan in various post novels of the exorcism era ... <br /> <br /> Great episodes of suspense using elements of fear and faith. The new team for these "who are working on great magic for TV." This certainly creates new fears and "hides behind the sofa" feelings that have not been seen for many, many years in this continuation of a superb BBC series (Sin is confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper is quitting - perhaps not permanently - after the end of series 2): O (((
