'Presque rien' is the story of two young lovers during the summer by the sea. I don't want to tell the plot, because it's not what's more important than this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is cinematography. The visual side of "Presque Rien" is so surprising that it deserves the utmost attention. It leaves you fascinated by its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is shown unevenly, rather complicated. There is no simple chronology nor are there answers to all the questions the film brings. But this is what makes 'Presque rien' even more interesting. I recommend this film to all the people for whom the artistic side of the films is very important and will not be disappointed.
