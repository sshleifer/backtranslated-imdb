The Sentinel presents a sort of mill run and suspense / clich√© mystery but is relieved with good acting and good tension. These stories have already passed for the most part as many permutations as we can bear, so what's left is how good acting is, how smart setups and villains are, how well built the main plot is, etc. Etc. ..... so Sentinel does a solid job given its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both maintain good bravado and attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) offers satisfying support. The whole thing in history is absolutely implausible, but it doesn't deserve. It's worth seeing if you like the genre.
