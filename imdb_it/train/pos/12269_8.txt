Four rough dudes and three sexy girls venture into a remote wooded area to hunt a bear. The heterogeneous group clashed with the crazy Vietnam veteran Jesse (a disturbing and disturbing portrait of Alberto Mejia Baron), who is not surprisingly satisfied with strangers who intrude on his land. The director / co-writer Pedro Galindo III tells the compelling storyline at a steady pace, creates a good dose of nervous tension and provides a good dose of graphic blood with the brutal pieces of murder (a nasty throat slice and a hand wiped out with a brace as the salient points defined macabre and gaudy). The cast of all gives solid performances, with particularly praiseworthy works by Pedro Fernandez such as the friendly and human Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as the feverish Alejandra, Charly Valentino as the lovable Charly, and Tono Mauri as an antagonist Mauricio. Better still, both the greedy blonde Marisol Santacruz and the beautiful brunette Adriana Vega offer delicious sweets for the eyes wearing skimpy swimsuits. The agile, agile cinematography of Antonio de Anda, the breathtaking scenery of Silvana, the solid, vibrant and vibrant soundtrack of Pedro Plascencia, the well developed characters and the pleasant 76 minutes duration further improve the overall sound quality of this up horror / hybrid action winner.
