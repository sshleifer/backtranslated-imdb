Although this beautiful work of art uses part of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is actually nothing of the kind. It is a political and cultural allegory of the post-Colombian odyssey of Mexico, as will also be shown by a brief look at the history of Mexico. <br /> <br /> In contrast to "Like Water for Chocolate", "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet him at least halfway, so that understanding requires some work. (A good starting point is to see the character of the grandmother as Spain: proud, detached, sad and, above all, weighed down by history.) <br /> <br /> The heroin's last actions are obscure because the "result "of history (ie the present) is always obscure, since we are too close to it for an honest assessment. The refusal to tie the loose parts cleanly is the only real choice available to the director, given the film's ambitions. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is wonderful. An experience on the big screen would be ideal if you can capture it in a local art house or in a university screening. But if not, VHS is better than not seeing it at all.
