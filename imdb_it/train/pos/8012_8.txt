As for the Muppet line, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. This has been marketed to children, but has some dark, emotionally disturbing adult moments that parents may not want to expose their children to. One of which stages Miss Piggy who becomes "postal" in a jealous rage, which basically lasts for the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> In addition, however, the story is progressive and very entertaining. A scene where Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go crazy in a department store is simply hilarious! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of lightness and fun. <br /> <br /> I like it a lot, and I still enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> Rate a 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
