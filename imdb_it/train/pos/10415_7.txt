Three flashbacks introduce the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and the princess) who will interact with Ahmad; there are three songs, each linked to those same characters. Three times Ahmad utters the absolute word "Time" in his declaration of love to the Princess, answering his three questions in their first of three meetings. So strong is the impression it provokes, that the Princess will resist Jaffar's three attempts to conquer her - with three successive stratagems: deception, hypnosis and the memory they erase. Yet Jaffar possesses what he describes as the three inescapable tools of domination over a woman: the whip, the power and the sword. There are three flying entities: the mechanical horse, the Genius and the Genius and the magic carpet. The Genius offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three meetings; three times the Genius laughs loudly in the mountain gorges, and three are his considerations on human frailty, before he leaves. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant spiders and giant octopuses). There are three instruments of justice: the magic eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess and the bow and arrow to execute Jaffar. There is magic in the number three, and there is magic in this film.
