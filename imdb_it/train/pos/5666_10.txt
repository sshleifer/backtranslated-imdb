I loved this show when it aired on television and I was crushed when I found out that someone somewhere decided it wasn't worth continuing! For years I hung up my copies of this show, the ones I had recorded or that I had a tape for me. This is until now. The powers that finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD and finally managed to get my hands free on the complete set. Which brings me to this part; the part of this show is everything. <br /> <br /> American Gothic speaks of good evil ways, basically a fight between Lucas Buck (which is Buck, with a B). He's a wicked sheriff in a small South Carolina town that handles things the way he wants things to be managed and stops at nothing to get his way. <br /> <br /> I felt that the show was wonderfully written and directed and so much life still to be lived. I really hated it when it was deleted, but that's how it seems to go for me when I finally find something worth watching on television. Gary Cole did a great job as sheriff Lucas Buck, he has the right amount of charm against evil to make it. The other actors also did a super job, so I guess you could say that casting was a success with me too.
