This was really a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Even Jay Hernandez is a very nice actor who is very fun to watch. The chemistry that the team once had together was spectacular, only serves to show what can be achieved when minds come together as one goal. This team has returned from the abyss, having lost many seasons to win practically everything. I love movies like this, they are really inspirational. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the character of Dennis Quaid has earned a place in the major championships. You can't do anything but cheer on this guy. It seems just when someone should do something, they will. Things happen and they fall into place and make everything click. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really make you think about the fact that "nothing is impossible".
