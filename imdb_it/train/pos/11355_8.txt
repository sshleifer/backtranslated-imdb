I was surprised at how fascinating this film was. The performances were extremely good, especially from Rea as the compassionate and no-frills detective. <br /> <br /> Despite a low budget, no big FX or a flashy camera, Citizen X somehow manages to outperform most of the big Hollywood movies on its own. To tell. The. History. <br /> <br /> Real stories tend to end with a groan rather than a bang, and this is the case, but other than that, this is a highly recommended investigative thread.
