A fusion in a nuclear power plant causes most people to turn into lethal, rotten and brazen zombies, which naturally face a macabre fury. A handful of uninfected people do their best to survive this grueling ordeal. The director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets shows a genuinely sincere affection and passion for the horror race for the throat and the creepy horror: it keeps an incessant and snappy rhythm for everything, fills the screen with crazy wall-to-wall action, and fortunately keeps the terrible dialogue at a minimum level. Furthermore, Sheets does not skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter: this image offers a tasty load of meat in melting flesh, evisceration, a lot of munching guts, a guy has a torn heart, and there is also a nice shot on a tree branch. Sheets earn bonus points for keeping the tone dark and unpleasant at the literal bitter end (for example, almost all the main characters end up becoming zombie chow). Of course, this film has its fair share of flaws: the torn assembly, several attempts at pathos with the ham, and the largely horrible acting of an unnamed cast leaves everyone quite to be desired. The best theatrical awards go to the beautiful and lively Kasey Rausch for his captivating interpretation of Daria Trumillio. Likewise, Frank Dunlay does equally well for the robust army veteran Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets' sure understanding of a sense of infectious slambang of relentless headlong momentum and a clear affinity for the horror genre ensures that this remains a total hoot to watch from beginning to end.
