I recently saw this movie, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a friend of mine and had a great time! This film is a masterpiece of trash. Try looking at it for this purpose! It wasn't intended, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an incredible mix of crazy things. Tomba had just retired from alpine skiing competitions, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomb has won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine World Cup titles. Seriously the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani signed this film. All other indications of Damiani are considerable.
