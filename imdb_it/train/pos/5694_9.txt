Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are fantastic. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, however his performance as John Holmes is superb. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was a bit slow. Wonderland is a film that is able to show you a horrible crime from the point of view of a guy who has just let himself go to his drug habit and lazy about what's going on around. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very clever hustler who is able to go through the most ugly and ugly situations almost unharmed. The film deserves to be seen several times. The sensual and drug-filled seventies atmosphere is surprising.
