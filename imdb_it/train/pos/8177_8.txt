I'm surprised no one has ever thought of making a film like this before. Horror is often the most effective when it uses the unpleasantness of real life as a theme. And nobody (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) loves going to the dentist. Teeth torture has already been done before (see The Marathan Man for example), but this brings terror to the periphery. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who goes mad. Now our dear doctor was not playing with a complete deck to begin with, but driven by jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, he began to devastate the people around him. Mental spiral doctors are quite close to what we see in Michael Douglas' character in Falling Down, but with a horror side. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by the horror authors Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, he is witty and has a great flow. Furthermore, he plays a policeman, Ken Foree is always welcome. <br /> <br /> I now believe that this film would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. Having only seen him in Los Angeles before, I was amazed by his acting. <br /> <br /> Even the sequel The Dentist 2 is worth looking at, but slightly below average compared to the original. <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - A funny film with some scenes that will make you shiver, hooded (pun intended) by a great performance by Bernsen
