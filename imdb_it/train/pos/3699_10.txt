"Who Loves The Sun" makes its way through some thorny topics with sufficient intelligence and grace to keep the story not only engaging, but often hilarious. It's been a while since I found a film so touching and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The film is stunning, attracting attention with beautiful landscapes and tranquil landscapes. The peaceful image contrasts wonderfully with the tension between very human, very imperfect and yet very nice characters. Thanks to the excellent cast, all five main players are extraordinarily interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves The Sun." It's a really fun movie that gives an intense look at the wounds we can inflict on each other, and the incredibly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness.
