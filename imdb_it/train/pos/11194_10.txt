Bad screenplay, bad direction, the best performances, overwhelming dialogue. What more could you ask for? For the laughs, there is nothing better than this. Zadora's over-acting combined with the clich√© scenarios in which she finds herself creating an exhilarating parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap" although clearly not intended as such. Don't miss Ray Liotta's debut line, "It looks like a penis".
