"Father of the Pride" was another one of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life. And this is pretty sad, especially considering that almost always the worst shows are still on the air (think in "The Simple life") I admit that there are many similarities with this show and "The Simpsons", but despite the similarities the show has its merits. The entertainment is adequate, not incredible, but it is good. The best are the characters. All the animals are very nice and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy had their moments. The music was good, I liked many of the songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the show is not very original, I think this has a lot of potential. As "Mission Hill" a show that is not very famous but I liked it a lot, this did not have the appreciation it deserved. What a pity .
