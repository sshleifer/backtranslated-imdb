Philo Vance had many affinities with Bulldog Drummond ?? Was he a gentleman with the kind of elegance and elegance that usually associated with the upper British classes and was also independently wealthy? <br /> <br /> But there were vital differences ?? Drummond was an adventurer, charming, gallant, lively? Vance could be pompous, a bit boring and hypocritical ?? Was there a hint of fundamental cruelty in his ways ?? <br /> <br /> "The Kennel Murder Case" is the most impressive of Vance's 14 films made between 1929 and 1947 ?? The story of a murdered collector of chinoiserie, has all the ingredients of the classic mystery of private eyes ?? exotic setting in the blue nose of the Long Island Kennel Club, three killings for Vance to be solved including a baffling "vault murder", the key to the whole affair, and a lot of suspicions ?? <br /> <br /> Usually, a police script proved to be too static and talkative to make films convincing even though they work quite well on the printed page, but here the direction of Michael Curtiz and the careful editing give the film a rhythm and urgency that make it completely different from similar films of its kind ?? <br /> <br /> The elegance and gentleness of William Powell made him the perfect Vance and although a year later he changed studio, he remained in the same genre with "The Thin Man" by MGM ??
