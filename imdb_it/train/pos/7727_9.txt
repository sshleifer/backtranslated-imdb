FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF movie of the golden age of science fiction cinema and what makes it a great movie is its sense of wonder. As soon as the spaceship lands, the public - via the human crew of the ships - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and discover the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell who died overnight. Or did they do it? <br /> <br /> You can make a mess and say that the planet is obviously shot in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds a sense of threat of claustraphobia that I hear and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron adds even more atmosphere <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this film is not among the first 250 IMDb films.
