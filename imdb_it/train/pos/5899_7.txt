Nice idea ... saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a tiny little county of Lampidorra. That country, which was not even in North America, was made the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at that time, since this was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country that has inherited, and we follow it as it tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even stranger people. At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people, the Navajo, and from there it becomes more and more silly ... even if Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and ubiquitous smile never get ruffled. There are other songs scattered everywhere as citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Shot in a glorious English version of Technicolor, or something similar, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as a British cheese seller Tony Craig. Bogarde made a big leap in the British film industry after serving the war, and was knighted by QE II. Craig and "the new princess" continue to slam against each other, and their adventures intertwine more as Lampidorra's financial problems worsen ... A funny little farce ... along the lines of the movie of Marx Brothers. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the screenwriter and director of our small project, and he was married for 50 years! Guest was best known for writing and directing his sci-fi films, both in the UK and in the United States.
