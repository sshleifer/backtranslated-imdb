First a quick 'shut up!' to those who say this movie stinks. You can't go to every movie waiting for "Citizen Kane". This was actually a funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this film is, I don't think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have focused more on this. In addition to this, the film is a lot of fun. Selma Blair needs to eat something. You are worrying me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or a light entertainment on Saturday afternoon. Go look. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 on ****
