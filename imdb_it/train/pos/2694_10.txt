Garde à Vue must be seen a number of times to understand the sub-frames it contains. If you are not used to movies of French words, based on conversation and the battle of ingenuity rather than action, don't even try to watch it. You will only get bored to the death and reassure the opinion that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a long-winded film, based essentially on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) and cruelly cuts the veil of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a murdering child rather than telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he has an 8-year sexual relationship. The wife knows, she is jealous and prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still the death penalty) rather than revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of her pitiful life.
