SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film of my life because it is the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my hometown as a 4-year-old boy. The story is based on the novel by Sheila Burnford, and it is a reason why it is not possible to write it as a clone of Lassie without a brain. <br /> <br /> The basic story: two dogs and a cat live happily in The Seaver family, when it is the new husband of the mother of three children, receives a job in the city and has to move temporarily inside San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they pay attention to are particularly strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan have their hearts broken like children, even though the young and carefree American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less worried and a bit cynical (due in part to his voice-over which explains that he was abandoned as a puppy, collected in an animal shelter and purchased by the family), although his growth as a character throughout history provides much of the important storytelling. <br /> <br /> The three animals escape the ranch and head towards the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings), guided by Shadow's instinct of direction. They encounter various dangers along the way, hoping to return home, while the family and guests of the ranch suddenly worry about the disappearance of the animals. There are fun moments to the end, a great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a moving camaraderie that grows among the main characters during the course of the narration, punctuated by moments of sadness (as when the Sassy's arrogance in trying to cross a river without getting wet makes them fall into the river and be washed down by a waterfall, leaving a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the spectators). <br /> <br /> Somehow though, I can't see what the addition of saving the girl lost in the desert adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a bit pointless as part of the story. <br /> <br /> The ending raises the stakes when the shadow falls into a well in a train field and hurts the leg, finds it difficult to get out and give up, exhausted, followed by Chance he climbs with him to convince him to go out, telling him how important it is for him and how he pushed them so far that he didn't have to throw it all away so easily. <br /> <br /> The way this scene (brilliantly concluded) is not finished leaves an ambiguity that continues in the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. So, just as it all seems lost, it appears slowly, and rejoins the family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the camaraderie that developed between him and his companions on the journey, and the realization of what is really from his long road to get there, leaves a nice epilogue to show how much his character has grown, but also like the other two. Wait a second, I think I'm about to cry ... <br /> <br /> However, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie are. But this is a film that the whole family can watch, and while the tots will love talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot better (as I discovered when I saw the movie again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you haven't seen it, go out and get it! <br /> <br /> And please avoid the sequel (see my review of Homeward Bound II!)
