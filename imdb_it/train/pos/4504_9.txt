Here I thought "Nanook of the North" was the last word in archaic semi-doc "eskimo" films. How wrong! As an avid sea navigator, I stayed up until 330 to see him hoping to see some handmade "skin boats". The film did not disappoint me. Any kayak / umiak construction student should take a look here. (Note to SK friends: it looks like they are using Norton Sound kayaks with single-blade paddles). <br /> <br /> But the film went far beyond this clearly restricted interest. Although there have been like some others have noticed some small bits of fiction, the film has so much heart that they are only a minor annoyance. It was (from the point of view of this very amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect time to make this film. First thirty: the "talkies" are so new that (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually let the Inuit speak in their language. And there is so much that has remained, despite the melodrama infusion, authentic. They are really hitting the polar bear, that whale and those caribou. A 1950s version of this film would have been so poor with "stars", Technicolor, etc. The 70s version? Not even. An excellent accompaniment to this excellent film is "The White Shadows in the Southern Seas" (1928) Geographically, the mirror image of "Eskimo" also deals with the shocking and profound rupture of Western culture / technology on an unsuspecting population.
