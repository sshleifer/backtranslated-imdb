Hidden Frontier is a fan made show, in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after the Voyager has returned from the Delta quadrant. He has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original for the show. The show takes place on the basis of Deep Space 12 stars and on different spaceships, which give him opportunities that the official shows do not have. The characters have the opportunity to rise in the hierarchy, which the characters in shows with only one ship do not have. The show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the acting takes place in front of the green screen and gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most are fine. The episodes are driven by the characters and the characters develop on many episodes. This is a bit more like Babylon 5 than in most of the official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series have shrunk from use. All in all I enjoyed watching it.
