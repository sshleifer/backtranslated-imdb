Previously I thought this film was the weakest of the Muppet movies. I would now like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion, now, the most famous film MUppet was the TV movie. IT'S A VERY GOOD MESTINO Christmas, it's A WONDERFUL LIFE that was really terrible. MUPPATI TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but more enjoyable miles than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the song 'You Can Not Take No For An Answer', the one that the Muppet Babies sing and the songs for the great finale itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I was told it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) <br /> <br /> The MANHATTAN MELODIES show was the true performance, with The Muppets of Sesame Street also appearing for marriage. How Kermit puts in his last line 'what better way could something end?' But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a little more fun. There are some pretty cameos by Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence by Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the deceased, great Jim Henson himself) and the film definitely entertains. I must say though that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definitive MUppet films.
