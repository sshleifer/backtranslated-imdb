I saw him at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will imagine that the level of entertainment during the film will be largely based on the level of acceptance of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, it was well done, well acted and a nice score. If you arrive in Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater. I have never been in a more beautiful theater with regards to picture quality, sound quality and atmosphere in my whole life ... I wonder if the Church would allow me to see Batman Begins there! Being that I am ON THE UNITED STATES and consider Joseph as a prophet, I have been touched in several places and have been brought to tears several times ... which I assume is expected from the moment they distributed the tissues BEFORE the film began ! However, I have been told that this film is available in different LDS Visitor Centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes of control because if you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
