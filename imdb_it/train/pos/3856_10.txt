"De vierde man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country, before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with films like "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" talks about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) go to the sea to recover. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fatal love affair with her. Become addicted to her with heart and soul and discover that her three previous husbands died of mysterious circumstances ... <br /> <br /> "De vierde man" is very much influenced by the old Hollywood movie noire and from the psychopathic thriller by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes a long time to create a dark and compelling atmosphere, and some moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to carry the story forward. The suspense is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes recalls the works of the Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, in particular the performance of Krabbe as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the doors to his international film career ("The Living Daylights", "The Fugitive"). If you have the chance to watch this brilliant psychological thriller on TV, video or DVD, don't miss it!
