This is one of the best comedies ever! The writing of this soap parody is brilliant and the cast, well, just look at the names of the cast and you will understand why it is so beautiful. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, make (as always) a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you don't laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
