I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it. I am a screenwriting student and I loved the way minor characters intervened just when something important / climate was happening in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is rather shocking - at one point Barbara Stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's boyfriend; And rekindling a passion in the husband who has not seen for ten years; And with the firearm signal 'two shots and then one' she connects with her old Dutch shag mate (the reason she left the city in the first place!) EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME! The moral majority must have been totally furious when they saw this film in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Loving costumes and cinematography and direct dialogue from the hip - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co doing the 'Bunny' Hug 'is a good reason to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of that period that I have seen for a long time.
