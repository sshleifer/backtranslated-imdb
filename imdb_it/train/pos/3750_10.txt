This is a great success. I think every voice is made by Jason Steele. (you can only barely tell if you've already heard his normal voice, so don't worry about it sounding the same way. They don't.) it takes about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> spatula is fighting the war against spoons and meets some strange people. in fact, everyone you know seems pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "general peterson, we must take you to a medical department!" "No, I won't do it Edward." "Don't talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I went away Edward, and you know ... before I go ..." "Yes?" "Can I just have ... a kiss?" "umm, no". "come on, just one, baby, pecked on the lips?" "I'm running away, sir." <br /> <br /> there will be a movie soon. the date for this is September, but it will probably be rejected.
