This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this, the dead (called zombies) have arisen to eat the living. However a company has developed a collar that, when placed around the neck of the zombies, makes them servile docile and perfect. Robinson Helen's mother (Carrie-Anne Moss), dad Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) take on a zombie because everyone in their block already has one. Tim calls the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see this is - among many other things - a take-off of the "Lassie" series with Fido which is a substitute for Lassie. Timmy was named like that for a reason! Here all the famous episodes of Lassie are filmed. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the zombies eat it! It is also a satire of those films by Douglas Sirk from the 1950s where everything is bright and colorful - but dark secrets are tearing people to pieces. The characters wear VERY luminous dresses from the 50s (Moss is always in a dress) - the furnishings, the settings and the machines in particular are all from the 1950s in hyper-bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive there is always something to watch. The script is good, but there are only so many Lassie lines you can make. Melodramatics are kind of a fool but the cast pulls him out. Everyone here is excellent and focused on the target. Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - playing every line for all its value --- but never overdo it. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost on most people and gore is quite meek. The gore is made so casual and with a cheerful music that plays on it it is difficult to take it seriously. So for some people, it will really work. I give him an 8.
