An extra is called to play a general in a film about the Russian revolution. However, it is not an ordinary extra. He is Serguis Alexander, a former general commander of the Russian armies who is now forced to relive the same scene, in which he suffered a professional and personal tragedy, to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and who had been humiliated by Alexander. Now may be the time for this destroyed man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. This is a powerful film with a meticulous direction by Von Sternberg, which provides the greatest irony in Alexander's character in every possible way. Jannings earned his Oscar for the role with a very moving performance interpreting the general at his peak and in his deepest valley. Powell offers sinister support as a director of revenge and Brent is perfect in his role with his face and his movements that show the same expression of Jannings' love. All around brilliance. Evaluation, 10.
