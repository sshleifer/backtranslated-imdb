This western is done differently than many others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. The way it is presented makes a more interesting slice of Americana. I would have preferred to see it on the big screen than on tape, but it's worth a look to see what life was like in the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excel in this film.
