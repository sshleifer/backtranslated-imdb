I watched this film a second time to try to understand why it hadn't had the success (commercial or artistic) that it should have been, and I discovered a considerable artistic merit - which may have been its commercial failure in the end. /> <br /> First of all, this film attempts "serious" science fiction, social commentary, rather than action-adventure. There is action in it, but it is not exactly what it speaks of. If you focus on this, you will end up with (as others have noted) a bad "Alien" clone. But again, this is not what this is about. <br /> <br /> The film really talks about the transformation of Todd (Kurt Russell) from the human to the quasi-machine and return to the human (mainly * back *). But since he's not trying to give you a typically Hollywood answer, Kurt Russell has to make this transformation without speaking, and largely without generic expressions. And it really does a great job - it can take two visions to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is imperfect and is never adequately explained if Todd's ability to stand up to an apparently superior army of troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or from his new humanity or what, but the film still represents a wonderful showcase for Russell's talent (easy to underestimate).
