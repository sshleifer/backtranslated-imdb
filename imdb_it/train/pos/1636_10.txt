This is one of the greatest films of the 80s !!! He leans like an "asshole in a punchbowl" !! I can't believe that Mad Magazine reported it or anything. Yet they proudly put their name on a show with "Stuart", "I-speak-a-no-enlish Chinese lady" and "UPS guy on speed". What happens with that? AND, I LOVE Ron Leibman, it's foxy !! I wonder why he removed his name from the credits? It was his most amusing role I know. Of course, he's not as foolish as he was in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this film is right there with National Lampoon's Vacation. If you like movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or any of the other 80's-centered movies, you'll like it !! Rent it and you'll see what I mean !!
