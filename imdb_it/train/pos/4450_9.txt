An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. Do you wander through the woods to witness a murder, but have you seen the murder or are you losing your mind? Is he getting old? The film is fantastic because the viewer has to decide for himself what is happening. There is very little dialogue in this film but it does not need words, the whole film speaks for itself. You knew what was happening and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The other part that I liked was the shots of the woods in late autumn and winter. They were beautiful but the only thing I didn't like was the sight of the old man in his underwear. He could have tied the tunic a little tighter but, apart from that, it was a pretty deep film.
