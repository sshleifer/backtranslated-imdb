The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the successful Danish television series is slightly lower than the first, but it also has a lot of laughter and fear. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, like the monster child and his demon-like father. Other important parts this time are Dr. Krogshoj of Søren Pilmark, who faces Dr. Hurmer's horrible revenge, and once again, patient Mrs. Drusse tries to solve the mysteries, Miss Marple. He ends up in a cliffhanger and after the death of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you wonder how they will be able to do Part III, but I hope that Von Trier will give it a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Down's number 2 dishwasher, died soon after. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
