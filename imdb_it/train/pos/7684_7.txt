Reading all the comments are very exciting. but someone can tell me the name of the true artist who painted the images for the good times transmitted. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family, but there was a real family that has the true artist, and has not yet had any credit in this view. So if you don't mind if someone can say the name of the true artist I would also like to say "well done work". I know this Vista is for the cast of GOOD TIMES but, he wouldn't agree that it even touched the hearts of all of us. I'd like to know if he's still painting or, if he's still alive. I would like to have some of his works exhibited in my house.
