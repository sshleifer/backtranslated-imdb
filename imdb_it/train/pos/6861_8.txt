When you compare what Brian De Palma was doing in the 80s for what goes on today for entertainment, his films keep looking better and better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all superb works by a filmmaker at the height of his powers: the boy has had a long series of films better than the average. This is pure Hitchcock with a hint of 80s perversion, an affectionately told story of lust and murder with abundant twists, huge aids of style, an extraordinary soundtrack by Pino Donaggio, and a trash plot, of yellow inspiration. camera work and sensual, bloodstained images help to overcome logical holes while the formidable performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in all respects), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at the 'epoca) and Michael Caine make every scene special: let the virtuoso take you into a surreal, frightening odyssey full of eroticism and you'll enjoy every frame of "Dressed To Kill".
