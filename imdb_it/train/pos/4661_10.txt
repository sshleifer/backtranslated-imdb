I can only echo the praise of the other reviews here. It is a delightful film with a wellness factor that it manages to reach without crossing the line in a sloppy sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. <br /> <br /> A small point: it seems to me that the slight objections raised about Ustinov's character that Pendelton is able to enter and defeat the security of the system ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant to this genre of things. Yes, the film was rather computer illiterate, but it showed Pendelton "studying computers" in his apartment, and I think the implication should have been that his gifts would allow him to swallow the whole subject, practically from one day to other. <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments when he appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure we should believe that Pendelton was cleverly able to get out of these situations, or if he was actually expert enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear. <br /> <br /> Certainly he had to know enough to set up fictitious accounts. Presumably Wallach and Ustinov relied on their rather hazy idea of ​​how computers worked in those days, and to understand in detail what they were going towards, it was necessary to know exactly what their concept was. They knew there was something "procedure" that was important; they thought the "intelligent light" could actually control security, rather than simply indicating its status; they thought that the features of the user terminal (stupid) would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - even if apart from things like the graphic feature I don't see it alone. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think he tried to avoid the subject of computer operations as much as possible, and they did quite well. By allowing them some artistic license, I don't think their efforts have any noteworthy flaws. <br /> <br /> CD
