A powerfully wonderful film. You are held in a deadly grip once you get involved in the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is torn into a life crisis of balancing his career with his family. He notices his former college roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He discovers that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the September 11 attack in America, is no longer in touch with reality ... choosing to engage his mind with his favorite music of the past and video games. The former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their previous bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to free Charlie from his pain ... but it's Alan who manages to bring his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Still in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Exceptional soundtrack with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but I found it exceptional in this role. In some scenes I thought aloud ... because he was never contacted to play the songwriter Bob Dylan in a biographical film.
