A bizarre and ingenious combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary who tries to save his boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious "ghost" woman and Franchot Tone as a crazed and killer sculptor. There are also some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged trap drummer, as well as other characters that make up parts of the conspiracy. If you are used to seeing Raines in healthier parts, you are allowed to exaggerate, especially in his scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays a very different person and, although not a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too contrived, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
