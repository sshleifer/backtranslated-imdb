Like the Thousand and One Nights, this film plays with narrative conventions to make us feel the plot, the plot and the plot: it opens with what appears to be a blind man's device that tells the story of his life, then plunges into a a flashback that takes us to the present of the blind, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (It must be admitted that the second half is not up to the promise of the first.) Like the Thousand and One Nights, it tries to cram as many of the Middle East's engines as possible into the only work. A liberated genius, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea journeys, a crowded market, a bad vizier, jewels ... I don't know why everything works, but it does. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is particularly beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he is Hungarian in a Persian way.
