What can you say about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the king of blaxploitation films of level Z, and here he is back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is an exceptional rollercoaster ride of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence and a lot of other things you would never find in modern movies (or any movie, actually, haha! ). The stand-up routine that gives in advance is not to be missed! In any case, D2 is definitely a fun way to lose an hour or so. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and doesn't have a class! I'm gon 'rock this gun on his * beep * a **!"
