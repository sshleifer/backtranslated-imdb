I saw this today with my 8 year old son. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that it is not the book I can remember at all, but we still liked it. All children are pretty good and overall very funny. Billy is the new baby who accepts the school bully's courage to eat 10 worms in one day. If he loses, he has to walk down the corridor to school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film is set to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and vomits almost at everything. The hilarity follows a lot of different ways to cook worms. A good message on how to deal with bullies and, of course, a happy happy ending.
