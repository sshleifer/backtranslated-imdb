Funny film, evocative, confused, brilliant. It reminds me of L'Age D'Or from Bunuel or Holy Mountain by Jodorowsky - lots of strange characters chatting and looking for ... what is it? I laughed almost all the time, always keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and sometimes horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Entertaining from end to end, up to the guts and bowels poisoned to the end, if it were an end. I just hope to remember every detail. Sometimes it haunts me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, though, I have only the most positive memories of this movie. Since it doesn't seem to be available to take home and watch, I suppose I'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes back on my way with his Big Slide Show (and the next screening of "What is it?"). .. I saw this movie in Atlanta almost immediately after being involved in a rather devastating car accident, so at the time I was a little dazed, which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch prophetic-speaking arthropods and retarded in costumes from superhero and divinity Glover in his appropriate setting from burly-Q, little-dressed girly emerging from the floor like a magnificent DADA-wet dream. <br /> <br /> Is it a statement about life as we know it? Of course, everyone expects art to be just that. I rather think that the truth is more evident in absences and in negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to deduce, but it is much more valid than the lies that other people feed us day after day. Rather one "WHAT IS IT?" of 5000 films like "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (thrill, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (also a funny man to watch on the screen or on his Big Slide Show - smart, funny, eccentric and outrageously hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
