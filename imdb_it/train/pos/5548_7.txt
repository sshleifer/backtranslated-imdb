Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with his two editing cameramen and assistant Clarence Brown - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor and isolated Scottish islanders - the same territory that Michael Powell would play twenty years later for his first big success. The visions of wind and waves, the silhouettes of sun lovers do not just complete the story, they are the story of the struggle against adversity. <br /> <br /> The actors bring the dignity of proud people into their roles and Pickford is brilliant as his character fights with his duties as head of the clan, oscillating between comedy and concern, here with his father's whip whipping the rebellious islanders in church, sitting there with the guest's staff in his hand like a scepter, discussing his lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joy as a whole. I tried, but I couldn't.
