(Sorry for my bad language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a film that requires almost an overwhelming reaction. Personally I agree on all those superlatives that are around. But I will not use this semi-empty way to describe the film here. Because those "perfect! The only-one! Better-ever!" - reviews make some people move away (me included). <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another "Hamlet" that has the potential to rival many movies and all those movies - so don't miss this if you happen to find it anywhere. (Unfortunately not too many people will have any chance of seeing it. There seems to be no DVD out there, and the German version - which is quite well made - is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> In case you decide to get a copy: Save that two-hour reduced version (or so) of this movie. It's useless and not funny, and it gives the wrong impression of a film, which it deals with in an interesting way with flow and architecture. And it is also paralyzed in 4: 3 proportions. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
