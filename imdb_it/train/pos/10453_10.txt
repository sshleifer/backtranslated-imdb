While traveling by train across Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite novels, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low-cost movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are great. The direction is incredible, transmitting Celine and Jesse's feelings to the viewer. I have just completed my review number 1,000 on IMDb, and chose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number because it's a very special film for me. I can't understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar, with such a magnificent script, direction and performance. Yesterday I probably saw this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
