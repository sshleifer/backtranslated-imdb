I went to The Straight Story expecting a sad / happy type of drama with good direction and good acting. These I had. What I did not expect was an allegory for the proofs of human existence. Leave Lynch a simple story of a 300-mile journey on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you haven't noticed, look at it again, paying attention to the age of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he is going through, the reactions people give him, the kind of discussions that ha (one of the first concerns pregnancy and children, one of the latter is outside a cemetery). The last road that leads down is particularly disturbing in this context, as it narrows and its fear and nervousness increase. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of its engine relative to an afterlife, in which it reaches the desired meeting. <br /> <br /> I just hope that some people who have branded this as a slow and mushy melodrama take the time to look at it with more holistic attention.
