I watched it over Christmas, I don't know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I looked at it, so here we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a film that I look through with a big stupid smile on my face and it's a mixture of special performances, great cheerful music and a crackling screenplay of wit and charm that causes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that could be hated very easily (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself) but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is as good as Linda Morolla, a queens waitress who manages to pull off the hard / soft inside Mrs. Arthur who almost renounces her world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them tastefully. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check if you need an elevator is a good movie.
