This is a great film, and a pity that you will receive little attention outside the copyright circles and the students who stay until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but works very effectively, the blurring between childhood fantasy and incisive nightmare is very well shaded. The budget seems rather low, but to the credit of the people involved it is not shown too often. It is also not dated that much. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to record this article when it was a few years ago, and resisted half a dozen views. It is one of those films that everyone will not like; although as usual, those with a more considerate approach to cinema would get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke does a good performance as Anna, the spoiled brat and it's a shame that seems to have gone from the acting scene. Cross is also very good, bringing his character's stature very well in the context of the photo. <br /> <br /> There are some moments of genuine disturbance (and I don't say them slightly) in this film, both half-second shocks and strained tensions. Watch it with the lights out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
