if you have the chance to see this movie, do it. it's pretty shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important problems but it's not educational. I think it's a beautifully filmed work of art, great music of many styles, the typically impressive level of acting that is expected of BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (billed as 'Natalie' Press) is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the stability of the sometimes unnerving action and the comforting spectator in the knowledge that someone out there is actually 'normal', but the real star as always is Timothy Spall - certainly one of the greatest actors of our time!
