Superbly developed characters in so many fun situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, funny, interesting, unpredictable. The best point of a film: the characters, then the humor, the story and the dialogues. Humor has an "inner development", rare in Serbian films. Therefore, it is a consequence of characterization, it is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. He is also sharp, intelligent and lucid. Most films, unfortunately, had built humor (inventing a joke and putting it in the mouth of a character) or an ordinary comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the "immortality of art" are incorporated into this film. Small masterpiece, difficult to reach.
