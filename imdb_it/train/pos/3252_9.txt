The story of "A Woman From Nowhere" is rather simple and practically adapted by an Eastwood Spaghetti Western: a mysterious stranger enters a lawless city run by a kingpin and starts shooting on the spot. Even the titles and the music have that little bit of spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud of it. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the place is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this actioner, there is a considerable amount of firearms, some of which are good, some are predictable, and some points are a bit picky, but it's very funny. Ryoko handles his weapons with credibility and aplomb and gives the delinquents due to them. For her it was not a great challenge for art as it was a physical challenge, but she managed things very well. He shows his acting skills much more like Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi." I highly recommend the film if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I adore) and / or a fan of "girls with guns" and holds up to repeated visions. For me, there is something eminently and inexplicably appealing in the films "girls with guns" like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And having a wonderful girl like Ryoko who plays him is just a drop of icing on the cake.
