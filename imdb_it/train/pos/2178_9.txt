With a lot of sun, fluffy light and shadow that filter through the windows and into the rooms, following the shots that move between the crowd with the hand-held camera, the quick retouching and extreme close-ups here and there, photography is the what in this interesting, artistically made film. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film starts as a bit of fluff on a beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local pool, where we meet the adorable Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a little ostentatious in front of the men with their mouths open by the pool, immediately decides to enter to represent France in the Miss Europe beauty contest, much to the displeasure of her jealous and very nosy boyfriend (a rather annoying type, really). Strutting down the runway the ten competitors show themselves in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (I wondered, the girls could not walk more slowly to prolong their time - and then applaud - su on the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon chased by a prince and a maharaja, but her hot-headed lover does not appreciate the attention that was given to her by other men or by her adoring audience, I suppose the desire only in her house, to cook her meals and stay away from view, eh?!). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps to enhance this film, but it is really the way it is photographed that aroused my interest. A little distraction is the strange dubbed sound, which is a little off. The print on this version seemed very clear and full of nice contrast though. Looking at this I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually, and I found the film excellent, it's worth seeing.
