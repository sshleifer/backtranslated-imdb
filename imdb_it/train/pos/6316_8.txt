This is not a "loose", but a precise, faithful remake of the classic Monicelli "I Soliti Ignoti" of 1958 with Toto ', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinal, etc. And that's the reason, copy all the funny characters and the plot, even in the details (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). I've seen the wonderful old version many times and I have memorized all the gangs and the ending but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the life and modalities of small thieves in Italy in the 1950s have been adapted to the United States in 2002. Things have not changed much. 8/10.
