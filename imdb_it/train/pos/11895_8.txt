Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who is going through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but has a cost. He wants to legitimize photography, but is hired to work for tabloids like paparazzi. His boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. TEA's Nora was starting to become a rather memorable character, but the network didn't support comedy and they still don't. Even when they brought George Wendt to Cheers, they made unnecessary changes to the cast and characters. The show was fine at the beginning and the public was getting used to it, but then the net made it a bad plastic surgery.
