Sarah Silverman's program is very similar to Sarah's; It's so exaggerated with prejudices that you can't take it to heart. The fact is, however, that while most people "understand" it, it does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you can also let it go. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode so far has been as good as the last one. <br /> <br /> Like all the shows, however, it's not perfect. I personally love the program, but there are some huge flaws with it. Racist songs are fun, but they age much faster than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I also had with "Jesus is Magic". It seems that Silverman has given itself a share for the songs by episode that does not need to exist. Not to mention the fact that, while the lyrics of the songs he writes are good, the music, well, it's not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show for some reason attracts Monty Python fans, Upright Citizens Brigade, etc., it doesn't look like these shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this show, I can't look beyond the half-hour limit at a time. It becomes flat very quickly. The repetition value for this show is also low - the second time it's a pretty funny episode, and for the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. <br /> <br /> However, the first time is very, very funny. Give it a shot.
