After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99 $ basket of the Future Shop, I decided to try it without any previous knowledge and be a big fan of the Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a funny and intelligent movie with solid performance. The film moves well, obviously has another solid performance by Warren Beatty, but the real stars of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to discover that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a gangster above the attempt to bring down the city. Madonna was fantastic as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go with the attitude of wanting to watch a funny, intelligent movie with great acting and a solid script, try Dick Tracy. I don't think you'll be disappointed. And look at the cameos of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.
