I love Montecarlo and I really enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I didn't know Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very nice, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the girl rejected with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day like the bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a beautiful ignored vulnerable housewife. Delightful ensemble cast. A lot of talent, smart script, a lot of success and beautiful locations. Just a nice take for a squalid day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is nowhere on the horizon.
