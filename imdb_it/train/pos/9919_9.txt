Mesmerizing, breathtaking and terrifying, this incredibly beautiful film is "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slow in rhythm, calm in the mood, it gives good glimpses of the poisoned spots on the Earth that could be the signs of an inevitable destiny. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt in my mind - nature is tormented and we are the disease. Greed, the very essence of humanity that guides evolution and progress, has turned us into something like cancer, in its way of consuming the guest and dying with it ... <br /> <br /> Manufactured landscapes is a pretty memorable viewing experience - at least I will never again keep my toaster and iron the same way.
