I thought that racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear were grossly oversized for the Hollywood effect. I do not believe that the U.S. S. Navy has ever been openly racist. I can't imagine a full captain, the commanding officer, who ever told his boss he intentionally wanted someone. Certainly not at the risk of his life. And there has never been a chief petty officer as a brazen prejudice against everyone, but WASP as a DeNiro character. No boss, as sloppy and drunk as he was being played, would have ever taken the lead of Master Chief. Cuba Gooding has saved an otherwise ill-made film.
