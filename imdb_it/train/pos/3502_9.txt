Wow! I loved this movie and I LOVE Judy Marte !! This girl is not just a pretty pretty face, it's fun and really very talented !! It made me laugh many times just being very natural with Victor hitting her desperately! We will see it a lot in the coming years ... and probably also from director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Breeding Victor Vargas is one of the best films I've seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, beautiful, fun, well shot, it has everything: good story, good actors, good film direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow, real urban films, like maybe Jersey Girl by Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It's better!
