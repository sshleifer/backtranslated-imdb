My favorite kind of movie is western, it's really the only kind of movie of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, nobody really likes Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top of my list of the ten western favorites is Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only the black and white film from the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a reference film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of profits rather than a direct salary from Universal. Many of these agreements have been followed for the players, making them as rich as the magnates who employed them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann had mostly done B-images until then, noir-like stuff without real budgets. Shortly before Winchester 73 Mann had made a good western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, who never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided that Mann was the person he decided to collaborate with. <br /> <br /> In this film Mann also developed a mini corporation for which John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart others in the cast such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in Mann's future films. <br /> <br /> It's a simple storyline, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Henry Henry Brown and killing him. Because I won't say it, but until that moment we had never seen such a cold fury from James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann has reached the soul of Jimmy Stewart and has dragged out some demons that we all fear to have. <br /> <br /> Hatred is rightly demonstrated at a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stewart and partner Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because the guns are not transported to Earp's Dodge City. There is a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is the Dutchman Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer enter the saloon and Stewart and McNally can be seen at the same time and come to draw weapons that are not there. Look at the close-ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character played by Stewart in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea's finest moment on the screen. He is an outlaw psychopathic killer who is as deadly as a left-handed designer even though he wears two six guns. <br /> <br /> Another person whom Stewart meets is Shelley Winters whose fiance is pushed into a showdown by Duryea and killed. His best scenes are with Duryea who has taken a fantasy for her. Play for a while until he can get away from him. Guess who he ends up with? <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there is not a discordant note in the cast. John McIntire as an unlucky Indian merchant, Jay C. Flippen as the army sergeant brigade and Rock Hudson got his first real warning as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, better known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenic and Old Lace has a short but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart made eight films together, five of which were westerns, and were ready to make a sixth western, Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann left the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that has produced some quality films.
