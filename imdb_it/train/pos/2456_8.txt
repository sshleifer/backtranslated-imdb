When I went to see this movie my expectations were really low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to watch a boring hit movie, but actually the plot is interesting and well done, the acting was pretty convincing - especially by Melville who really shows his talent in this movies, and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this film deserves a wider audience than it received. It is a film, which can be seen by the whole family - perhaps not the smallest of children, since it contains rather rough scenes. A film about love and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is very similar to "Fold it like Beckham", but in reality I think this film twists it better.
