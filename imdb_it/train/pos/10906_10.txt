I have a two year old son who suffers from the same conditions as Jonny Kennedy. I've never had the chance to meet him, but I've never heard anyone say a dirty word about him. I hope he knows how much the realization of this program has helped his suffering comrades by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man touched people in a way that a million charity pamphlets couldn't. I believe this should be the mandatory vision in schools. I also agree with the other comments - what should I complain about? He took everything life could throw at him and still managed to maintain a sense of humor. God bless you. I couldn't see the part that showed the change in his medications. I have enough problems with my son.
