Watched last night, it was overwhelmed by the sincere plot, the excellent development of the character and the good karmic atmosphere emanating from the acting and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without revealing too much of the plot, start with an ordinary joe who goes every day in his office work that is inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be quiet on the dance floor learn the lessons about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it's not exactly so easy to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the United States <br /> <br /> film is carefree; you'll laugh out loud at some gags of sight. However, it is also dignified in a way that is difficult to describe. All the characters in the film are taken seriously, as they are, and none has diminished because of their "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I thought about taking social dance lessons with some friends. So it happened that a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so because now I'm really geeks to try it. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family film (small children might not understand it, but certainly teenagers would) and smile at the genuine care you see shown over and over again. <br /> <br /> Because they would do a remake of Shall We Dance it is a mystery, since it is perfect as it is.
