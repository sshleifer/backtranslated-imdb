Action. Comedy. Suspense. This film has it all. <br /> <br /> The plot says that 4 would be professional thieves are invited to take part in a robbery in a small town in Montana. every kind of character from the crime archetype is here. Frank, the main mind. Carlos, the weapons expert. Max, the explosives expert. Nick, the safe cracker and Ray, the car man. Unfortunately for Frank, he is captured by two clumsy detectives (portrayed very well by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who chased him from New Jersey after sending letters to the other 4. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the train station and from the beginning none of them love or trust each other. Added to the mix is ​​the fact that Frank is gone and I'm not sure why they called together. <br /> <br /> Now Frank is brought back to New Jersey by the 2 detectives but soon he escapes on foot and tries to return to the boys who have problems of all kinds. <br /> <br /> Really a great movie full of laughter and great acting. Just a good movie for all those looking for a laugh or something different
