I have never seen a film by Barbara Steele that I did not like, and I have always been a crap of a good ghost house plot (especially for wonderful images like "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of "The Haunting "" and "House on Haunted Hill"), so I had the feeling that "Castle of Blood" would be my alley. And boy, has it ever been! This Italian-French co-production, although not the classic or the first film horror by Steele, "Black Sunday", remains to this day, it is still an extremely suggestive and chilling entry in the spook genre. Shot in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely gruesome miasma.The film is about a journalist who bets on Lord Blackwood is an author by the name of Edgar Allen Poe who can spend the night in Blackwood Castle on All Saints' Night, when the spirits of those killed in the castle recall their destiny. i, and they are pretty horrible, for the most part. The film actually sends shivers to the viewer's spine, and in the uncut DVD I've just seen - thanks to the good people of Synapse - it also features an amazing topless scene and some bland lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this film; its otherworldly beauty is put to good use with a sympathetic spectrum. His mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable. Not for nothing was it called "The Queen of Horror".
