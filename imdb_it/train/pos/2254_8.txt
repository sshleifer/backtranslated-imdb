Fox's epic tale of one of America's greatest pioneering efforts comes on DVD with some truly exceptional "extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG (The "Frontiersman" was added to the European version), telling the story of the great pioneer leader, who led members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) in the Salt Lake Valley to In 1847, after the mob killed their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), he was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a bold move for the Fox leader, Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, as this was the first attempt to show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought this film in DVD format in an extraordinary edition. Mr. D'Arc, who made his doctoral thesis on the film a few years ago, provided one of the most in-depth pieces of commentary ever made for a DVD. It separates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why these films were so appreciated by Church leaders, even if embellishments to the truth are present in the film. One of the funniest aspects of the information concerns Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the main role. Many years after the film, he married a Latter-day Saint woman and eventually converted to the faith of Latter-day Saints. There is a lot to learn from D'Arc's knowledge and it's nice to have it as part of the DVD! There are over 100 images from the Fox & BYU archives included on the disc, as well as newsreel footage of the extraordinary seven-screen premiere in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another great DVD - and thanks, James D'Arc for your great comment!
