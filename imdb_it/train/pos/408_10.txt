I can't tell you how much I love this movie. I read reviews that say this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in dry cement". I say these reviewers have no imagination! For those who love Fantasy Fiction, this film is for you. If you've ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you, (especially if you joined Oriental Adventures). I'm just sorry I didn't see this movie on the big screen. (Only more incentive to get my big screen t.v. :-)
