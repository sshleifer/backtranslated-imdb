I think the team behind this film did a great job with the limits they had. only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit everything I think is a result in itself. although this film is not for the masses (when an innocent young teenager is killed and there is a homoerotic involved in the story) I think this film is a heartbreaking tragedy and more deeply involved in history, more sadness than you feel. more so towards Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned. <br /> <br /> this is one of my favorite English movies that I liked a lot and would watch again. I think it's a shame that the film is not very well known.
