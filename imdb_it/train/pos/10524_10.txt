Jane Austen would surely approve of this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a fantastic job capturing Emma's attitude. It's fun without being overly foolish, but elegant. He puts on a very convincing British accent (not being British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but he deceived me ... it was also excellent in "Sliding Doors" ... Sometimes I forget it's American ~!) . <br /> <br /> Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) like the Bates women. They almost steal the show ... and Mrs Law doesn't even have lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
