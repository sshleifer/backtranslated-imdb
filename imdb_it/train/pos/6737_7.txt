The director and the two stars of LAURA (1944) were retreaded for this solid policier: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a policeman to cut all ties with the past but cannot control his violent inherited ways while he questions suspicions and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is his victim's estranged wife, a decorated war hero who was involved with the head of the city's racket and Andrews' number one nemesis, Gary Merrill (who was Andrews Snr's protege)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-made film with a sequence of remarkable opening titles and animated by a benevolent cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews' superior superior), Tom Tully (as the father of Tierney's taxi driver ). Neville Brand (as Merrill's main thug), with considerable support also from Craig Stevens (like the slimy victim victim of his wife), Bert Freed (as Andrews 'sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' outgoing severe superior) . Having already been warned by the latter to repair his ways, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours after his murder to put the police on (in this case) Merrill's wrong tracks; however, after Tully becomes the main suspect (when Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the policeman goes alone to Merrill's lair with the intent of getting himself escaped and "framing" the Camorrist for his own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews faces the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is generally complemented by the style of internal Fox noir.
