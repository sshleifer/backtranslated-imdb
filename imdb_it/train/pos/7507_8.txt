Greetings still from the darkness. Mary Heron is accumulating enough the list of films that provide a look into their specific era. His previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when they commented on the oddity of the company at the time. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously on Ms. Page, it is a veritable apex behind the scenes of the bizarre world in the 50s. <br /> <br /> The film is fun to watch both in terms of history and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The film and the grainy photos of B & W capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh from Edward R Role of Murrow), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The protagonist of the film is Gretchen Mol, extraordinarily talented, undervalued and submissive. Ms. Mol always brings an advantage and a spirit in her roles. He was absolutely mesmerizing in the unseen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the infamous Bettie Page. His smile is captivating and his body is impeccable. She really seems to appreciate this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee can become the queen of the Pin-ups of the underworld. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, the soundtrack of the era is exceptional. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the leading artists. Although the film suggests providing a story in this area, the final third type falls flat, avoiding the magic of pure film. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes this movie fun to watch and one that will produce unlimited shows on HBO in the near future. Will anyone please turn Mrs. Mol into the star she should be?
