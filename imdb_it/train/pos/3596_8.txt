In the end I sat down and saw this movie all the time, and I have to say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses --- it's not just the fact that * she can * act, but that she chooses the roles that are most suitable for her that are more significant and important than it would seem before. I have read some comments expressing their relief that it was not a terrible feminist thing as they had previously thought, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself as opposed to what practically everyone around her think (except for her considerate brother Tiny and her trainer and manager, Hector, who proves more of a father figure than her real parent ), which is what the word "feminism" is all about. It's nice to see films like this that showcase the real side of feminism - which is not a bunch of nerds - but who have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true to herself as she continues to fall prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complicated relationship than something they magically solve. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and puts some trust in my perception of people. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that is not only for young women, but for all those who want to go far in their lives.
