I saw this movie for the first time on some movie channels (HBO?) A while ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other previous raps and saw CB4 in theaters. However, the promo caught my eye and I wanted to see what it was. Well, I immediately knew it would be good (ATTENTION!) And I was right. The only songs of parody make this film worthy of being seen again and again (My Peanuts), but the general flow and delivery of the film were fantastic. You must love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching his ass? Too bad this film didn't get the merit it deserved, since it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion it's a much better film. If you know and love the gangster rap of the 90s, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you don't like it or don't like rap, you'll have fun with jokes at the expense of the genre.
