I read many negative reviews of this film and finally got the chance to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really don't know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> It is a mysterious yellow murder, shown from various points of view, by an eccentric cast of potential murderers / suspects addicts, including the late king of porn, John Holmes. Please read the synopsis of the plot for the exact details of the movie plot - I would like to contribute more to a review than a synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have gone so far to give this film the lowest score due to violence but I really don't see it. MANY modern films were worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this film, which often relies on implicit blood stains of real brutal killings (after all, the murders depicted in this film were made with lead pipes). <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by both parts of the film - the first showed John Holmes as a drug addict with no hope of cash, and the second part showed his part as a small conspirator in a senseless bloodbath . The film has excellent acting, though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a little out of place in his motorcycle personality and bad-boy personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also fantastic - a fantastic mix of 70's rock b-side and dark pop, distributed over a couple of hours in all the right places for Boogie Nights.
