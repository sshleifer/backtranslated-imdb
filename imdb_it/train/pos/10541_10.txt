I thought it was a fantastic movie. The theme is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me a little was at the beginning, when everything had to be normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the film was very creative. I think all the acting was well done, the actors played the characters' personality perfectly. Everything is fine together. It is really a pity that theirs is not a soundtrack. It would have been great! Because this is a Canadian film, and since it's one of my favorites, I give this movie a 10 out of 10!
