This film revolved completely around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie fantastic ... except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson couldn't do it alone and you know it! LOL) I admit I killed my first videotape of this movie and I'm going to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This film has so many eye-catching lines that it is pitiful! I'm embarrassed to say that I know the theme of the song backwards and forwards! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch until his death, and he should have won the award for best supporting actor in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were NEVER ready for it! This is a random movie made up of crooked cops, breasts, chases, bad montages and of course martial arts. (Being that it is the 70s and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the middle of a marathon in local theaters!
