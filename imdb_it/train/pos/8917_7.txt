A meteor falls into the village of a small town, carrying a gelatinous creature. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treats the bladder and asks Steve to investigate where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the blob that kills the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the inhabitants, but nobody believes it, while the blob swallows many people, becoming bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cult and a classic sci-fi. It's a low-cost movie, with many actors and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but also delicious and very, very funny. This is the first time I see this classic (I had seen the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to Steve McQueen's fans and 1950's sci-fi movies. The film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
