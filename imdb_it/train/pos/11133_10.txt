Even though I love this movie, I can barely watch it, it's so real. So, I put it up tonight and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered it vividly, but I just wanted to see if I could find something I had never seen before ........ I didn't do it: it's because it's so real for me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote the age of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that! It is absolutely obvious that most of these people who commented on "Midnight Cowboy" were not born when it was released. They are mentioning other films in which Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared at a later date. I'll be just as ruinously frank: I'm 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, you will know that I was a professional female impersonator for 60 of those years, and I also appeared in the film - you would never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my nighttime character club. Do you think he knows a lot about the characters in this movie? CLIPS THAT I DO !! .... <br /> <br /> .... and I'm not a little ashamed. If you haven't come across any of these, it's your loss, but there's a great chance you have, but I didn't know. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters may surprise you. It shouldn't be a secret MANY actors / actresses have emerged from the "Midnight Cowboy" environments. Who should judge? I can name several current BIG-TIME stars who were raised in the squalid streets of many cities and were not in the least damaged by their time there. I have no judgment, because these are human, just like all of us - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you give the name to the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package is. <br /> <br /> The "curiosity" about Hoffman who actually begs on the streets to prove he could play the role of "Ratzo" is a gem - he can be seen driving his car around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his contribution? I can also name a lot of male characters who stopped on the streets and went around the bar for money. Even though the nightclub where I worked for 26 years was world-famous and legitimate, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly driven off our back-street, trying to make a pick-up. <br /> <br /> This should come as no surprise today, although it is definitely an action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different shade. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" thought that "Joe Buck" had been molested by his grandmother. Even though I saw him in his bed with a boyfriend, I found no incidence. Believe it or not, children have ALWAYS not had their rooms - because what is needed today should tell you that something like perversity could happen in the master bedroom. Whose business are they? Hoffman may have begged for change in the streets, but some of the "users" point out that Jon Voight was not one of the main stars for the filming of "Midnight Cowboy" - his actual salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that he made him a star for such a great job as "Deliverance". He called a powerful man who had conquered his devils and was the best: few people commented that he had been sodomized in this film. The late 1960s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but the company has always been fashionable. <br /> <br /> I also didn't find any homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they were clearly opposite, unattractive to each other. They found a purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, you lost time. The "loss of Joe", but the shameless devotion was evident. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role, which John Wayne could never get, and he was handsome when he was young. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film has been beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you're wrong. "The party" ? - participate in some of the "rave" that young people attend ..... if you can enter. Look at the lines of people trying to get into hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of the elegant women of society who sometimes have to go to the heart of the matter. If you were shocked by his brilliant acting, thinking "this is not real", look at today's "ladies" who live on the brink of discredit ... and are admired for this. <br /> <br /> the "Joe" brutality shown in robbing the old man, unfortunately, is also part of life. You must not condone it, but it is not too different from any violence. "Joe" sharply called his purpose: in that situation, I would deliver the money faster than he asked. This is one of the scenes that makes this film a success, one I don't watch. My heart is broken for both of them ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this deafness to direct this wonderful aprotondo - Waldo Salt didn't write from clairvoyance. Anyone who has had a share of bringing it to the screen must have understood that they were making history, and should be proud of honesty. Perhaps "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not scruple in presenting it to the public. Not looking doesn't mean it's not there - give me the truth every time. Good boy! to all ......
