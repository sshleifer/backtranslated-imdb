My brothers and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local broadcaster aired it a summer in the 1970s. We absolutely adored him. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual American replicas (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... we get the idea). He had a similar feeling to The Avengers (no surprise, since he was also English and in the spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it again now - hopefully it holds up. I mentioned this show to others and no one ever heard of it, so I started wondering if I had imagined his entire existence. But the wonder that is the web has allowed me to trace the information on it. I hope he will find a new generation of fans.
