I saw this film for the first time at a festival. There were many good films, but few made me think long, and An Insomniac's Nightmare was certainly one of them. Tess is certainly a talented filmmaker. The shots were fantastic. The casting was perfect. Dominic shone in his role that he perfectly achieved. There was not much to know about his character, but he wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. And Ellen-- I can't wait to see where she ends up! He's showing a lot of talent and I hope he makes some more films. With all the million-dollar budgets trying to get an economic thrill, Tess shows that it's not necessary all the time for a good story and actors. Congratulations to everyone involved in this film. And thanks to Tess and co. to distribute it on DVD!
