I just came back from the first screening of Basic Instinct 2. I was thinking it would be disgusting based on the critics of the preview and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original basic instinct, I think you will like the n. 2, if not more. A great story that always makes you think and think. The music is superb, taking up the original theme. Don't wait for the Academy Award material, go see it for fun and fun. This is what movies are designed for - escape. I can't think of a better way to escape than to run away with Sharon Stone who is as sexy as she has ever been. I'm thinking of going to see him again this weekend. Go see it!
