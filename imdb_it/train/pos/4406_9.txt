Strangely, this film never made it to the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video to come out. My expectations were high but they were not disappointed at all. As always with Ang Lee there is a fantastic acting, an intelligent and electrifying plot that has guessed right up to the end and superb shooting. Together with Unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90s. <br /> <br /> People who expect something on the Mel Gibson line in The Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, everyone else who appreciates the qualities mentioned above will have a great time watching it. 9 out of 10.
