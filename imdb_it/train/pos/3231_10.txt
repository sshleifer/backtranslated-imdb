The soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hates him has many good reasons. But I really liked Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First of all, the art direction is tight and well executed. As for science fiction backgrounds, Soldier was doing things with more design than 90% of the genre. The sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; I didn't love all their future military style, but I was struck by the effort. For me, this made the film worth the time it took to watch. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films. The soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award winning role, but Kurt faces convincing emotions with VERY little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This is not iron monkey, or even matrix, but once again far exceeds the average quality level of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, and you like science fiction action movies, withdraw it if you step into your rental deposit of your choice. Don't expect the next Bladerunner.
