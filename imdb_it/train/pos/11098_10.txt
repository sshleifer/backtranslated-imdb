Brendan Filone is the best character in The Sopranos. he died shooting his eyes. This was the best and well orchestrated scene of the Sopranos. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Philo will persecute Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior will not make it anymore. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode # 3, Denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy will live on forever. Brendan Filone is the best character in Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character ever. I recommend this show to all those who love Drama and want to see scenes of death and direction and production, because there is nothing better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
