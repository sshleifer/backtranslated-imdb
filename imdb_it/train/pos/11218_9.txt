This anime is a must for Evangelion fans. This is a previous work by Anno Hideaki, but his unbridled dramatic style is quite rooted. Moreover, those who did not like Evangelion could find this version slightly more palatable. Gunbuster is quite unique for science fiction souls as it is based on true science. In fact, the show has several small "science lessons" that explain the physics behind some of the film's events. One of the great dramatic points of the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to that of light. The series does an excellent job of managing the traumatic experience of leaving the earth on a six-month mission that travels near the speed of light and returns to a land where ten years have passed. The main character remains 17 or 18 years throughout the series while almost all the other characters age considerably. Be careful, this show is heavy on the sap sometimes. He also has a couple of the most completely undeserved breast strokes I've ever seen. I found it quite easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is still very good, but viewers with low lymph tolerance may wish to stay away from it. An interesting note, Gainax, as always, has managed to remain without money in the last two episodes. However, they managed to use black and white film and action sketches to still produce a good resolution. The ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut that I couldn't help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of souls in circulation.
