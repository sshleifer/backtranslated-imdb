This is a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! A splendid time is guaranteed for everyone. The public (for some celebrities like Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is, as always, quite surprising: from small children to old supporters of the Sixties. They know by heart the words of all the songs, and some of them cry when Paul breaks into "merlo" "yesterday" "all my love" and all the treasures of his catalog (which, except for John Lennon and Dylan, can boast a such repertoire?). There are two particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> - The double tribute to Lennon and Harrison: first "here today" performed as a soloist (the title was included in the "tug of war") 1982 and it was his best track), then "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - "The long and winding road", a key moment, when Paul's voice cracks, as he is moved to tears from the heart the tour group members hold in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember, in the early seventies, when people used to despise Paul because he wasn't involved in politics, like his ex-partner. They had to change their mind because Paul is a committed artist: "fame is great because it allows charity". The film shows different aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is anything but selfish.
