I disagree with anyone who could dismiss this film as "just" entertainment. Set just after the carefree and roaring years, during the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is at the center of a fervent tale of admonitions, with a clear message on how best to endure these difficult times. Yet this fast-paced, tightly-knit film is far from being a sad tale of morality. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Hollywood had a talent for turning out an audience that enjoyed themselves * and * illuminating the audience after audience, all without wasting a movie frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the * four * films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 - is just 80 minutes long, but his characters are well developed, his story never seems rushed, and despite his many twists , the public is never left behind. <br /> <br /> With the sole exception of Lester Vail as floppid love love Bob Townsend, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Noteworthy are William Bakewell in the role of Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (better known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket) as journalist Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in a leading role as gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's film, and it absolutely shines. Made when he was only 27, this less-known version of Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with his later work. However, here is proof that, long before taking an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the truest sense of the word, a formidable actress with the charisma of bringing a photo on her own. <br /> <br /> Score: EIGHT on TEN
