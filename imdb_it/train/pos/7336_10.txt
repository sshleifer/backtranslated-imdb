This is another Ralph Bakshi favorite fantasy; after watching it on YouTube that is. Set in the distant past after the ice age, it is a prehistoric quest for sword and witchcraft between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the kingdom of Ice and his mother, Queen Juliana, has set his sights on conquering the known world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the sub-human servants of Nekron and Juliana capture Princess Teegra, the faint daughter of King Jarol of Firekeep; but manages to escape and eventually meets Larn, who promises to escort her to Firekeep; if the sub-humans do not find them first. <br /> <br /> This film had a very small box office (like most Ralph Bakshi films), but it became a cult classic, partly due to the quality of the film art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also, I heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who had made Conan comic stories, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; although I must admit that I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his works of art for figurines, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company as well as paintings. And like Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings and American Pop films, this film has been rotoscopied, but the process works better in this film than the previous one. <br /> <br /> So overall, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy films ever made and an incredible collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With a lot of imagination, sexual allusions and thrilling adventures.
