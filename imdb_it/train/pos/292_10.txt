Ok, first of all I took this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE! FIRST - This film had to be in stereoscopic 3D. It's mostly, but every time the main character is in his car, the film falls flat in 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that hard to shoot in the car !!! SECOND - The plot is not very good. There are many things wrong. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Because they are showing all the deaths at the beginning of the movie! He had the movie sucked every time someone was going to be killed !!! Watch it for a good laugh, but don't waste your time buying it. Just download it or something cheap.
