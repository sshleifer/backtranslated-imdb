A wonderful and raw war film that focuses on the inner torment of Al Schmid. Although hard and unpleasant, he is ultimately a hero: Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was superb. But a bone to choose. No matter how many .50 bullets were fired, I never saw the water or dirt hit by the bumps! It hurts realism, but I can live with it. Beautiful performance by Eleanor Parker, once again, as her friend.
