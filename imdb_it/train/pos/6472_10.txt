One of the most beautiful pieces of television drama of the last decade. During the five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly tested as they explore many aspects of modern British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first it looks like a heavy hand of copper in conflict with the heroine, but then it proves to be intelligent and caring, while working with her to discover the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe you come from the world of television knowledge. His performance was magnificent, as he maintained his humor and composure while trying to balance the needs of the case and the stress of caring for his mother. I could go on and talk about all the cast members who contribute to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such a compelling script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. These are programs like this that restore confidence in television drama, while at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that increasingly fills up radio waves.
