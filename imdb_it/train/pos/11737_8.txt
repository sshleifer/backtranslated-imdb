OK, this movie is stupid. I say this in a positive sense. It was stupid on purpose, and it was one of the best "stupid" movies I've seen. The jokes and the gags are intentionally bad, but delivered in a way that hit all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were rather superficial and mediocre. There is a rather weak plot, but it works well. <br /> <br /> The character of Elvira is the fulcrum here. It is adorable and adorable. Cassandra Petersen has a acting talent that only shines in this film. on top of that acting talent, he had physical attributes that were frankly amazing. Few men might disagree. The parts that show his figure are also some of the funniest scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a smile from ear to ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> recommended for comedy fans and fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen other Elvia movies.
