Among the elements that make this the best at this point, I must say that the first is Christine McIntire. The scene of Shemp when she is poisoned and her reaction is truly magnificent. I imagine that, as suggested by a poster, Christine was trying to hold back the laughter during that scene, but in reality it made her look even more delightfully evil, to smile with Shemp perhaps by dying. <br /> <br /> Another character that helps you stand out is the Goon. His appearance was a great cross between horrible and comic trinkets. Hardly a character that I would have chosen to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter, anywhere. I would have preferred some real whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is good, who will complain. Not me
