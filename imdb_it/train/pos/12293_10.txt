This is an excellent film, and is a kind of treasure that can only be captured through sporadic cinematographic representations, since it is not available on video / DVD. The way the movie starts with the two lovers coming in, and ends with them at the start (although very often it happens in the middle, and they don't stay in one place during this period), it gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling everything is right with the world. If you have the chance to watch this movie, then do it. I look forward to seeing it again, and I wish it could be published in general.
