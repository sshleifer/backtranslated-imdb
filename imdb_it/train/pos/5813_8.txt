This movie is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, I really like my films about plot and dialogue, but from time to time, something like Moonwalker arrives, and it's watchable, despite its many flaws. /> <br /> This movie is nothing more than a very funny announcement by Michael Jackson. Starting with a sick video on "Man in the Mirror", a montage that lists his accomplishments, and the highlights of his career, through all the highlights of his life, and then falls into a really fun segment that serves as a music video fun for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following the adventures of MJ as he runs from a manic-stop motion fan, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. Stop motion is not as bad as some would have us believe. It is passable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the excellent video of "Leave me in peace" and directly in the main function. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous. We see Michael coming out of a building, then being hit by thousands of soldiers. Then we hit the flashback, showing MJ and three children who stumbled into an underground den. "Mr Big" (Joe Pesci) is the evil criminal who has a plan to make all the children of the world get hooked on "drugs" (no specifics are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the girl he was captured with, then chased ... yada yada yada. The plot is not the most important part. We have two fantastic sequences in which MJ turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship thing and, of course, the amazing Smooth Criminal sequence. <br /> <br /> It's such a film, but it's great for those who love MJ. It has most of its greatest successes, and some interesting little pieces, and some pretty good special effects (the Robot / Spaceship sequence in particular) It's worth it, especially since you can get it for about a quid on eBay. He will keep the children quiet for a couple of hours, as will most of the 20 boys who were children when he was released.
