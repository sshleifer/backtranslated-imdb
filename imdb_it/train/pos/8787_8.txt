This film has improved my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is obviously better known for his savoir-faire and equipment (to launch a couple of high-sounding European terms!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (albeit slightly) as an actor, while playing an impassive social climber with a great ego and a sense of courage to match. The supporting cast is excellent; all seem well chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> History moves quickly and, although not particularly profound (it lacks, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to make a social comment on the distribution of income enormously unequal during that period), certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also reasonably true to the story. I also really liked the great depictions of 1880 in San Francisco. All in all, there is little to appreciate in this film ... it's really worth seeing.
