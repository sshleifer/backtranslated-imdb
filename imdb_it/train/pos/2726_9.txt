This film is up there with the classics of all time. Music, camera shooting and acting are excellent. Showing the film in black and white looked much better and completed the music perfectly, like Psycho. It's surprising how so few people have commented on this film. My hypothesis is that it is a difficult film to find. I gave the movie a 9. See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
