THERE ONCE, there were different types of films. These different films co-existed even though each had something different to offer .... <br /> <br /> This seems obvious at first, but I thought I'd mention it during this review because it seems some people may have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all. It does not pretend to be anything else or something grander. People who laugh at it as something that does not live up to a promise are not seeing the whole picture - literally. After all, Hollywood makes films all the time that they are shameless vehicles for people (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife w / Whitney Houston are two examples that come to mind.) <br /> <br /> First of all I would like to address the film problem as vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria and then with Matinatta di Leoncavallo. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but he also sings popular music like "I left my heart in San Francisco" and the song that was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe, "If we were in love" w / music by John Williams and texts by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It was designed for Pavarotti, so obviously it won't be something deeply or universally applicable to the normal spectator of a film. It is the story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing in the same place, the "MET" in New York, he loses his voice from fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold- gives him a chance to cure his psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the chance to have an adventure with him and reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> They embark on a relationship, she knows she is married and promises not to fall in love with him and he thinks she will be just another woman. Despite everything, they fall in love (so the song, "IF we were in love") and with his help, overcomes his fear and returns to the MET where he triumphed. I won't say how it ends, but it's quite predictable. Which is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The performance in this is not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you expect a performance by Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you're disappointed, not Pavarotti. He knows he's not an actor. What it is is cute, charming and charismatic. He's having fun on his own, and if you can even let yourself be entertained, it's not so bad. A funny joke is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Fini can get you wet!" and, of course, she says, "I don't want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job as a semi-tense woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the film is: "Life must never be life-size". And there's Eddie Albert who does his usual good job as Fini's manager. There are many "themselves" cameos from real directors, singers, etc. And it was shot on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let yourself go and enjoy a "little adventure" just like he proposes in the movie, then you can enjoy this movie for what it is. I know I do it - EVERY time. :) <br /> <br />
