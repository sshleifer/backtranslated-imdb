If Dick Tracy was in black and white, the Pope would not be religious. By giving a new meaning to the concept of color in a film, we are offered a unique experience in a comic book world, and it is one of the few films that have succeeded, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances (Al Pacino it's surprising) and above all a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume designer. Using only the primary colors, the experience is very different from everything we've seen before. And there is also a successful tribute to the whole genre of the gangster film, practically extinct by modern cinema. Overall, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality for a cinema that increasingly relies on old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10.
