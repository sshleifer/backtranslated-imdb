Part of the pleasure I took from this film stemmed from the fact that I knew nothing more than what John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch), was a piece of the period and concerned chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. I will therefore not give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em accompanies him step by step like the strong-minded woman who is attracted to him. It's about love and obsession, rather than the revered board game and after attracting me gradually during the first half hour, I became totally thrilling. And I challenge anyone to guess the ending.
