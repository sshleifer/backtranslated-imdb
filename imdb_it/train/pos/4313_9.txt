The Grand Canyon falls into a very poor category: it is a very intelligent film, with very intelligent dialogues and food for thought everywhere from beginning to end. I have the impression that he has never reached his deserved ranking (and never will), due to its simplicity. This type of flick requires sensitive observers. Too bad IMDb makes me write ten lines, because this is not absolutely necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to satisfy this request, I'll tell you that the weak point of the film, if present, is in acting: not that it's bad, but it could have been done much better. Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
