I just saw this movie and I'm in love with it. There's a little something for everyone, and it's a free detail for everyone when it comes to the love story between Lachlan and Lil. When I'm on the beach, I almost cried ... there is the tacit awareness that time is the most precious asset and it is most evident when they are together. This idea was taken from different points of view, from marriage to siblings to find love in less conventional places. The film makes you almost want that kind of despair when you know that tomorrow could be your last. Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I always had a weakness for the accent, but I almost melted with his portrait of his character. Even the way this film was shot is beautiful, with the music, the background of the open fields and the superb acting. All together, this is a wonderful film that picks up all human emotions.
