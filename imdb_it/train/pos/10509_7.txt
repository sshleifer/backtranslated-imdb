I haven't read the novel, although I understand that this is somehow different from it; the fact that I liked this, combined with the fact that this is not my thing, leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I cannot really compare it to any of his works. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue in this is intelligent, witty and well-stocked, as well as the greatest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh very hard, with perfect English and verbal material. Each performance is apt, and Paltrow has completely captured the role of a matchmaker. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. I found a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think at least part of it was fun, it tended to repeat itself excessively, and honestly it wasn't funny the first time they appeared. Editing and cinematography are wonderful and everything looks absolutely stunning. The plot and the rhythm are fantastic, you're never bored. It ends in a * really * obvious way, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I cannot say that this did not entertain me, he did it from beginning to end, and I would look at it again. There is a short language in this. I recommend it to all fans of love stories. 7/10
