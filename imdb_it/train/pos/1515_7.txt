Amicus has approached a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 1970s, and this, from the famous horror scribe Robert Bloch, is one of their best efforts. There are four stories, all worthy, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method For Murder" - stand out as very effective trips in fear. <br /> <br /> In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) resents her negligence and her brutal intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her disgust for his methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of wicked mischief and offers one of the greatest shows for children in a horror film since Martin Stephens in "The Innocents". This episode is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, which occurs outside the field, is a moment of pure horror. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" is about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his creations, the creepy Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and its terror. Dominic may or may not be true, so director Peter Duffell really enjoys playing with our expectations. Dominic's short strokes reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantom in a meadow are really haunting. <br /> <br /> The original poster art, with a skeletal figure holding a tray with the severed head of Peter Cushing, was a rich enticement for players focused on fear.
