Almost 30 years later, I remember this original PBS film as almost unbearable. Periodically, check out IMDb hoping that someone had the good sense to buy the rights and put it on a DVD. It's September 2004, and I keep hoping - a deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors undertook a small career mainly in an evening soap in the early evening; the other, Frances Lee McCain, has been seen in small roles here and there for some years. But none of what they did before or after was combined with this little film that was produced, as I remember, in a short-lived PBS series that showed the original scripts of the new emerging playwrights. <br /> <br /> I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. This was before the VCR era, so I have no record of it, except in the eyes of my mind. <br /> 31/12/2006 In addition to the above: Happy New Year, sir! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that DVDs are burned from the author's personal copy.
