The Wooden Horse was one of the first "great" escape stories of World War II, which told the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie, but I was on Amazon's VHS in England and transferred from the PAL format to the United States. I read the book when I was at school, after watching a part of the film in the early 60s on TV. The provocative drama of Peter and John escaping from Germany during the war is more realistic than the troll of escapes portrayed in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure, which should be made more available to the American public.
