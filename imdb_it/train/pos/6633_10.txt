The first film ever made. Workers streamed from a factory, some on bicycles, more on foot, moving to the right or left. Together with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the starting point for the cinema - with Melies begins the narrative narrative, the cinema, the fantasy, the artifice, the show; with the pure, no-frills observation of Lumieres. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter to the tired formulas of the first. <br /> <br /> But consider it short again. There is nothing "objective" about it. The film is full of action: a static and inhuman scene explodes in life, in activity, and the silent harmony of the frame breaks, decentralized from behind to the right or left (but never, obviously, in front, where the camera is) . Yet the camera remains immobile, contains energy, eventual subversion, subordinates it to its will. Cinema could be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map the world, modify it, limit it, limit it. <br /> <br /> worse is the historical reality of the film. These workers are employed by Lumiere. The masters are spying on their workers, the invisible eye that concerns his faceless servants. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the doors, workers are confined to their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of an invisible and all-seeing authority that traps its servants. A scary film, far too prophetic.
