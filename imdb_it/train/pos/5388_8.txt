I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I couldn't stop looking until it was finished, even though I could guess what would have happened. Farrell was very good at his role, and everyone else did a super job. Some seemed to stretch the limits, but all in all, I loved it !! If you have the chance to see it, please do it! I actually cried in some scenes, but then I think if you were a mom you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was amazed by the idea that they were unmarried mothers, she seemed ahead of her time. I say, LOOK if you can, and don't listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I loved it!
