Steve Carrel proves to be a great guide man in this wonderful, original, fickle breath of fresh air. I literally wet myself, however ingeniously hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basically the title of the film says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old male working in an electronics store. He's a bit of a nerd who loves video games and comics and has the biggest collection. His colleagues working in the shop with him discover that he is a virgin during a sex-filled oral sex game, and then Andy has to go through a rather funny Odyessy of reckless sexual awakenings, but always ruining what leads him to not lose her virginity, but eventually she gets lucky in the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but bring the whole family to see this fantastic romantic comedy for adults. It will make you hook and break from the beginning, and when it is over, you will wish to wear very absorbent undergarments. Only another thing I can say is that Steve Carrel was not recognized as a man who leaves 20 years ago. Surely he will win the best successful male performance in next year's MTV Awards. You can bet your hard-earned money on this, people! <br /> <br /> I Give this a perfect 10!
