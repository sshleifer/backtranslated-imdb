No, there's another one! <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion on I, II and III and because that opinion was biased as we lacked both the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, I will establish the good guys points of "The return of the Jedi" and some corresponding negative points of the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this was overly debated elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular film: - A strong ecological concern - Antimilitarist positions - Fascinating insights about the Jedi Order and the Force - Funny creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A scene killer: near the end, when Vader looks alternately at his son and the Emperor. The flash of lethal bullets was reflected on his Black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke, thus risking his own life! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the INMHO prequel: - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more of superpowers and somersaults, rather than wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of some actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot. Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, so you should read some books on Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO is found mainly in the continuous spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, even if the difficulties. "De mon âme à ton âme", (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
