I have to say, I thought I saw everything. I'm a fan of extremely tired films. This film did not shock me in any way. I passed beyond that point. But it took me to certain emotional places that I didn't know I could go to. I had no idea that I could ever find (ick) the idea of ​​erotic beastialism. Never ever ever. Never. Never. But here it is. He did it. I have to give the director credit. He pulled it out. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes this film is a TOTAL boredom. Let's start with a very explicit video of two horses having sex. After five minutes of this I started wondering if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then an old man in a wheelchair talks to another old man of two who is getting married. Then a nervous guy shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot chick wearing it with a butler (but this is very short). At this point I was cursing the film out loud while trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep about 40 minutes and forced myself to finish the next night. <br /> <br /> Finally we have good things when a girl (who knows who she is, or who is someone in this movie) has a dream of a Victorian-era girl ravaged by a beast in the forest. The scene goes on for quite some time and it is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole thing. It is beautifully filmed, beautifully edited and supplies the goods. They try to finish the plot at the end and it makes sense but it isn't either. Oh good. I highly recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my TV) but in the last 50 minutes I completely redeemed it.
