When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the terrible Red Queen figurine, I felt sure I had a great disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Obviously, an involuntary and unforgivable absurdity that such a complicated epilogue should be rushed to the point of being able to barely read the subtitles, not to mention the ridiculous explanation. Apart from these quibbles, however, the film is a dream. Fabulous women in fabulous dresses in wonderful settings and all constantly in motion and accompanied by a splendid score by Bruno Nicolai. It may not be Morricone, but in these lighter pieces it could also be. Really fun with lots of colors, lots of sensuality, some bloody killings and minimal police interference. Super.
