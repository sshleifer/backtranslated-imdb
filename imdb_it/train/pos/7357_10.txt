OK, where do I start? ... This film has changed my life! The plot was perfect. James Cahill did it all by himself. Initially after a first viewing I was disappointed that I had not seen it on the silver screen. However this was before exploring the many features of the DVD !!!! Oh my god, the Jakes Cahill movie commentary was almost as flawless as his acting. told of the trade secrets used in the film that are only obtained with experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the other actors. The scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite (pornographic) blue movies. I am certainly with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without sequel. <br /> <br /> I am still amazed at every view of the martial arts skills involved, combined only with the sign indicating the location of the library at the school ... and perhaps the type playing a retarded! All in all a timeless classic and the best film released in Europe for years! where my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
