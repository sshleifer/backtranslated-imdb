The King of Masks is a wonderfully told story that places a family gender preference for males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in China in the 1930s during a period of flooding, we meet Wang, an elderly street artist whose talents are magical and capture the fear of all those who assist him. When a famous opera actor sees and then makes friends with Wang, he invites Wang to join their company. However, we learn that Wang's family tradition only allows him to pass on his secrets to a child. Learning that Wang has no children, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, Wang buys an 8-year-old to fulfill his legacy; he taught his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens rare and dying art. <br /> <br /> Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that inevitably accompany it. The story is engaging. The setting is serene and the simplicity of the costumes. In summary, it is an art film that won an international award that cannot help but move and inspire.
