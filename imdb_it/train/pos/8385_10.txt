This film seems to have bad criticism for some reason. Probably only from the mass population. However, this is actually a very interesting film. The film is a science fiction film under budget that really works, due to an interesting plot and well-made scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be suitable for everyone. If there are science fiction fans reading this, I highly recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The setting includes countries that go to war with GIGANTIC machines, where entire countries invest all their money! The world has been divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else in a war, or rather a "robotic duel". The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, as now everyone is wearing these wind masks. Definitely a movie that makes you think. The good, smart and well written for the poor budget. <br /> <br /> I like movies that have limited budgets and really work.
