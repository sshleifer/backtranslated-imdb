I'll give it to you directly ... this movie is fantastic. foreign gay films beat American gay films in acting and quality history so quickly. While so many Indian indie gay movies are grainy, bad sounds, amateur acting, storylines and a surprising lack of nudity or eroticism, high quality foreign gay films have sprung up like this from France. cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. the plot is adult and complex (but not hard to follow for anyone), the acting is intense and professional. both contacts are fantastic, as is the entire cast. the boys are more than good looking and there is a lot of complete frontal nudity. follow the whole year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. all the little nuances of a relationship, the details of falling in love, and the release of love are beautifully executed there. let me want more. check it out!
