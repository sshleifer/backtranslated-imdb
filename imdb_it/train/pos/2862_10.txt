My comment is generally limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This superb series was one of the first to be broadcast in color, and was very influential in persuading Americans to buy a color television, which was about $ 800 in 1959, the equivalent over $ 3000 today. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a show broadcast from a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series started, and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Looking at it now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. First of all, many of the narrative lines involve the Comstock award and the golden age of silver mining, which dates back to 1859. By 1859, weapons and clothes are, for the most part, not authentic. (Haircuts are left out of the discussion). It's basically a nitpick. <br /> <br /> And it would have been impossible for Ben to arrive in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and have accumulated a 100-square-mile ranch in the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem until 1847, and the Gold Rush didn't even begin until two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians are not played by Native American actors. John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s. The Bonanza producers could easily have done it thirty years later. This is a most important hub for me. <br /> <br /> There are other time-line problems. In season 1, Mark Twain appears and is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also fluctuate between 1859 and 1860 (before the civil war) and what was most suitable for a time frame of 1880. There are problems of continuity, again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also a bit daunting that there is so much murder in the first season. Over time, the murder was reduced. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant, which would be hard to believe, given the time line, but give credit to writers to anticipate seismic changes in Nation attitudes since the 1960s . <br /> <br /> Having said that, the acting is good, and I've come to conclude in the last few years that Adam's character was designed better than any other. I don't think Pernell Roberts ever had the credit he deserved. Furthermore, Season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories trace real historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This has been great entertainment for the family, and the series holds up very well with any size.
