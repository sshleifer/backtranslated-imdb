The Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy / romanticism that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is a mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, who rises with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them with their preppy shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail) is Catherine Boyd, grandson of Einstein, who is a competent but not so sure mathematician. Maybe it's because he's surrounded by all that genius. She thinks that if she marries someone with a high IQ. his children will have a high IQ. well, but she doesn't know what she wants. Between the gracious smile of Tim Robbins and that of Meg, this is a refreshing film. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to the asshole James Moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very formal. This is a love of a situation of the first sight type, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Witty lines and subliminal lines! Cinematography is nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With great help from all those brilliant men, Catherine falls in love with Ed, not knowing that he is an automobile mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite Scenes: Ed is doing a multiple-choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein ride a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris free all the research animals! <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: "Don't let your brain interfere with your heart". Ed Walters: "When was the last time you said" Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I don't know." This is a refreshing film, I recommend it. I have the tape and every once in a while I'll watch it again.
