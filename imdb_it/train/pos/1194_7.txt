The film focuses largely on the bullying of Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to endure it. Set in a hunt for the diminishing number of buffaloes, it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless massacres and is full of dramas and remorse for both buffalo and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of the Indians and by his naivety that buffalo herds will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animal after animal, while in another he kills the Indians and then eats the food they cooked on the fire. Under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It is not the most pleasant of the films and is weighed down by the drama it creates, leading to a sad and very appropriate conclusion in a blizzard.
