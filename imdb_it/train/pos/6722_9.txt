Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (from good to great), the personalities (the greatest of life), the structure (chronological, with many references to the culture of surfing in time). What is missing is a more important question of sociological relevance: taking away the traditional American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 70s. We watched 16mm movies at SoCal local high schools. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf movie at night. Often, the narrator was the director himself, reading a script on sheets of paper. Sometimes, a surf band or a proto-punk band would add music. I've never been happier Except for the whistles and screams, seeing 'Riding Giants' took me back in time. <br /> <br /> IT has also strengthened the feeling of living life to the limit, without worrying about money and the social and corporate climbing ladder, not keeping up with the Joneses, going physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - could be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are brave or honest enough with ourselves enough to pursue: living life solely according to our terms. Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see people who are really living their dreams. <br /> <br /> It was this message that really impressed me.
