The Vince Lombardi school has a new principal: the evil Signora Togar (Mary Woronov). You intend to ban rock and roll music all together. He jumps on the head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Even the head of the school's football team (Vincent Van Patten) doesn't seem to be in touch with any girl - he doesn't realize that the pretty Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> An instant midnight movie. This was put into the general version and almost immediately bombed - but as a midnight film it was a great success and continued to play throughout the 1980s. I remember dating more than one when I was in college: it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughed out loud at every joke and generally enjoyed themselves. <br /> <br /> Seeing him now as an adult I can't imagine why I liked him so much. The script is youthful and full of groans that I could not believe to hear. The characters change randomly and the movie jumps everywhere. What saves this are some really fun lines and wonderful interpretations of Soles and Woronov (which is really having fun). Moreover, everyone is full of energy and plays their WAY over the top roles (as they should). As for the Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I like the melody of the title, but the rest of the songs never really captured me. If you are a Ramones fan you could rate higher. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION SPOILER !!!! This is mainly for children (he has a PG rating) who will probably find him foolish but funny. Above all, I think they will appreciate the end when high school breaks out! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for a stupid midnight movie from the 80s, you might like it. Otherwise, stay away from me. I give him a 7.
