This is one of the best films ever made. It is a realistic representation of rural farming life, which has been an important part of American history. The setting is the Wyoming of 1906, where life had not changed much from the previous century. The film keeps your interest without the added Hollywood myths. The whole family can watch this movie and be intrigued by what life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation. With this film, you will escape the present and be a witness to the daily life of 100 years ago. In a beautiful and scenic environment you will see the hard physical work necessary to survive, as well as the constant concerns and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make the difference between success or failure. Watch this movie and experience life as it was in most of our nation's history. This movie deserves your time to see. My only question is: why aren't there more films like this?
