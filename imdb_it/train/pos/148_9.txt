Like his previous film, "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga creates an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more visually refined than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and disturbing images that can be seen. The intensified drama, the intensity and subtlety of violence threaten the melodramatic or farcical, yet they never come into play. In this way, an almost impossible task is achieved: to be so exaggerated and yet so painfully restrained, to be so laden and yet so underestimated, and even the final explosives are virtuoso festivals. Unperturbed, magnificent and very tense ... this film is simply superb!
