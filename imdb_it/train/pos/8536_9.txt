I recently had the chance to see "The Waterdance", and I really enjoyed it. I really don't understand why it's called that because there's really no dance there, except maybe for the strip club dance near the end. We are introduced to the main characters of the whole film, disabled in a hospital. The story shows a love story between a physically qualified boy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, today there are no such films. I'm not "stuck in a time warp", I'm not saying that everything during the 1980s and early 1990s was better than today, but I really think the film industry is deteriorating and there is a lot to learn from old movies - from old movies I mean anything from 1920-1998.
