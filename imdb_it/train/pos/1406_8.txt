Remember "The invisible man" by H.G. Wells? Well, here's another movie like this, only more extreme. "Hollow Man" is not like an invisibility story as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. At first, making the serum was the easy part, not making the person come back. Most early attempts were unstable. Until one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when it arrived, it was a close one. So when Caine did, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he got tired of not being seen, the team did its best to bring him back to the world of meat. However, the formula of visibility does not seem to work as it should, and Caine will go into madness. So he ends up being a crazy invisible killer. It would be better to leave the city instead of taking the lives of the people who are close to you. I would care less about those you did wrong. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
