I took the film without a cover and I didn't even know what it was, but when I saw it I laughed so hard. Now it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the boys have created a masterpiece that I highly recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for giving us something to laugh about.
