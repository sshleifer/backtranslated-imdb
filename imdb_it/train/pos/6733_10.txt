There has been a wave of recent surf films that I seem to run haphazardly without warning. I captured this treasure with the digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise! The focus is on the Big Wave surf pioneers of the 1960s from Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Damn, I could watch a film about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation - so the rest is just a salsa. There is a lot of good mixed navigation with interviews of past and present surf stars, in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious way. Of all the surf films I've seen, it tells the story of the big wave at its best, and I think it's my favorite. To enjoy!
