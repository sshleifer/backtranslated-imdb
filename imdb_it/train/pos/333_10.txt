In all honesty, this series is as much a classic (as is television) as the original poem is for world literature. Far from being crassly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful rendition of one of the texts that define Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the situation of Ulysses and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was heard but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It must be said that the deities that appear here are not ridiculous creatures of the CGI that run on their ankle wings, or poorly thrown into bikini models. As in Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by statuary classical). <br /> <br /> Too bad it's not available on DVD, especially given the largely inferior Odyssey adaptations and those that can be found in video stores.
