It worked for 8 seasons, but it is the first, at the beginning of 1959, and it is the last, in the autumn of 1965, to be shorter than the seasons 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled the production of Rawhide after seeing the first show of season 8, in September 1965, because he didn't like the series without Eric Fleming in the role of Gil Favor, who had left after season 7. L the last new episode was broadcast in November 1965. The 1966 solitary CBS broadcast, on January 4, 1966, was a reply. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered why Rawhide didn't change color shots for last season? Most of the great westerns of the 60s had gone into color in 1965. CBS broadcast in color that fall, for many of its sitcoms, but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western series (and the last series of prime-time networks to switch to color) on September 17, 1966, for the episode Snap Decision.
