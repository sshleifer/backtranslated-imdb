This film was like any Jimmy Stewart film, witty, charming and very funny. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who wants to be human, is splendid, her subtle facial expressions, her every move and every gesture create the uniqueness and a bit of Gillian, a disturbing character, left us hanging on to every his word. I should not fail to mention the laudable interpretations of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester as the scotch-loving writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and by the latter as the lovable aunt who can It seems that they stop using magic even when it is prohibited. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are wonderfully done and the harmony between them is great, but then again when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and one of the best ladies is bad!
