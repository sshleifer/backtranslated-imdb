I hate very long talkative French films, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most talkative French movie of them all. I saw him twice in the mid-70s, and then he disappeared. But in the end I could see it again in 1999, and I fell in love again. What is most remarkable is that it looks as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. If you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
