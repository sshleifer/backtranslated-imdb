With a minimum budget, an eight-minute run time and a great deal of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has reached one of the most moving short films I've ever seen. The subtlety of the script is truly remarkable, since it does not end the finale until the last moment. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you what it is, since you will be able to enjoy it much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and acting in this formidable short film is the most remarkable effort I've ever seen in recent years. Pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
