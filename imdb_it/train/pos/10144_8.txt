But the fun is in the journey. <br /> <br /> I found this film extremely enjoyable, not only are both extremely easy on the eyes, the supportive cast humor and the jokes made me laugh hard several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a romantic cliche comedy. But the point is that it is a sweet story, the message on how to find your one true love also sounds true in many ways. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is uninterrupted and acting is well done on all sides, and over the top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress deserves an honorable mention! For those who cut it short to be predictable - If you want a movie with twists that make you guess ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it was worth every effort along the way. <br /> <br /> Big date movie, great movie for a happy cry ...
