Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I liked a little more about Bug's Life. I can't remember a Pixar animation, apart from the two Toy Story movies, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and not preaching. The voiceovers are what make this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant who gets very into trouble. Hopper is a superb characterization of the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as well as Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also exceptional support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even moving. The social message of Antz is missing, but what we have is rock solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
