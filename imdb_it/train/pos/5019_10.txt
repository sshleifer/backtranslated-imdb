Hi <br /> <br /> my name is Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw this movie: "For the first time", with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Michael and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in Michael's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy this film has not been programmed for many years and I don't know how to find the song. A lot of thanks for those who can help me! I love this movie! It's very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
