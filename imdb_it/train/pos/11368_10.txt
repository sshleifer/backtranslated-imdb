A surprisingly complex and well done study by the serial killer "The First" in the USSR. Set in the days of perestroika, this intense piece is brought to life with performances by Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> The examination of Cicatillo as a murderer is well rounded and suggests some of his behaviors while showing off to the right is a subtlety that is compelling without being explicitly graphic. Not for the faint-hearted, however, as the topic is often disturbing but necessary for the full development of the main participants in this fact-based story. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us with an excellent film in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this great piece. It's in my top 10 to see the list.
