As I said at the beginning, four stars are not enough. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my nearly 17 years of life. For people who don't like it or don't understand it, you don't have to have a real appreciation for art or you may have little attention. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen all his films however, I should say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It's pretty sad to see that films like "The Color Purple" don't get along too well because I think we all desperately need first-class film entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> <br /> Films like this are more than just movies; they are pieces of art that must be appreciated more. <br /> <br /> The idea that she was nominated for 11 Oscars (also as Best Film of the Year) and did not get a trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can sometimes be. Spielberg was not even nominated as best director! He should have enjoyed the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only the films were still so good ...
