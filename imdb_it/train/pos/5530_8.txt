A must see for those who love photography. surprising and breathtaking, it leaves you in mineral. I've seen it twice in a cinema and now on DVD. it holds up well on DVD but on the big screen this was something else. <br /> <br /> I took my two daughters to see it and they loved it, my oldest cried at the end. but she was the one she wanted to see him again tonight when she saw him at the video store. his simple narration of a child's love for nature and in particular of a fox is well told. somehow it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not made up of documentaries. which works very well for children. the fact of not being preached is very important, you have got it into your head. <br /> <br /> But the star of this film is the filmmakers, as they did what they did. incredible simply fantastic.
