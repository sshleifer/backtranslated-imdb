As a disclaimer, I've seen the film 5-6 times over the past 15 years, and I've just seen the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical (however, it contaminated me when I saw the musical :)). I truly believe that Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think his 'Let me dance for you' scene is one of the best parts of the film, an interesting addition to the musical. The dancers and singing in the film are much superior to the musical, as is the cast which is at least 10 times larger (easier to do in the film, of course). Decorations, lighting, dance and singing are also much higher in the film, which should be expected, and was actually delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the film, the new ones are pretty good, and the whole movie only offers something more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decorations. The only negative point of the film are the obvious cuts between the actors talking and the singers dubbed during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dance is impeccable and the final product was more pleasant than the musical
