Besides the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this film is actually better than the book (and the TV miniseries even if it's an easy task, considering the movie director ). The impeccable style of filming, acting and (the number one skill at Kubrick's time) music - make it THE masterpiece of horror. I saw the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and put my hopes up when I got it. I HAVE AWAY YOU !!! It's much better than I ever imagined. Start slow (Kubrick trademark) and have a lot of downtime which increases suspense. The introductory scene is a classic in every respect and I watched it about 20 times only because of the cutting atmosphere that induces the whole film. Even the film does not offer much coolness (it has enough and is not at all lacking in taste) a fashion I hate in the last-minute horror movies. Watch it!
