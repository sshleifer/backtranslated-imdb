Although I was in this movie playing the part of Sheriff Hodges, he still managed to make me jump in different places and believe me I am NOT that easy. You could say that I am biased about the film, and, OK, I am, but I didn't see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and I was extremely satisfied. I'm not a fan of horror movies as such, but I love old "B" movies and Sci Fi black and white movies. This movie will make you "think" that you know when something will happen, so it won't, then it will. It will keep you completely out of balance. I'd suggest watching the film first, then the director's notes and special features. It is so well written, directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that it was a joy to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
