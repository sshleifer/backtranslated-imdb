Although he has one of the traditional "Revenge Price Plots", this film is my favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has that quality that is missing in so many characters from the horror film: sympathy. When you look at him, try for him, feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and cheer him up when he is revenge, even if he scares you a little with his original fury. As the film progresses, his character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover it. And again to cover that. And yet ... your stomach sinks with its soul as it descends along its spiral, like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. Although the history of revenge is ancient, the plot devices themselves are original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in ever more inventive ways. A pity that this is not available for the veiwing house.
