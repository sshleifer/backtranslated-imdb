From the day I saw this movie when it was released in 1981, it was one of my favorites among the first 3. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that 10 will finally be released on DVD / 17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The latest award in this film explains his appeal - "Thanks to the people of Manhattan on whose island it was shot". A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every place (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits who was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the whole ensemble cast has snapped off the screen as it does so, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also the last appearance of Audrey Hepburn (she had a cameo after this film) and her inner beauty filters through the screen. Buy it, make a big bowl of popcorn and curl up with someone you love.
