Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker gather to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream". It was the psychedelic days of England and America, and these kids looked at him: all the thin, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now something 60 years old and can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD disc shows us. I've always been very familiar with Clapton, of course, who was never out of the spotlight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, none of whom I hadn't seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so thin that he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks healthy, fit and his drumming was solid. Bruce looked a little upset, but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to listen to these old songs. This is just an excellent material and it performs as kids who know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized this show for being low-key. I do not agree with this. I have no complaints. The concert played very well. The second song, "Spoonful", was exceptional, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
