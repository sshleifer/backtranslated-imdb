I took this a few weeks ago and love it! It is modern, light but full of real life complexity. Questions and answers, just like the other Eytan Fox films. This is my favorite, along with Jossi and Jagger. This picture is much more universally than the only bubbles in which we live. It is not necessary to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy it - they are not, but the film goes directly to my top ten films. At first it seems pure entertainment but makes you think further. The relationships we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, profound, fatal, like calls. You don't know what's going to happen, and you certainly don't know where this story is going while you look at it the first time. It is worth seeing several times. Fox films include a great bonus material - here a great music video and "making of" (including the explanation of the title, interview with Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the film and the Arabs with doubts about Israeli lifestyles).
