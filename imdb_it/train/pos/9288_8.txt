I found this a surprisingly light touch in a film about 50's culture clashes. John Wayne would certainly not be the first choice as a cultural attache, being diplomatic with his good intentions as an upward race in Harrods. But this time he was left to play a part that was much more passive than his usual bluff character, and he accomplished his task in style. The Duke was a boy who could really behave himself. His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this film. Many of his good intentions have failed. He had authority over anyone, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha of which he was the barbarian. <br /> <br /> The history of American attempts to ingratiate itself with isolationist Japan was one of political intrigues rather than blunt battles or infernal battles. I cannot comment on the accuracy of his research, but the strangeness of oriental culture for Western sensitivity has been well demonstrated. There was a large, carefully choreographed ceremony that involved what looked to this observer as an authentic costume and props. The pieces of the set were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thoughts had been applied to it. <br /> <br /> The love story between Wayne and his geisha added a little more, and prevented the film from becoming just a political effort or flag-wavers. The script was good without being too verbose. There was a great deal of Japanese dialogues, but the long periods of translation did not interfere with the narrative. It was nice to see a lot of real Orientals on set. Regardless of whether they were Japanese, I can't say. But anyway they looked at the part. At least the protagonists were not interpreted by Caucasian cross-dressing, unlike other efforts like "Blood Alley" (yes, I know they were Chinese) "The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness" or even "The King And I". <Br /> <br /> Frankly, I liked it a lot more than all those other movies. The script was better to start with. I never liked the songs on "The King And I" and I wasn't impressed by the anti-communist subtext "Blood Alley". I confess I have never seen this work before and found it very favorably compared to many of the most popular releases of The Duke. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
