This film is the best horror film, bar-none. I love the way Stanley throws women into the lake. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years and it has shocked me. It's a mixture of horror, drama and romance, not so much comedy. His evil but charming appearance captured me at that very moment. That look in his eyes, I'll never forget. There's something in him, I can't describe it.
