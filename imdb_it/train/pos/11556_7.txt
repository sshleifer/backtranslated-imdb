Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and ended their careers together. Remember the best of the Grumpiest of Old Men and the strangest couple that made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most beloved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as "vulgar" as Pryor and Wilder, on the other hand, were the classic comic team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Like the physical comedy and the mix of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous. In the strange pair, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually about yourself as opposed to passing the joke over another. It is not your typical boyish film, it is in a sense a comedy for adults with two old men who oppose two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is quite funny. Although this film is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
