But how can you bear to run a baseball team that can't win. For George Knox, it's not easy. As the film opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) are riding their bicycles around the angels stadium. When they return to their foster mother's home, Roger is surprised to have a visit from his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they will return to being a family, he jokes father "I say when the angels win the division championship". Later, Roger and J.P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When the George Knox crib (Danny Glover) pulls out his pitcher, the pitcher gets angry and starts to fight with him, and soon the team of angels enters the fight that causes Knox to be expelled from the game. That night Roger makes a prayer, because the corners win the championship. When his adoptive mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP go to a basball, Roger sees the real corners coming onto the field and helps the left defender (Matthew McConaughey) make a hold, leaving the manger and the play-by-play man (Jay O Sanders) as he did to that. Roger learns from the chief angel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the corners, because he was the only one praying for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
