This is one of my favorites along with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and the episodes of Agnes Moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen. <br /> <br /> It is an important outlet, since mid-1961, on the long Cold War in which the United States was involved. The beaten urban scene, the bare dialogue of almost hungry characters, their worn-out uniforms and minimal action "says" everything: the absurdity of an ongoing conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that which is sweet and saving on it. <br /> <br /> It is a "fairy tale" because it was made at a time when events occurred differently, such as the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962), it would actually be a reasonable representation of one of the major cities in the United States, ruined and full of a few miserable survivors. I also see it as a "fairy tale" because it is not only a warning story, but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation, and involving two very different lovers.
