It's a road movie, with a killer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated and polite writer, wants to conduct field research on American serial killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), have the money for a tour through the countries of the murder sites, so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses. Who they are with them are a young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two best examples of "poor white junk" that you will never find in the whole cinema. <br /> <br /> In fact, Early and Adele are what make this film so funny, how they chat, make noise, trust, meditate, speculate, drool, and behave differently in ways I haven't seen since replicas of "The Beverly Hillbillies". The first idea of ​​California: "People think faster out there, because of all that hot weather, the cold makes people stupid." That's enough to convince Adele: "I guess this explains why there are so many stupid people around here." To which Early responds with pride: "It certainly does". Soon he continues to teach Adele about California: "You never have to buy fruit, because it's all about trees ... and they don't have speed limits, and I feel that your first month's rent is free, state law." <br /> <br /> But poor Early has some, well, mental problems, which are becoming increasingly evident to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers proceed westward across the United States as they enter the desert to the southwest, with its splendid landscape, "Kalifornia" begins to appear more and more similar to "The Hitcher" (1986), and Early begins to act more and more like John Ryder, the maniac hitchhiker of all, whose terror seemed so unstoppable. <br /> <br /> "Kalifornia", the acting is irregular. Duchovny performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective despite his atrocious sometimes. Michelle Forbes is as great as the avant-garde artist, photographer. But my choice for the best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With his nasal voice and the heavy accent of the South, it is amazing, like the naive, very animated, adorable Adele. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the film takes on a Twilight Zone atmosphere, as our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with an old ruined house full of test dummies. The plot dissolves rather in a disorderly way in useless and absurd violence, a final that was quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, "Kalifornia" is a fun film, thanks to an intelligent concept, a fantastic scenario, especially in the second part, good cinematography, great dialogue, and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis .
