Not many reviews, so I thought I'd add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO FROM OTHER REVIEWS! This was an excellent film. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the very few Indian filmmakers who can really put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave another example of great acting, as well as bhoomika, which was a bit unexpected, but nice to look at. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there was not much fuss about the release. <br /> <br /> Or film / other awards nominations, considering how beautiful the film is. <br /> <br /> Better then Khakee I thought and thought that Khakkee was also a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty long film, but it's worth it and while you watch it, it seems really long. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see the next RKS movie and the next movie AB, Akshay, always seem to do well together ... eg also. Bhoomika has played very well in the film and should do really well if it continues in the same way in the future.
