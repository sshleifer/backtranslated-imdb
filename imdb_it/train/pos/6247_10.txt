The trailers of this film can show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are only rare fragments, chosen to attract the public. Obviously they are showing the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly kicked in the head in their work and in their lives, using the power, which they could have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress the others. And at the lower end of the oppression chain, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A film that brutally shows how difficult Hundstage is to deal with, but having to endure such lives is even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is very similar to Short Cuts, but consists of documentary style episodes, with people like your neighbor, who play just like they are. Without any glitter, and more disturbingly, without any hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because you realize that these people are out there, and there are many, even if our society focuses on good external appearance. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere there must be undeclared domestic violence, hopes must shatter somewhere. I know about these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without funny scenes (some might think that the handicapped woman who repeats the first ten supermarkets is fun, but this really happens) and without melodrama, go and watch this movie. However it will lose when you are concentrating on the subtitles I fear, since the subtitles cannot carry the accentuation.
