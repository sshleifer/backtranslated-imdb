I loved the movie. he magnificently analyzes the small Italian bourgeois society, as the extremists of the 70s renounced all their ideals and reached a happy agreement that they do not want to disturb. For example, the elderly psychoanalyst who is jealous of his son, and does not want to be reminded of his most radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time he wanted to buy the video after watching the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy none of the book stores knew of the film. a great sin. <br /> <br /> The only sex scene, which everyone seems to go on, doesn't hurt the movie.
