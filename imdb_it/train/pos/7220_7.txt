Nothing is more pleasant for me than a tale of fear or suspense that makes you think of how it will all end. And that's exactly what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling game by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE come to do the kind of acrobatics that Caine and Laurence Olivier started in SLEUTH - with the same skill and the greatest number of enigmas that ever existed in that extraordinarily played intelligent. <br /> <br /> But because it aims to scare you, surprise you and make you guess as to the result, it is difficult to write a review on the plot. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you need to know about the film for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is a madly jealous playwright whose last play failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his drama, Caine realizes that passing it as his would solve all his problems and get his reputation. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it's a matter of fun and games for the public as Ira Levin's story unfolds, managing to beat Agatha Christie by the number of twists. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play brilliantly with each other, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the story as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that deserves the drama with humor. <br /> <br /> In summary: it's worth seeing - but not everyone is happy with the ending.
