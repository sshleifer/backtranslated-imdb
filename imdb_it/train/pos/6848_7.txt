A very silly film, which begins with a soft porn sequence, ventures into a farcelike comedy in the art gallery, adds a shock of a discovery in the hotel room, then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is bizarre and surreal (the chronometer scene in particular is exquisitely useless), culminating in a revealing final "twist" that is as obvious as it is unfair to the viewer (see the trivia section to know exactly because it is deliberately unfair). br /> <br /> The film lends itself to being offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals, madmen and the wonderful racial stereotype "Huggie Bear" on the subway - and treats the viewer like an idiot in the final scenes while the characters explain each other endlessly in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film. Although the female background characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Actually, the whole movie is a joy to watch: despite its many, many flaws, the whole package, well, it works.
