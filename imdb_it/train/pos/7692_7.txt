First, I will give my vote for the general series; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I took three for the descent that this series has immediately after the departure of John Amos. Don't get me wrong there were hard episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for a season and came back. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a large sit-com (with dramatic nuances) was presented as a CBS preview. It was first a TV, a show about an African-American family living in Chicago projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of "Maude", it struck once again the right agreement with the spectators. <br /> <br /> Ever since I saw a situation, I've never seen a comedy speak directly of the struggles of the families of the neighborhoods. (Well, there was Fox's "South Central" in 1994 but it was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the last father figure for this family and acted like any father should keep his family together and his children from going wrong ways in life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful senseless mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to educating their children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter in the role of Michael, a young man but very bright for his age, but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. His character's name is the same as the show's founder, Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson in "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 years and has to face the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical wise and disdainful young guy who does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, except for the Penny Narrative Lines by Gordon / Janet Jackson. <br /> <br /> After the demise of the James Evans character, the show lost its stability and the spectators left. Esther Rolle left for a whole year, not wanting to play the second violin with JJ's "Dyno-mite's" smart-aleck! <br /> <br /> It is back next season, after assuring that the writer would also do something. The neighbor of Florida, Wilona Woods, was a divorced woman who ended up adopting an abused girl, Penny Gordon (played by Janet Jackson, who was then 10 years old). Penny's violent mother was played by Totie Fields, the mother of Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August 1979 the show ended, leaving all the plans for a better life. JJ the artist had sold an idea to a comic book company, Michael went to live on campus in college. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma and the husband of football player Keith + Florida all moved into the same building in downtown Chicago. Not the most realistic ending, but at that time it didn't matter.
