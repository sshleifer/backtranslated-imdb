Generally I find Loretta Young difficult, too worried about her appearance and too elegant in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical story by Frank Borzage, and even if he interprets a low self-esteem that takes care of all the bullying of Ambassador Spencer Tracy, it is direct, honest and irresistible. It's a strange little film, played mostly in a one-room hut in a Hooverville, unusually poised on the Depression, but romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a "normal boy" stormy and difficult to take, who would be a terrible chauvinist and bully by today's standards, softens the hard edge of his character and makes it almost enticing. There is a good supporting work by Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got what she should have), and Jo Swerling's script is modest and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who has always loved to dramatize true love in the foreground lyric, and Young. It is as if he wanted to slap her and tell his character to be wise, he is too good for this boy, but he is so dewy and persuasive, observing with satisfaction his own story which ends satisfactorily.
