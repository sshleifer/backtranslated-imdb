I've never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all the new shows in shame, great! Anyone who has never seen it, who can't see how it's possible, should see it. It's a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, make you cry, will amaze you. Sure, some people feel that there are some "cheese" aspects to the show, but, the positive aspects out weigh all the "cheese" aspects. Full House directed her first episode on September 22, 1987 entitled "Our Very First Show" and directed the last episode on May 23, 1995 entitled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The plot of the show is very credible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are called DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse are planning to move with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years; which is the number of years that the show worked. <br /> <br /> The following is a brief description of some characters and the actor / actress who played him: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. Play Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting to get her big break. In Full House, John Stamos does a great job playing his character. He watched and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He has to raise three girls without having the girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job playing a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): A word can describe Dave Coulier, fun. He is fantastic. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the stand-up comedian waiting for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's a fantastic actress. Sounds the big sister, DJ, which is short for Donna Jo. She's one of the best actresses I've ever seen. His acting ability in Full House was very credible. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly amazing! I wish I could say anything I would like to say about Jodie, but, I would like to use the maximum of 1,000 words only on her. He started his career in a children's show entitled Mother Goose Stories and when he arrived at Full House, he blew the minds of the public and the creator. His magnificent appearance and his incredible acting ability have contributed to making the show the success it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie should have been the star of the show. It had to be where he got his big break. Jodie, five years old when the show first aired, managed to hit every line perfectly. He showed great enthusiasm. Most children cannot do this. As you can probably guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they started. They received Michelle's part because they were the only children who didn't cry in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> There are many other cast members who should be recognized. These are the original characters from when the show first aired in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end. I think it was focused on her towards the end. Especially when I think that Jodie and Candice were much better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things you can learn is that everyone can live a wonderful life even if a tragedy occurs, like losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. That being said, there are only a couple of things left to say; Full House will never die, and thanks to the cast of Full House, to give everyone a show they can enjoy.
