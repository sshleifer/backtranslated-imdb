I saw it for the first time at a foreign film festival. It is a nail-nail wonderfully on a plot to alleviate the Estonian treasure of about a billion in gold. Everything is shot in a gritty, gritty style that Hollywood rarely uses - but captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states in a splendid manner (note: Tallin really seemed a lot less sad in 2003 when I was there). > <br /> There is also a lot of humor and a little romance. I don't want to spoil a number of surprising but logical surprises, so I'll just say that this robbery film starts with a great script, and the direction and performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most unnerving example of its kind --- I put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it is many kilometers ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, although (deliberately) not as polished. RENT OR BUY NOW.
