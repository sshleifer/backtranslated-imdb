Greetings still from the darkness. This will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it is not up to that classic, it is extremely fun and well done in its own right. The plot is a bit strange and the whole thing about the wall is never explained, but the execution is good, even if it creates suspense. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to go and get her a shooting star ... which seems to be played by the beautiful Claire Danes. There's not much suspense about what happens with these two, but the most daring part comes with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole trying to reclaim the ruby ​​necklace that our "star " is wearing. A lot of bad pursuits of the good. <br /> <br /> Along the way, a meeting with the strangest pirate you will see (including the Caribbean ones). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard inside, and we should say in touch with his feminine side. Another meeting involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais in the role of a trader who talks fast and is good for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> Not your typical pursuit, age or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Cake") effort is worth an audience. Unfortunately the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent him from making money. I imagine you will find great success on video.
