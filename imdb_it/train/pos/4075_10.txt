Laputa: the castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his most recent works and the purest, most fantastic and in flight pirates could be better! The art is absolutely incredible and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after, (I'm not sure it was the first time I heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any soundtrack of a film . Sheeta, the female protagonist of this film is absolutely fantastic and the boy, Pazu is also a great model - he lives alone! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not give it away, but the end is really great. I rate it as one of Miyazaki's top three with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You could also check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometimes next year I hope) If you like Miyazaki, take a look at this as it is easily available in the United States. Have fun, Piper A
