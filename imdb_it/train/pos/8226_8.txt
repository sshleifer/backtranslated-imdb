We are talking about a low-budget film, and it is understandable that there are weaknesses (no spoilers: a sudden explosives expert and a nonsense alcohol); but in general the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are nice and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise you with some people who are not who they want you to believe and then they turn and turn the plot ... I congratulate you on this. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see also "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) a movie from Argentina.
