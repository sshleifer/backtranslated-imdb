Spielberg's first dramatic film is not disappointing. It is a well made film without flaws on the life of an African American woman. It also shows that not all films that have ethnic Afro-American as the center of the story must be led by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is Spielberg's ability to do is very realistic despite being based on a book. Also, Danny Glover was excellent as a Mr. And usually, he's just himself in most of his films. But in this, it branches out completely and is someone else for once. But the endurance performance of the entire film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. It's excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I have heard that even the musical version of this will be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's as good as this, because this is a movie you can't miss.
