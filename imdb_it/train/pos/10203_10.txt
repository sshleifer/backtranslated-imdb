I love movies and I own comics, comics are different from the movie, but I'd give it anyway: 10 out of 10. It was great. If the films became more fantastic. I would have his children. And I'm female. Read the comics that you won't regret. Yes, in this film by Brian P. the artist died for her, we are not nearly as good at artistic work. I mean seriously, don't get me wrong, these people worked great, but different versions for different people. Different traits for different people, as the saying goes. Any guy who doesn't like her is crazy, or she doesn't like women, or you just know how to cry. If I could count on my fingers as a lover and how many times I read the comics, I would miss my fingers for sure, but hey there are always toes.
