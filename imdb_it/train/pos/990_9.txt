I really enjoyed this movie. Obviously the idea is practically out there ... the federal government is organizing a tracking device implanted in the jaw of a small thief to attract a more dangerous thief / hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man with whom the feds volunteered to be implanted with the device, is a very nice person and he finds himself very amused to stand in his head for a while. Finally Alvin proves to be much more than a character in a good mood but passive or one-dimensional when he proves that he is not so easily manipulated as it may seem. Definitely worth a watch.
