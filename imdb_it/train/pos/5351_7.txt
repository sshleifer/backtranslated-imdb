Although this film is a bit full of eighties cheese, I have a place in my DVD rack and I don't know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is "television is rubbish, so turn it off and go get a life". For those of you who decide to listen to the message, then you should try reading the book, it's not like the movie at all. To ruin it for you at the end of the story, a mortally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the net, killing himself, all inside and closing the net at the same time. I read it many years ago but today it would be difficult not to compare it to September 11th.
