I am happy to be able to say almost only positive things about the film with Karas and the sisters Tasuiev, RENAISSANCE. <br /> <br /> And first, it looks like it should appear; An adventure for kids, RENAISSANCE is the story of an investigation by a policeman in search of a missing young scientist ?? Ilona Tasuiev, geneticist and researcher of the Avalon company. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane is, although much less known than SIN CITY, the best film and the one most appreciated by connoisseurs. For fans of French comics it will be even more significant (I enriched my collection of French comics last week, even if I'm not that high for the appointment). The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all beautiful and captivating. A Parisian policeman, Karas, is shown to find a young woman who was a rising star in medical genetic research, Ilona Tasuiev, a slightly warm blonde whose rebellious sister Bislane was erotically preferable, I imagine. <br /> For me, an old fan of comics and TV series, RENAISSANCE, a wonderfully beautiful cartoon, was like a replay of an episode of WILD WILD WEST ???, a mythological past replaced by an equally mythological future ?? ? and blasé but, in a sense, exciting. RENAISSANCE is not suspenseful; nor does it look particularly good? but it is seductive and hypnotic. Furthermore, does a world, a real world, reach sketches? and will we think of the Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, the Tasuiev sisters, and Goran, Farfella and Karas who tell of his distant childhood in Kasbah ?? . I liked the atmosphere of the RENAISSANCE, of a certain kindness, affability and adventurism, and also the professional and safe aspect; among these new cartoons, this adaptation by Linklater and Dick (the only and the first adaptation of Dick ever) stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement. <br /> <br /> I thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and, when unconventional, vividly disturbing (like the invisibility costumes). <br /> <br /> As advisable, the characters have exotic names, such as Bislane and Farfella, mostly collected from the world of art and entertainment (Goran and Ilona and Naghib ??). <br /> <br /> No one seems to have noticed that the RENAISSANCE poster has a Rourke lookalike ??? which does not make it a SIN CITY scam, but not even a comparison of originality, and in fact there is more similarity with the story of Miller, that is the dark futuristic aspect of a fallen society, the hero's wit (in fact a cross between the character of Willis and the character of Rourke in the previous film ??) ?? on the other hand, this comic breathes a more public air, a thread of pure adventure, and, in a word, is it like SIN CITY for children? well, I mean the meanest children, because there is a bit of nudity on display. To what I have said it could be argued that the traits cited are characteristic, even as clichés and clichés of the futuristic aspect of adult comics; is true, and it was old Miller who brought those things to the screen and the RENAISSANCE has some similarities here and there. Now it is also right that every RING should have its ERAGORN, so for every city of sin, its rebirth. I admit to being rather partial to these dark futuristic tales, a rather demanding specialty.
