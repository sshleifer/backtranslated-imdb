I loved this show. I watched it from the moment it first aired in the late 1990s until the last episode. In my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show that you can watch with a friend or your children. Yes, things have changed a bit with Jo since we last saw her in books, but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons. The actress who plays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job as does the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). During the series we see the developing love story between Jo and Nick, in addition to the stories and daily lessons children and students learn. I recommend this show to anyone.
