Looking at him again after an interval of many years and remembering the flop that was in its original version, I am surprised at how well it has endured. One of the reasons for his failure was that one generation thought it was an indulgent shit and a younger one was disappointed that it didn't show all the hippy glory. Now it is clear that Antonioni was already aware and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of a clear vision for the future. The head couple is excellent and it is shameful that they have taken so much criticism for the perceived failure of the film. They are ideals and perfectly convey the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in making love. I blame the others for the excessive emphasis on the sequences of student revolts at the start, but I must say that from then on it is one of the most beautiful images of the director and certainly he got the best from artificial and natural landscapes. Oh, and I didn't even mention the highly explosive ending.
