Wilson (Erica Gavin) is captured by police officers and sent to prison in this fluid and amusing example of exploitation in the early 1970s, which marks Jonathan Demme's directorial debut. After writing and producing some of Mentor Roger Cormans' New World films, Demme was offered the opportunity to direct for the first time, and offers a film that not only provides the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but it has an ironic quality charm to it as well; it's often fun and flashy. <br /> <br /> The clandestine scenes include an obscene and vulgar act in vaudeville style performed for prisoners, in addition to a powerful dream / fantasy sequence for Superintendent McQueen (and also very repressed) (icon of horror Barbara Steele, making a wonderful turn in this antagonistic role). I also liked a bank robbery scene that went haywire and a carjacking scene that was just amazing. As in other films of this type, it is also commendable that it is a portrait of female empowerment as well as pure exploitation. These women are tough, they don't take trash from anyone and they are more than capable of managing themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast here does most of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the cheeky Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin as the newcomer with wide eyes, and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire) in a brilliant appearance as an accomplice on the outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax resolves, Demme comes with a "beat time" conclusion as our heroines run to save Belle from being lobotomized by predator Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the kind of man who does not think of taking advantage of women. <br /> <br /> Bouncing on the soundtrack of John Cales, "Caged Heat" is an optimistic entertainment and a guaranteed fun. <br /> <br /> 8/10
