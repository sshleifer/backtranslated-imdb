This film is fun, fascinating and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is certainly not the place for serious history lessons, so I simply accept it as it is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, behaves quite well as the blacksmith Hank Martin, who by mistake is transported to another era, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is as breathtaking as Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hank's affections despite being promised in marriage to the courageous and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I love that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in tattered clothes and head for the highway with their backpacks live the kingdom in first person. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we are not alone" while giving his shabby clothes a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments of the film. The representation of William Bendix is ​​superbly ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at the characteristic "you old Englishmen". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep but it is well done in my opinion and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It is also a great family entertainment. <br /> <br />
