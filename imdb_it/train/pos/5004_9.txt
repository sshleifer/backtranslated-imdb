but just as fun and casual! You love it or hate it, but don't expect a sophisticated plot or a cliffhanger biting your nails. Think of Seinfeld, but without the repeated and repeated performances of extravagant characters (well ... so far, I have the feeling that I will develop the favorites as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Creature Comfort" is not for the faint moods, it is meant to be enjoyed with minimal effort from your brain. This is why this show contains everything I need in a program when I get home from work in the evening: a superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of "cute" for the characters I like when I finally look for computer to see what I miss. <br /> <br /> More fun than most of today's sitcoms, calmer than a NASCAR evening. Just the right mix of dead air and returns. I can't wait for the next one.
