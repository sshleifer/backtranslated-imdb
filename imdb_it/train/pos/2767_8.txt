Gregory Peck gives a brilliant interpretation in this film. The last 15 minutes (or so) are fantastic and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same cannot be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I'm honest) to see it is Peck. For the rest you'll be better off reading the Old Testament.
