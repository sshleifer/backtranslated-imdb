A classic cartoon, always fun and funny. It has an interesting plot full of lovable characters. Road Rovers is a show that is worth seeing, it's a short 13 episodes, and if you can ever get a chance to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they do, you should buy it too. if you have kids who like dogs, they'll love road rovers! Road Rovers should have attracted more attention as it was broadcast, it was certainly an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.
