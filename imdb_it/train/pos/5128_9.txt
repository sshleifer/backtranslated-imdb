First let me tell you I'm not from the south, but I'm an American. I don't like country music, but I can stand it. I would never wear a cowboy hat but wear a hat. I don't live in a trailer, but I eat tuna salad and I own a house. What does this have to do with this comment? Much if you are one of those people who say that only "country" people love this movie. This film is freely based on the premise "They loved and lost". James Bridges directs an American love story as real. In an age of mentality of Jerry Springer and "Put it out", this movie sounds truer than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud is "of age" and takes a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle, so he moves into the big city with them. Bud finds himself involved in the local honky tonk world for the only way out that a blue man can afford. He quickly meets Sissy who comes from a similar background and the two have a swirling love story full of painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (* This plot requires so many rounds that you have to sit for a few minutes before it engages. Marriage is a goal that is often lost. At the beginning of the film they get married and we see the passage from being single to married. The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old-fashioned man and highlights the male ego with women and competition.) <br /> <br /> Bud is challenged and excited when Micky puts in an electronic bull. Sissy has the ideas to have fun on this too, but she is immediately reminded that she is married and needs to start "acting like this". The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there, especially when (NOTE THIS IS GIVING SOME OF THE ONLINE HISTORY) they split and Sissy falls for a former swindler with a weakness for abuse and cruelty. He soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> As anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy of recognition. It was credible and real. The scene where you shave and see it for the first time at the bar ... it still gives me goose bumps. Mind you, I'm not a big Travolta fan, but come on, I see why Sissy kicked her boots so early in the movie. Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself liking to her as she took note of emotions to Bud, after sneaking in to clean her house during their separation. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first-class performance that made you hate and curse him while abusing Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, as Buds lover / girlfriend, was so authentic that the big bare-chested girls throughout the United States prayed to wake up flat-chested to wear the clothes she wore in the movie. My biggest compliments go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They looked like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and, no matter how small their role, they made the film much bigger and more realistic. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton race and the unforgettable scene in which Bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters of death. The dialogue between them is touching. <br /> <br /> If you can see this for what it is, a true American love story. Then I advise you to take it for what it is ... a movie before it's time that gave us voyeurism in a world different from ours but real enough for our fun and entertainment. If this world looks similar to yours, then you will like it much more. Finally, the music, however dated, will send you back in time if you are over 30 years old.
