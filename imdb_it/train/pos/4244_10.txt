This film has gone through the cracks in the history of cinema. It's far better than other New York films of the same era, such as "The French Connection" or "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3". There is a gritty reality in this film that also manages to effectively use humor to promote the plot. It is engaging from beginning to end and is not stained with age, as in the case of the two previous examples. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman turns into a skill like "Batman" and it's a shame that his career didn't work take off as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs and, like after "Shaft", initially seems a strange choice. And yet it is the flip side of that previous effort and has likewise come close to your machismo. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film was not made available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really does have a jewel in their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything to us.
