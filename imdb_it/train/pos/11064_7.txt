"I'll Take You There" tells of a distressed man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally on a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this small indie is primarily an ironic situational comedy with Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance. A sort of road trip with lots of fun and some moving moments keeps moving, it stays cool, and it's a useful watch for indie lovers.
