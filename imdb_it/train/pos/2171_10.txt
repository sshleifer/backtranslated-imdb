A true classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the script is a haunting succession of suspense scenes. The scenes in the car and the mountain scenes are breathtaking. I wonder if this film is already on DVD, because it has to be seen in a Widescreen version. I saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and I have never forgotten it since. I remember it was one of Warner's first feature films, a process called Warnerscope which gave a very accurate cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize is that it was not directed by someone like, says Nicholas Ray, to increase his pace and tension.
