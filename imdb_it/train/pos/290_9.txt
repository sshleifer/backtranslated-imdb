Edmund Burke said that "all the evil needs are for the good that I do nothing". Hollywood often gives us trash because there are not enough families to see quality movies. This film was an encouraging story of the loss and restoration of faith. He had no violence, no indulgence and did not deserve a PG assessment. The western scenery was well shot, and some of the views were simply breathtaking. The actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise credible and talented. The soundtrack was too noisy and in some places completely suffocated the dialogue. I rarely surprise myself more from the film finals, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes the good guys win and win with honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message and would recommend it to the whole family.
