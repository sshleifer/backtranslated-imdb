This work is less on the character of Steve Martin Davis, rather than on Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but Davis's dialogue is meditative, contemplative, almost poetic existentialism to his better . He is witty, intelligent and considerate in both distribution and content. The writers deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The shows are easy, relaxed and natural; just what you'd expect from the "A List" actors. Martin contributes to the performance that leads to his most recent job order, guiding you through life, love and the search for wisdom if not for happiness. Kline is the straight - the complete - the conformist of the film, and as such its performance is sharp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work deals with life in all respects. It generates a real emotional investment in its characters and leaves you hopeful that humanity is not destined to fail, after all, regardless of what you believe, deep down. <br /> <br /> All in all? This is delicious, with a gritty moment or two, and an easy, natural dialogue that attracts you, helping his audience get a lot of fun out of this job. It is certainly worth it, although it may not be everyone's best choice for Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really liked the intelligence that it exhibited. It is not typical, and it was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty presented here. Couples and friends hold detailed conversations, which feel and sound fully honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work, and will soon add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
