I must say that although I despise this type of show, I am a girl, I feel I must express my opinion. I had seen Dirty Sanchez before seeing Jackass and I think it surpassed Jackass in terms of creating programs. The narrative lines and interviews are intertwined to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of Jackass's movie the other night and I couldn't believe how badly it was put together, everything just joked after a joke without any relationship between anything. It must have been the easiest and fastest show to edit, beloved. While drinking vomit isn't really my thing, as far as a remarkable entertainment show is concerned, Dirty Sanchez is definitely out of the Jackass championship.
