I remember seeing him years ago when he first came out and I was struck by Parker Posey's performance. And the film was fine too. For all those who have spent too much time in the nightclub / after-hours scene, this film will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, mostly fun, and Parker Posey definitely infuses his talent into this independent gem. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the character of Diaz (he reminded me of every single DJ I've ever met). And many other films could take inspiration from this film on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and insignificant. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
