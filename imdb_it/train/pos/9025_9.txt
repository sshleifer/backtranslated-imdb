The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a small verve of acting to the story with several standard elements. Well shot, well cared for, with many well performed secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Some have stated that this film is a classic American hockey. It is this and more. I agree with those who say "The film celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration". <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasant reminder that success can come from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
