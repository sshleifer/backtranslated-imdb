Having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel so acutely, I was ready to be disappointed by the script by Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film turned out to be very well done and a good translation of the tone, naturalism and lightness of the book. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps to have read the original text before seeing the film. I imagine that the latter would seem bumpy, with very strange episodes apparently casually joined, without a prior reading of the text to help catch the plot. <br /> <br /> It is incredible to see how "dirty" the film is, given that it was shot in Dublin in 1967. Finally, the censorship of the Irish film was banned for viewing by the general public in Ireland until 2000 (it was shown to limit the public in a private cinema, the Irish Film Theater, in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and vulgar, but offers many wild "perverse" episodes. It doesn't matter that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still completely taboo when the film was made in 1967. It is surprising and encouraging to watch the cream of the 1960s Irish Profession, it respected all the players , daring to pronounce and recite the extremely transgressive text of Joyce with so much enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
