An exhilarating and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off-beat comedy by writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story takes place while the four male protagonists meet weekly at the venue to talk about their dating problems. We meet Brad: a good-looking playboy, a street wall with a sharp witty tongue; Zeek: a cynical and sensitive writer; Jonathan: a nice sexually puzzled guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married boy, who loves his weekly meetings with his single friends in hopes of some clarification of his boring and banal existence in marriage. The trials and tribulations of individual male lives in New York are expressed amusingly, reflecting that of Sex in the City and the new HBO comedy The Mind of Married Man, and bring a shrewd light to scams. The story takes a turn as the three singletons meet Mia - wittily interpreted by Amanda Peet - and everyone falls in love with her. Each one seduces them with its extraordinary ability to adapt to the personalities they exhibit. When they come to realize that everyone met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her for their friendship. Whipped is a realistic portrait of the world of events, which the critic did not recognize. Simply put, they missed the point. Here the protagonist are caricatures of real people. Exaggerations are hysterical, they mix satire and humility, and they should not be taken seriously as contempt for criticism suggests. Watch this movie, you'll laugh from beginning to end.
