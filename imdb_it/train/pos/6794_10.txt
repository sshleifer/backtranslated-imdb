I have read through most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters have big problems in life. This show, unlike most games, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose brilliance in EVERYTHING he does, was still the show's success. His genuinely bubbly personality shines like a lighthouse where he never goes. It's fun and makes you smile and that's exactly what the show does. The dancers and questions, the round fashion that are presented only add to the appeal of the shows. And even if there's a lot of money involved, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most games does not exist here. Several people who have posted messages have complained about the time spent with the dancers and by choosing the questions, except Millionaire has no similar time losses. All I can say is that many of you have lost the whole concept. The idea here is to have FUN and HAVE FUN. There is something for everyone. Qustions to test your knowledge, eye candy (dancers), suspense, Mr. Shatner's wonderful fun-filled personality ... well, if this doesn't make you think guys, then I feel bad for you ; and if that's not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. Out of ALL the games show that they have never been on, and to be honest, HATE games, this is what I really enjoyed and really miss. The only other game show I ever liked was Match Game.
