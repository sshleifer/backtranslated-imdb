I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode I repeat that sentence and I remember how beautiful this show is. I'm a big fan of science fiction and this show has the basis to be the most important science fiction (fiction?) In the history of cinema / TV. There are so many theories in this show about the universe that I could start a religion. It's amazing, season after season the show gets better and better. <br /> <br /> I've been a MacGyver fan since I was 5 (19 now) and I find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all-time star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie Stargate, I immediately liked it and considered it one of my favorite science fiction films, so I heard a TV show from it really thrilled me , but I didn't have the showtime until the fifth season was almost over. <br /> <br /> However, I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a film trilogy, but the studio opted for the series instead. <br /> <br /> The ID says that everything went well. Perhaps even better. <br /> <br /> This show is fantastic, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis, we come!
