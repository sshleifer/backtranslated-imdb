People forget that there were several scams in King Kong: Congo, King Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all do each other, but YETI stands alone. It borrows only one item from King Kong and this is the attraction of the animal with a female. <br /> <br /> The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists have been fascinated, it once existed, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth watching. The first time I saw him was on "Elvira's Mistress of the Dark Shows" in the early 1980s. It made me shiver down my spine like a child, especially when YETI got angry. I saw it again, around 1 am on ABC about 2 or 3 years ago. Watching him again made me appreciate more, he has some good general effects (for his time) and the story involves a dumb boy and his dog, and an evil businessman who wants to kill YETI for his purposes. Even the music is very beautiful, just like it is. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a great monster like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Rated 7 and half out of 10.
