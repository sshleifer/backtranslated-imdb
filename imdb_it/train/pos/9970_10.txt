The brilliant use of the exaggerated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa and Pedro summarize the behavior of the society that peers through a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although thin, stole this theme in his film "Pierrot le-fou") . Highly recommended!
