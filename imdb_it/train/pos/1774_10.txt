Setting the world of the sitcom with 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and the upcoming creation of Graham Linehan was a forgotten gem for the BBC called 'Hippies'. Although created by the couple, the six scripts were written only by Arthur Matthews. <br /> <br /> Set in London in 1969, Ray Purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his flatmate, the very relaxed and cannabis smoking Alex, his 'girlfriend' is the feminist Jill and the not-too-brilliant Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was as superb as Ray, but he is superb in everything he finds himself. This sitcom had an idea of ​​'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray was very similar to Wolfie Smith, who tried to beat the company, but failed miserably. Finally this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can't wait to buy it. As it happened in 1999 and was repeated on terrestrial television, my memories are not too good for the sitcom, but I remember two episodes very clearly, the first was the 'Protesting Hippies' aperitif, which I thought was a great start - where Ray makes a protest against the sandpaper and the other episode is "Hippy Dippy Hippies" which I think was episode 4, still a nice memory of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom had a negative reaction from the viewers (I can't think why). The BBC commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decided not to do so due to the negative reaction. Oh well, I'm looking forward to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - Episode 1 Series 4.
