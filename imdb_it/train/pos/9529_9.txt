This is one of the best films of 2002. Maybe it's not the best film, but it looks the best, it has a fantastic acting and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) in one of his works. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will go well, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) puts on his father and Michael, bringing Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to death and the second child. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) killer to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man in the organization, he tries to win over some friends who can help him, including the Mafia boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a sense, "Road to Perdition" is a standard gangster movie but it's so well done that you almost can't see it. This film is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and especially in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense even if the result is quite safe. That Hoechlin is not a nagging child and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to behave, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on a comic this film is much better than you'd expect and even if it has flaws it belongs to the best films of the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you've seen it so many times in the past, but for some reason it also seems cool at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the Hoechlin child help in that area. Watch this movie that will seem familiar sometimes, but it's completely new in many areas.
