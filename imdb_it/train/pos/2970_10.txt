I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! The witty humor made me laugh all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so exaggerated promotes the comedy of the film. <br /> <br /> I have just purchased Baseketball on DVD and it is one of those movies where you never get tired of watching it. I have a very short attention span and I think this movie has so many fun parts to keep me entertained all the time. Humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later .. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, especially if you are younger me like it will make you laugh for a long time afterwards. <br /> <br /> P.s Does anyone think it's strange for me to appreciate them both? hehe
