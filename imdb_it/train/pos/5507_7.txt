I would not be surprised if pressure was applied to Soderbergh to avoid making Cuba revolutionary as graphically corrupt as it was. Only a few statistics will not do it with the younger audience. However, the first part, which is almost entirely filmed in the jungle, captures the feeling of that place, especially when crossing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, did a great job, against all odds. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look down on these people, but it is also clear that he will not entrust their case to 'yanquis' far from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I have read. As far as I know, Castro did not appeal to the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States have been exhausted. But on other aspects he is right, especially with regard to the looting by expatriates, while the island has passed to the other rebels. The town's treasury has been left empty.
