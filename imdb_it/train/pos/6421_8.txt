"Men of honor" - the true story of a proud and persistent diver of the Black Navy (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is certainly a great film that touches and amuses and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Wonderful acting is the main reason to make this film something really special and a pleasant and enjoyable experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as a rough, ferocious and merciless Billy Sunday leader - the role is pretty much written for him. This film along with fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) are two of the latest rehearsals that is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Men of honor" includes a beautiful performance by Cuba Gooding Jr. who was one of the most promising young black actors from "Boyz n the hood". "Men of honor" goes straight into the company of "Jerry Maguire", "However good" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor and I am ready to receive many fantastic films from him. "Men of honor" also has a fairly excellent plot and probably the most exciting dive sequences in the history of cinema. This is a fantastic and fascinating film and I can only recommend it.
