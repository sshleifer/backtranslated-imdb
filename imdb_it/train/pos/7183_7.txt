This is a perfect series for family viewing. We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an updated version of Robin Hood and is aimed at children and adults. Our teenager and tween-agers love sitting with mom and dad and watching Robin's upcoming feats. We can't wait for the next episode airing every week and we're happy with the free "On Demand" view. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a current fashion point. There is a moral in every story. It is funny. Violence is not exaggerated or useless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feeling of John William. It is an old-world tale that is brought back to life with a new touch of the world. <br /> <br /> There is so much rubbish on television from the brain that makes TV "reality" rot to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and this is a "Robin Hood" updated to not be compared to the cinematic prowess of Errol Flynn. This is a gem for everyone to enjoy. Parents worried about their children watching too much violence will appreciate the fact that Robin has lost the taste for war and massacre. It is a Robin Hood who would rather try to reason to get out of a disagreement than to fight. Maid Marian is also a fascinating model for young girls. Rather than watching and doing nothing, she takes her role in helping the poor by being the "Night Watcher". The sheriff of Nottingham is delightfully exaggerated, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, which makes most women want to not play the role of a bad "boy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Brother Tuck?"
