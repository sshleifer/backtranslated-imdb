I was having the worst day of my life. Then I came across this cute movie, I saw it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a lamppost. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I saw it only for 2 reasons: THE LEGS OF VERA-ELLEN. But it's really much more. The plot is actually quite intelligent and creatively woven. It's almost a Shakespearean comedy with all its delicious misunderstandings. And of course there is also ... LEGS OF VERA-ELLEN. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I purchased (the "100 Family Classics" collection by Mill Creek Entertainment) did not have the best video quality, and I felt the same about the Alpha version. The brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so many scenes seem faded especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can tinker with your TV controls to compensate. I can only imagine how he appeared on the big screen in '51. The stage sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and deliciously gruesome - in a vein of "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet". <br /> <br /> As for the romance, this is simply perfect. Not mushy, not invented, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, poor schmuck, your miserable lives will never be so fascinating. Har har har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life sucks as much as yours. For all the underworld. It's time to watch this movie again.
