After seeing several Villaronga films, I had a clear opinion of him - he focuses too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting a rhythm of the film. That's why, despite having good critics, his films have never attracted the attention of the public. In ARo follows the same line, but really improves to the rhythm, especially at the end of the film. Frankly, I slept in the first part, even if the first part provides the necessary information, it's very slow. However the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole film the best film ever made by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
