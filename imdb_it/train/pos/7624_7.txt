A rather memorable film of the variety of animal-killing-persons, in particular similar to "Willard" as it recites an aging character actor (in this case, a step back from the level of Les Tremayne, which puts the one distinct performance that I saw him give) in a role of man whose life is unbalanced and who later decides to use his animal friends to take revenge on those who hurt him. Yes, this is one of those films in which virtually everyone is contemptible, so you will be rooting when they die, and really selecting actors, places, etc. It could not be better in giving the film an atmosphere of dreary decadence. <br /> <br /> The character of Tremayne is "Snakey Bender", and it is certainly the most interesting thing in the film: an old snake collector obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When the local preacher represses his practice of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend marries a stripper (thus upsetting his ritual Wednesday night band concert) he breaks out in the process a memorable gathering of clunkers under the cliff where he unloaded the wrecks after eliminating their unfortunate owners. A fun game you can play while watching "Snakes" is placing bets on which machines will land farther down the cliff. <br /> <br /> All in all, very cheap and exploitative, but it will be a lot of fun for fans of this type of film.
