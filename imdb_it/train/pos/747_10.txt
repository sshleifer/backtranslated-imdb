Although I was born in the year that this film was released and I had never heard of it until my last year of high school (1996), when I saw it I became totally engrossed, laughing, crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and words were obsolete but the emotions and despair of every situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how much I wanted them to make movies like that again. <br /> <br /> In fact I saw this movie in the evening after attending a crazy party (not so different from the one in Jay's house) that had been smashed by those we considered the derelict losers who were lurking at the edge of our crowd. A world-class BS'er character and "responsible" of my mother identified immediately with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car) even though I had a bit of Madge's insecurities floating in there. My best friend was a Deidre and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene when Jeanie is at school or the one where she and her boyfriend split up and then tell Madge how much she loved him like the conversations and situations I had personally experienced. <br /> <br /> At the age of 27 I recently saw the film and felt a wave of emotions because it was like looking back at a piece of my youth (even though none of my friends died). I think this is a must see for all girls ages 13 and up.
