Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very fun SCI-FI movie from Japan. I noticed a lot of disappointed fanatics who loved Versus, this director's debut film or his third film Azumi. I heard they are blood-soaked movies with swords and zombies and all sorts of goodies. I honestly went to the video store to get Versus, but I'm fine with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action from the beginning to the end of the wall, then Alive is not your choice. There is a lot of action, but it comes as a fallback for a whole hour of character-driven growth. Personally I think it's well done and it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Obviously part of the plot is as silly as with many SCI-Fi action movies and I think subtitles that use the term foreign may have replaced them with the parasite for a greater effect. This film is brutal when it needs to be so weak of heart it is not necessary to apply. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget down for the most part by confining all the action in an underground building (inspired by the cube) but the film does not suffer from it. Another bonus for this film are the intense gothic images created with great artistic flair during the numerous flashbacks and dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
