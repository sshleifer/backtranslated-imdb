If you like science fiction, monsters and ancient legends, then you'll love this movie !! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. Although the acting could be a little less desirable, the plot and the effects adequately compensated for it. <br /> <br /> Now I wish I had seen it in the cinema on a movie screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TVs. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, fantastic images and a taste for myth and tradition .... you must see this movie !!
