Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan bring their pack from Seattle to Alaska and Canada to claim a complaint. Once there, they have to deal with the seductive and unfortunate businesswoman Ruth Roman and the frigid and carefree villain James McIntire. <br /> <br /> John Wayne could talk more, but his good friend Stewart also did some excellent and sharp-edged westerns, some with the great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I'd take it, with its robust action sequences and its refined melodrama, all of North Alaska every day! <br /> <br /> The Far Country offers breathtaking landscapes and cinemas that should have been shot in large format. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is a strong support from the ever-reliable Brennan, Roman (who is fantastic), the incredibly cute Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad, the type that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended western by Mann / Stewart northwest, Bend Of The River.
