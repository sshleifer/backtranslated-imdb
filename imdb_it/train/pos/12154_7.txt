Yes, a horror dancing thriller ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is demented and campy fun and part of the 1960s guignol cycle that was leaked in the 1970s. Released as a dual function with the Burt Reynolds comedy, FUZZ, this crazy fear is so strong that it is really fun. As a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, THE OTHER and BABY JANE, I suggest any potential viewer to assume the idea that this is almost destined to be skew-iff and sit with someone with whom you can scream and elbow all through it. Actually, get drunk while watching it ..... with cheap champagne. Again, with many cinematographic ideas from the 1930s, it is also about disappointment; the struggle of time for a better life that becomes bitter and distorted by the emotional madness that falls in the murder. But this is simply crazy. It also reminds me of BLOODY MAMA the De Niro - Winters shlock fest which makes this film definitely positive.
