Okay, this was a pretty sensitive number but I can't help but think I saw it before. It reminds me of another VCA movie I saw in Poitier titled "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE". It also had points of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in its performance. Which does not mean that they are not tasteful references ... only that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel that this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and history) than to the work of an original and authentic autograph to come. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is ... too perfect for my taste. Filter too much coral (or charcoal) for my taste ... too framed 12mm. So the whole impression left me a little distant - watch out for the art that is proclaimed too easily! The French (they are a conservative group) seem to buy it as the jury did, however ... but the Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to its feature selection, although I wonder what has happened in recent years.
