Simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and I don't like it. I guarantee you will finish watching the season. Then I guarantee you will watch season 2. <br /> <br /> More reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. The locations in Europe are fantastic 3. The games are mentally challenging 4. It's very interactive 5. In one episode a player responds to another player's desperate, "I'm trying as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate, "Not necessarily". <br /> <br /> Can you understand ... Who is the mole?
