Gene Kelly had some really great ideas for musicals while with MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative powers working with the music unit of Arthur Freed. Hard to believe when you look at An American In Paris that players have never left the lottery back to MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and to the sets that MGM has designed by fusing them with some background shots. The idea for the film was born with Kelly who simply wanted to make a film with a long sequence of ballets involving the poem by George Gershwin, An American in Paris. Sounds good to Arthur Freed approaching Ira Gershwin who said well with him until he used other Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin obtained the kind of accord for Gershwin's music that Irving Berlin normally has. Not a single note of non-Gershwin music is heard in an American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me that aren't real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who was a good hand in writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story which is certainly subtle. Everything about an ex-GI starring Gene Kelly who never left France after World War II, settled in an apartment on the Left Bank and became a starving artist. He lives with the eccentric composer Oscar Levant and makes it seem like a redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he repay on other issues. But Kelly falls in love with a shop girl played by Leslie Caron in her debut film. Caron also has an interest in the Georges Guetary musical comedy. <br /> <br /> Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris seems to be the first film I've ever seen as a movie in flight on the first airplane trip I've ever made. I still remember the flight back from Phoenix, Arizona to Kennedy Airport, with Gene Kelly doing I've Got Rhythm. My favorite number in the film, however, is Tra-La-La that Kelly sings and dances around the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point Kelly dances on top of the grand piano. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote in which he said that in the American ballet sequence in Paris it had to be done against the backdrop of the French Impressionists who believed the audience would rather have preferred than a realistic environment for the streets or the back. So it happened that way. Kelly had made long ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But this has overcome them all. Still in my opinion and this includes some of Gene Kelly's next films. <br /> <br /> With surprise at the Oscars, An American In Paris was chosen as the best film for 1951, beating the favorite A Streetcar Named Desiderio. I imagine that imaginative realism had that year. Big budgets also have an advantage in these things. <br /> <br /> Still An American of Paris is one of the best musicals ever made and as the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.
