This film has problems in its presentation, it can also be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural fidelity, but it challenges the observer to reflect on a variety of problems. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and of faith. And third, it is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the relationship between Christ and the traitor is developed and maintained through the film. The passion of Judas is presented as a more obscure parallel than that of Christ. When Judas takes his life, the viewer can perceive anguish. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not so strongly interpreted as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and a provocative Christ, credible or not. I would like to find this film on DVD or even VHS, to be used in study or discussion groups.
