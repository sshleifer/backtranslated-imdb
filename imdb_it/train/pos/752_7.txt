Four teenage girls in a Los Angeles suburb find themselves in all kinds of problems: parties, drugs, cops, mixed parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, a kind of mother hen, tries to keep everyone together as "a family" (like the family unit she never had), and the harrowing thing about the film is that she can't. Slowly, everyone grows up and leaves. Unfortunately that precise point of the plot, although underlined, is unfortunately tampered with. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio going over a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence - even with Baio - in which Foster has a strange soliloquy on the "pain of illusion". Some of the dialogues, in fact, are decidedly casual, and I didn't care much about a late editing in the movie that follows awkwardly from a death to a marriage. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very delicate story about the loss of a close bond. And Jodie's face eventually speaks volumes. If the spectators get stuck at the end, the film has earned this. He does not tear or cry for compassion. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes that we understand. *** from ****
