The question whether a film version of "The Ghost Train" like it or not, invariably depends on one thing and one thing only: your reaction to Arthur Askey's performance. <br /> <br /> It tends to steal almost every scene it is in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you would like it to settle or stop a bit, to allow the numerous characters of the plot to appear and develop (which they do somehow). But somehow everything continues to focus on Askey's Tommy Gander character. <br /> <br /> I personally like the movie, and even Askey to a greater extent. I always seem to cry in the VCR in those strange early-morning hours when I can't sleep and I really can't find the energy to look at anything else. There is something about watching old black and white movies in the dark stillness of pre-dawn that I find attractive ...
