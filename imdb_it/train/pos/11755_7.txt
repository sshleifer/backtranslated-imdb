I love this movie, but the music of all the alumni meetings is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played at the dances etc. they are from the 50s and early 60s. <br /> <br /> Having just attended my 30th high school meeting, I can assure you that the last music to play in a meeting or dance of the former high school people are the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music from the 1970s - we all know that time has been musically desolate. But it was not completely private and the producers of the film should have paid more attention. I found those dance scenes very strident due to my otherwise despotic suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> This was a bad director and / or decision of the producer.
