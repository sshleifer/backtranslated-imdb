At 2 years of age, he likes the Doodlebops show, he seems to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, vibrant with primary colors and all. There is not a lot of educational content that the target audience can benefit from, but it seems that every theme has a theme and try to teach children how to share, respect and other basic notions, so I like it for this. It is well produced with high production values. But in reality it's just an average show like most TV shows these days. We do not buy the corner of the goods and we have our son wear the whole Dooblebop. I don't think that spending money to go to a live show, if they ever come to the city. Going to the zoo or science center is a far better experience for everyone involved and I think money is better spent.
