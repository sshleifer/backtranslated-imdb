the whole acting of the first season was really incredible. Max and Zach's first look is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or how I like to call them the minis. minis do the best acting job I've ever seen kids do. the main actors and actresses, Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly, etc., make you forget that you are looking at a fiction t.v. show that they seem to make this show come alive. all in all this is the best show I've ever seen
