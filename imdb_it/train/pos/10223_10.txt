* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms unfounded (acting, dated dialogues, unclear storyline). Belafonte is as big as a brandoesco, threatening spirit that has to earn its wings but is realistically ill-equipped by its past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his frantic and materialistic life is without love. Mostel is also as big as a distressed man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds that the characters represent alternately collide and complete each other, the result is exhilarating and moving. <br /> <br /> The perplexed ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After searching all over Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he reaches it frantically as if he were finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle (or to restore Fanny's health or the faith of Mostel), so he never managed to get his wings. The feather floats provocatively out of the grip of Mostel, a metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you don't have a second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life", this film is magical, wonderful, fun, but terribly tragic.
