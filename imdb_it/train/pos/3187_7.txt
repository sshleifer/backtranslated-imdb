A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs that contained two films each. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternative title for The Grree Had a Word for Them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and is about a mistaken identity involving one of the dancers making a turn from a millionaire's limousine. Vera-Ellen is that ballerina e-wow, what legs! Ceasar Romero is his producer who takes a chance after the main protagonist leaves because he plans to go out with the millionaire I just talked about. And David Niven is that rich guy who, when he looks for Vera-Ellen, is mistaken for a journalist who should interview her but is blocked by Romero. What I just mentioned could be confusing but (above all) it makes sense if you are willing to control your brain as you watch this fascinating broom play with wonderful musical numbers performed by the exquisite Mrs. Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a little hectic here but Niven gets hilariously amused. The print I saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen does very well with her jokes since she's not really an actress. So on that note, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie fans who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
