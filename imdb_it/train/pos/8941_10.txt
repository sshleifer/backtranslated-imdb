I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a pair What sacrifices have they made to live life on their terms. This is not just a film for African Americans, but for all Americans. It is a sort of history lesson and a documentary in one and combined with a fun film biography. The acting was superior for everyone and we really saw the difficulties that these two sisters have been through for many years. Both sisters are quite different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family with high, perhaps even impossible standards of perfection. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I highly recommend this movie and I'm glad I saw it on television the other day.
