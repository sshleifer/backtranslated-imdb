What people fail to understand about this film is that it is not a beginning, a medium and an end, it is only the conclusion of a 26-episode television series. So remember that when you talk about how the world hasn't been explored enough. All this was done in the television program. <br /> <br /> No matter how big and surprising the images are, I think the topic *** SPOILERS *** between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo towards the end of the film was what really made me love this movie. Seeing characters I had followed in 26 episodes quarreling like that was distressing, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly alone in the floating ruins while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking. <br /> <br /> Then we had a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting against these incredibly fantastic dragons (which had been described earlier in the series) while Gwizdo was babbling madly and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene was no longer mentioned in the warnings. Any child who has a lick of sense will be able to see that Gwizdo was not himself and was completely intent on strangling that child. It was enough to annoy me, and I'm 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The world is fantastic, the plot is much better than most of the millions of blockbusters, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. :)
