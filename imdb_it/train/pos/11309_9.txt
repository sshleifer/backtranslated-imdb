A masterful treatment of "The postman always rings twice" by James Caine as Luchino Visconti's first film shot mainly around Ferrara in an Italy without a war-torn soul. The original negative was destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately today we can see this neo-realist work. A robust and fascinating Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently revealed his breast in La Cena delle beffe "(1941), are the sensual and unlucky lovers who plot to kill her husband. An unusual ending in which, despite the crime pay, you pay in a way not directly related to crime: excellent direction, screenplay, acting and cinematography, referring not to the French "Le Dernier tournant" (1939) but probably better than the American version (1946)) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the main roles, highly recommended.
