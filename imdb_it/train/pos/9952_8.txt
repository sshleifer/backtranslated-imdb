Before watching this movie I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie Flashpoint was the last film by Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong I had seen before. As for the sexual scenes, I was disappointed, I thought that the Dreamquest sexual scenes would be fantastic as Flashpoint's sexual scenes but I was disappointed. Except for Asia Carrera's sexual scene, any sexual scene in this film doesn't make me feel good (you know what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson doesn't make that kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both those adorable girls disappoint me with regards to sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a movie for adults, but if apart from this factor of sexual scenes, this film is very good. Considering the typical standards of adult films, this film has certainly raised the standards of adult films. History, acting, direction, set design, make-up and other technical material of this film are really fantastic. The actors in this film played really well, they did a great job. Dreamquest has certainly raised the quality level of adult films.
