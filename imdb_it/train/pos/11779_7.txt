After reading Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed with the series, but all in all it is quite instructive. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the "warriors of culture" are at work, seeing "attacks" on "Western civilization" under every rug. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little preacher? Sure. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. Use the phrase "guns, germs and steel" apparently at every opportunity during the series. We get it after about the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simplistic (in the series)? Sure. The part about Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing a very long and complicated story up to "smallpox, swords and horses", enveloping the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things have actually contributed (but do not totally define) the reasons for the success of Spanish against established cultures. <br /> <br /> Are you preaching * against * Western civilization in any way? No. Not a word. Not in my ear. All he says is that luck has played an important role in determining which cultures progressed faster, * not * that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that affect how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
