I saw it on the big screen and was encapsulated by it. The period of the years of Queen Victoria is a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was pushed into one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the acting is extraordinary, the story and attention to detail are out of this world. Emily Blunt is as perfect as Victoria. Funny how his mother is played by Elizabeth I and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think of Blackadder). This portrait of Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would have been at the Jeremey Kyle Show if she had been around then: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of an important part of the history of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.
