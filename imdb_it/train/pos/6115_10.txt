Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenic inexorably explores the world of the extreme with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravated, killer and drug addict writer who will stop at nothing to destroy those that stand between him and madness. Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist rubber dummy, Harry begins his murderous madness. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins comes the first episode of the meanest story ever filmed <br /> <br /> The only other movie I saw similar to this would be the second episode titled Schizofreniac Necromaniac <br /> <br /> This is a very low budget film and it won't be for everyone, but if you're looking for something scary, different and horrible then this would be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WAIT FOR ANYTHING AS A MODERN MOORING OF THE DAY (like Scream) <br /> <br /> Viewer discretion is recommended
