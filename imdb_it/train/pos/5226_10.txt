What is there with all the European comments (especially in England)? All I have to say is that when I saw this film for the first time when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. This is the point. You have to see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come on people, what did you expect to see? I can think of many films that are much worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors. For what it's worth, Men in White is a fake stupid-fun movie. And with all the nonsense that England has done over the last half century, I'm shocked by all the negative comments. We stupid Americans love our stupid humor. P.S., see "Team America: World Police" for some real laughs that Europeans will particularly appreciate.
