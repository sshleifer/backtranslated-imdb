I have had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film portrays how many they are, unfortunately. They are very clever, ruthless and greedy, as well as highly unjust. From robotic sex, from the bustle for gifts, to lies and betrayal, I lived all this in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: here are the photojournalists of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of photos of many Russian girls I met, black comedy, scams I knew about, and the story of my robbery and appearance on Russian national TV. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent a lot of time putting it together. So take a look. The Russian woman who plays Nicole Kidman is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photojournalists. <br /> <br /> My 3 spouses looking for spouses in Russia are very exciting and sell, so why don't they make a movie from my bride looking for adventures in Russia? However, there is an actual impossibility in this film, and this is the way the guy orders his bride from a catalog and her arrival at an airport. That doesn't work at all, so I don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate it. There is no website for presenting the Russian bride that works this way, and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is that you can only order the Russian lady's contact information (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there, run and then visit, and if you want to take it to your country, begin the immigration process at your INS office and wait a few months later. That's how it works in real life. You can't just order them to arrive at your airport. US immigration would never allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I wanted by going abroad!
