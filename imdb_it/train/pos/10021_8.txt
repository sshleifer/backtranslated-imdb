This story based on two pieces by Edgar Allen Poe ("The Fall of Usher's House", "Dance of Death" (poem)) is actually quite disturbing from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people meeting in an old decrepit house (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize guests. He dies at the beginning of the film (or he?) And the inhabitants of the house are subjected to a series of terrifying experiences. I won't go into too much detail here, but it's definitely a must for fans of the old mysteries of the dark house. <br /> <br /> Watch it with a lot of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <Br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
