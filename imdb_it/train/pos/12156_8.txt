Some of the basic details of this story are based, very, very vaguely, on real events of the era in which it was inserted. The story combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case along with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) who are persecuted as they leave a courtroom. The crowd seems very keen to hurt them physically because their children have just been convicted of a thrilling crime. A person in the crowd apparently injures Winters' hand as they make their way to a waiting car. <br /> <br /> Shortly after arriving home, they start receiving threatening phone calls, so Reynolds suggests that they both move west to Costa together and open a dance school. The dance school is a hit and they turn to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is a multimillionaire who is quite in love with Reynolds and they start dating. Life seems very good. But, when the threatening phone calls start again, Winters responds by chasing away - behaving as if she were approaching a psychotic break-up and she withdraws more and more into religion - listening to "Sister Alma" on the radio almost constantly. Again and again, see Winters on the edge and eventually culminate in very bad things !! I won't say anything else, because it could ruin this suspenseful and interesting movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is very similar to the horror films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford of the '60s as "Whatever Happened" to Baby Jane? "," Straight-Jacket "and" The Nanny ". While none of these is exactly the intellectual price, at kitsch level they are immensely fun and entertaining. The writing is very good and there are good twists towards the end that make it all very exciting. Winters is as big as a fragile and demented woman and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 years I've ever seen - besides really, really dancing. <br /> <br /> My only concern with all this is that some may find Winters' hyper-religiosity in the film a bit tacky - like an economic attack on Christianity. At first I felt that way, but when you meet Sister Alma, she seems sincere and is not ridiculed, so I took Winters' religious zeal as a simple sign of madness - which, I assume, is all that was meant. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is packaged along with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" - a another horror film by Shelley Winters from 1971. Both are very funny ... and rather exaggerated!
