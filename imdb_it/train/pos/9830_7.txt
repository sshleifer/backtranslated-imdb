No one really understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie movies, but ?? honestly ?? why should we worry? Every single film in the "Zombi" series offers fun, blood and free shocks and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during the shooting. This film started as an interesting project by Lucio Fulci, who had to go deeper into his success "Zombi 2", but in the end it became a typical product of Bruno Mattei with more flaws and stolen ideas than previous films. The script is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every brilliant idea of ​​"The Night of the Living Dead" by George A. Romero and "The Crazies" is shamelessly repeated here and the performances are really miserable and painful to watch. Yet all this has not upset me for an instant because the exaggerated sublime gore compensates for everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, scientists completed the "Death One" bacterial war virus and prepare it for transportation. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the ashes of zombies contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors must fight hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies, as well as soldiers in white overalls who have been instructed to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to "Nightmare City" by Umberto Lenzi. Really bad ... but incredibly fun with fast-paced action sequences and different situations of very creative zombie madness. The undead birds were original, for example, and the entire zombie birth sequence in the deserted hospital was pretty good. The infamous flying head scene is not as horrible as it was invented and it belongs perfectly to this tasteful and absolutely enjoyable Italian zombie movie. Recommended for fans; no matter the negative reviews.
