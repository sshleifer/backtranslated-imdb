Thanks to Kevin Smith, a group of geeks are running saying that Return of the Jedi is not good because it's really fun to watch. And oh no! The Muppets are involved! This makes it bad! Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it. Now suddenly people look at you like you have some kind of illness if you say how much you like it. This film is much better than anything else that Kevin Smith ever thought of creating and that drives me mad that the man would even think of reporting it. This movie is fun! It's amazing how I remember it when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing the opinions of Kevin Smith! Its not correct! <br /> <br /> And that Ewok song finally dominated! I bet people don't even like "Ewok: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'll fire you all!
