This film is obviously low budget and shot in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that have been overcome to make this film convincing (set in California and in the 60s and 80s) have been well conceived. I think this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac murders that has plagued the city of Vallejo and the Bay area since 1968-19? (has never been captured). Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen, after being cleaned from DNA and fingerprints) play a game of cats and mice that re-appropriate crime scenes together, each of which tries to unleash the other in an emotional revelation.Olimia dies from some kind of terminal illness and knowing that Dzundza did it, still totally obsessed with losing his family and becoming a full-blown alcoholic along the way. unaware and completely absorbed (like all serial killers) to the carnage left in its wake. The only disappointment was the "over the top" which ended up being fairly accurate. If you get tired of the typical Hollywood hair or are interested in the Zodiac case, check.
