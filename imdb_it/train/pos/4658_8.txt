It's about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors ever to appear anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions", a fun and wacky comedy with Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a former embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a company run by Malden - with the aim of embezzlement in mind. It is not a regular navigation; has attracted the attention of his competitor in the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him in their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a short time. He fails to maintain a job and is seen throughout the film in a variety of jobs, ending in dismissal. When Newhart gives her advances, he invites Ustinov to his curry apartment for cover, but the two soon decide that they are made for each other. Of course, you don't know that Ustinov is a scammer. <br /> <br /> This is such a beautiful film - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius and the ways he tears himself out of trouble. But there is an ending that will show you who really has the brain. Don't miss this movie set in 1960s London. It is worthwhile if only to hear Maggie Smith whine, "I was fired."
