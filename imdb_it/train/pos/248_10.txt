'Ned Kelly' is an Australian film made wonderfully in honor of a true Australian hero. We are brought into the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and the other members of Kelly Gang, as he explains the film and perhaps justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional cast, all of which give stellar performances, which give life to the film. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was as fantastic as Joe, playing the role of a quiet and loyal gentleman very well. I was overwhelmed by the moment. For a moment I almost believed that the Gang would win the battle at Glenrowan, alas, it didn't have to be. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid fan of Ned Kelly (and supporter), he was slightly disappointed with this. Perhaps the film could have gone longer, to cover more of Kelly Gang / Ned's life - I felt not covered enough. <br /> <br /> Regardless of some flaws, this is a moving film, which moves all sorts of emotions. (And hey, I guess this movie would be better to watch rather than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned ...)
