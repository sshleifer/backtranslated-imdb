Very clever humor Excellent interpretation I can't believe how people might think you deserve a 1/10! I hope this film is shown everywhere so that everyone can enjoy it. If you ever get the chance, watch it ... don't lose it. There's a part when the main actors guide and sing "Happy birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (one Argentine song for children (I think ... it could also be South American, I'm not sure)). These two songs that have the same melody ... but people don't usually realize that ... it's just a grate! I tried to write this in Spanish and English, because it's an Argentine film ... but the page wouldn't let me :( I hope you like it!
