... and I'm serious. If not literally (after all, I haven't seen all the movies ever created!), At least, of course, among those, the many I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The empirical rule with IMDb is this: sometimes the films evaluated very well (for example, the Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap piece called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely is a movie worth looking at actually rated below 6. This movie, which is really worth watching, is. A shame. <br /> <br /> True, I give him a 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. His real score should be an 8 or a 9. He has some acting defects (especially Belafonte), the script sometimes wanders. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, who directed two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, the greatest of the Zero life Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in a poetic / moral acting / tour de force. A couple made in heaven! It is true that this film, apart from the faults, does not appeal to the average public, but to those interested in watching an excellent film (while, again, not beyond the criticism) of the incomparable director who gave us "The Shop on the Main Street "(the best film ever on the Holocaust) should not miss this, just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that" American Beauty "is better than" The Angel Levine ". <br /> <br /> It is not.
