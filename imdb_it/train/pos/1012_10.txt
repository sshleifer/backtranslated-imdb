Stargate SG-1 is a spin-off of the 1994 movie "Stargate". I am so happy that they have decided to go deeper into the subject. The show starts from the first episode, a pensioner Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once again to meet his old partner, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not allow anyone to walk on her, and there is Teal'c, a calm and compassionate warrior who challenges his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main villains are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be inserted into the brain, controlling them and doing evil deeds. Any Gouald who has a great deal of power is often considered a "Lord of the System". The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, which houses the Gouald parasite in their bodies until the Gouald can be inserted into a person's brain. <br /> <br /> Through the episodes, we see mostly SG-1, the exploratory team composed of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, goes through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device it's called Stargate) and meets new cultures or villains. Some episodes are on-world, which means that they don't go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing problems on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you begin to see a decline in the SG -1 squad like tight shirt, and more story lines that build characters. This, in turn, means even more episodes of the world, which is perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, there are some cases of narrative lines not always starting and less emphasis on travel in recent years . But still, first-rate science fiction!
