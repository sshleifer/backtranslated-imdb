Very sweet pilot. The show stinks of Tim Burton's best films ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, storytelling, music, outdoor sets all scream Tim Burton. There must be a connection, or a STRONG influence, I haven't done enough research to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw in the forums, yes Anna Friel plays a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see it on the screen, I see Zooey. Don't get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and lovable and you will easily become attached to her. It is more a distraction than I keep thinking "Why didn't they get Zooey Deschanel". Even Lee Pace does a great job. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and I just checked. Wonderfalls !!! Stunning series, short-lived since 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies you should definitely rent Wonderfalls, which is another Brian Fuller creation ?? Hmmmm <br /> <br /> Loved to see Swoosie Kurtz (World Second Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two actresses of undervalued character who never fail to bring it with their performances.
