Someone knows the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick on the move, was it supposed to be you? Was he talking to Charlie and Annna in the church while they were leaving? If not, I'll have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my one true love (my soul mate) and even though I had the experience of meeting him when I least expected it, I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Altho, we got married, I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I was pleased and took his love for granted and he resisted it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> Finally he came out with resentment, but we're still hurt, angry and incredulous about how it ended. I had some very difficult lessons to learn and we have been separated for 3 years. <br /> <br /> This film meant a lot because I'm still waiting to reconcile myself with my one true love. I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside me and Father Fitzpatrick's quotation resonated for me. <br /> <br /> I know that when he is healed enough to trust me, we will remarry. <br /> <br /> NEVER GET COMPLETE AND TAKE THE TRUE LOVE TO GRANT! IT WAS THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> Even the music in this film is OUTSTANDING and SIGNIFICANT! This film is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth the wait, if you want to be, it will, no matter what, it WILL HAPPEN! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time! Thank you!
