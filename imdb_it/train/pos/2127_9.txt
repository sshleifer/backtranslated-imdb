Defining this romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. The genre has unfortunately deteriorated into clichés, too focused on making the main couple united and with very little space for setting and other stories, making it formidable and too predictable. <br /> <br /> The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a recognizable Middle Eastern-European atmosphere and has a strong cast in addition to nominal (even strong) leads; I avoid using the words 'support cast' such as Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role in the film and his story is equally if not more important than the love story. <br /> <br /> The 1998 movie You've Got Mail borrowed the idea of ​​an "anonymous pen pal" from this film and was therefore heralded as a remake. This is incorrect and in fact unfair to the new film - it shares the genre and borrows an element of plot, but that's all.
