I saw this film many years ago and left a lasting impression on me. Alas, I've hardened a lot of movies over the years and I didn't expect to be hit by "Kalifornia" after seeing it again recently. I am pleased to say that it is as unnerving and as watchable as it was a decade ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this film its power. The first is his cast. We have an incredibly disturbing turn from a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Knowing Pitt, like all of us, as one of the most enduring Hollywood I've ever had, it's nice to see him play such a vile and unattractive character. Pitt pulls the show without resorting to clich√© or white-trash parody, and manages to remain truly terrifying throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is equally impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, playing the character like a decade old girl with a life experience of forty years. Lewis manages to evoke pity (for the position of his character in life) and contempt (for his naivety), but subtends his performance with that kind of subtlety rarely seen by such a young actor. Personally, I think it is a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis have been nominated for any awards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly expressed as the yuppy couple who unintentionally end up traveling across the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is rightly ingenious and naive, and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and closed, but both actors manage to portray their characters' changes convincingly because they are equally intrigued, rejected and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> Refined casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside, this film really grabs us from the proverbial balls through its impeccable rhythm. At the time "Kalifornia" was released, Hollywood released a series of psychotic films that turned into a sympathetic character ("Single White Female", "Pacific Heights", "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle", 'Deceived', ' Sleep with the enemy 'etc.). Most of these films have followed the same formula, the only variation is the nature of the relationship between good and bad. "Kalifornia" does not stray too far from this territory, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow-boiling thriller, and we remained on the sidelines of our seats waiting for the tide to turn. /> <br /> When the penny falls, and Pitt is free to play the bad maniac, the film completely changes gear and the last twenty minutes are not up to the rest of the film. That being said, the action is dense and fast and the resolution is suitable for the cold. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the narrative (provided by a slightly plaintive, pre-X Duchovony) is a bit forced. Of course, it is due to the book that the character of the Duchovony journalist wrote, so it could be argued that the self-conscious narrative is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalist style in which most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The film is largely a hit and is definitely a cut over 90% of the thrillers of the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the faint of stomach or mind. This film disturbs more than one level. But then, it is destined to be.
