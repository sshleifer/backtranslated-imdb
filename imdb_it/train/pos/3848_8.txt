Gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and something clairvoyant, or so it seems. During a trip to Flushing he is "seduced" by Christine. When he finds out that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of a rough trade from which he started from afar, he decides to stay. After all, forced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then he realizes that Christine's previous three husbands have all died of violent deaths. Christine killed them and is he or the boy, Herman, who will be the "fourth man"? Verhoeven's overheated and overprinted melodrama is a delightful mixture of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images and lots of red. Many times it seems and seems like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or the result of Gerard's imagination. Fun is in understanding. Even the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likeable character than either the gardoso Gerard or the confident Herman means that men are hardly rooted on her. Indeed, it is fair to say that Gerard's coming cannot come soon enough. Super performances also by Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and the best Verhoeven film up to his fantastic subversive movie of "Starship Troopers".
