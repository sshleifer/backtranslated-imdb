If "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and German expressionist cinema), this pre-WWI film is the grandfather. The titular student, hungry in an empty attic, makes a pact with the Devil ... the Devil gives him a sack without a golden bottom, in exchange for "anything in this room". The devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. He moves away with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes for which the student is blamed. <br /> <br /> The film is marked by some limitations deriving from the technically primitive state of the cinema of 1913; the plot cries due to the effects of chiaroscuro, but the film is, of necessity, practically turned into a light without shadows. But the scene in which the reflection comes out of the mirror continues to fill the wall. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends that depicts that for the sole purpose, the Prague Student is still worthwhile.
