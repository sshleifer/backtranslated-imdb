The spectators of 1936 must have been stunned by what they were watching: a real full-length technicolor film. I can't say for sure, but this may have been the first (3 strips). In any case, it still looks good over 70 years later on DVD. In fact, how beautiful it is surprising. <br /> <br /> Congratulations for this to go to director Richard Boleslowski, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and, for DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. All of them joined together to give us one of the most beautiful films of the classical age. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. In the end he gave a nice message, although many people might not be happy with it. I can't say more without ruining things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I don't think, and certainly never played such a tender character ("Domini Enfilden"). The Charles Boyer heartthrob was the male star and the object of affection of Domini, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch"; John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner"; The most memorable, at least for me, was the dancer "Irena", played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there's a face and a dance you won't soon forget! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of movies I've seen. Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. Looking at her resume in IMDb, she was only in four films, but they were all well-known films. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who became famous for playing "Sherlock Holmes", is also here as is C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his time. Schildkraut, among other things, will be recognized by classic cinema fans as the man who played the arrogant big-time salesman "The Shop Around The Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, the photography and the color, and the dance of Tilly, are the things that I will remember better than this film that is a lot of good and not-good things all gathered in one. If the last half hour had been better - even if I admire the final - I would have rated it even higher. He is definitely a movie collector who wants to add to his collection.
