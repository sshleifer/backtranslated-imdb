This is a straight-to-video movie, so it's obvious that it won't be able to rival the first Lion King, but having said that, it was definitely good. <br /> <br /> My children loved this, but as a matter of fact, they love everything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that I * liked it too, it was fun to laugh at some parts (even the jokes of the farts *), it had a lot of pretty creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being as shy as in Shrek ["do you think I'm compensating for something?"]). <br /> <br /> A special note about the farts, I was surprised to find that none of the lines were just toilet sounds (in fact there were almost no noises / images, the references were actually rather thin) , actually they had a setup / punchline / etc, and they were almost tasteful. I would like my children to think that there is more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this film is fine with regards to it. <br /> <br /> Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not as creative as in the first or second film, but very fun for the children. No painfully trivial moment, which was a blessing for me. A small action but nothing too scary (the secret of NIMH gave my children nightmares, I'm not sure that a G grade was appropriate for that ...) <br /> <br /> All in all I would say it's a great films for children of all ages, one 100% sure to make them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive but I had to jump on and off the TV during some movies that were less suitable for children than expected) - but are you sure to leave the room during this. However, I would say to be around anyway, you may find that you like it too :)
