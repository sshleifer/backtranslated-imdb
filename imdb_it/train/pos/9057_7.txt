Let's be simple: my two children have been glued to this film. He has his faults from an adult perspective, but buy some gelatinous and simply enjoy them. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty damn sexy, even if it's not much in the movie, so don't overdo it. <br /> <br /> It's not really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you only watch once. Don't buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (This was for the dads.)
