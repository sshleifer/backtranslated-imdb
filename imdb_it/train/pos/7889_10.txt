The movie Freddy's Last Nightmare is just as horrible and disturbing as all the other Nightmare on Elm Street, yes it has the essence of comedy, so it has all the other films, but how can you say that you can't find Freddy Krueger scary , if you were to meet this man in your dreams you wouldn't find it even scarier with a comic essence about him because his play proves that he doesn't care about killing you he finds it extremely funny, and Freddy also plays mind games comedy with them, which in its own way is very disturbing, using its comic modes I think it makes horror films Nightmare on elm street what they are today, Writers are extremely smart making Krueger comical and scary as opposed to Jason Vorhees, who does not says nothing and does not have the intelligence to really frighten its victims, this film is as good as Freddy's spirit and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and manner "Not for dormentarsi! ".
