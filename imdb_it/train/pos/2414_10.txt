Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday night dramas shown. I ask the writer to write a long series and broadcast it on Lifetime, SOON. Each person was very interesting and did a great job with their lines to make the plot become reality. However, the film must continue for a long time. I would like to see Bianca and Jake's daughter grow up and get an important role in the film, along with the new grandparents who plan her educational future. In addition, he brings Kathy back to see her niece and helps promote her life. It was nice to see the grandparents solve their problems, but the family business needed to be brought back to work, and we see how Jake and Bianca survive through the marriage years.
