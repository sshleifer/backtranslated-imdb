To have a friend who is currently in a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. Obviously the SOB is very beautiful, fascinating, etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching the character of Jean Pierre Leaud at work is exactly like watching what happens in real life when kids like them destroy the lives of our friends. It's tragic, and you know it will end very badly, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty A void in everything, pulls the faces and tells the stories that he thinks will get the reaction he wants. <br /> <br /> The scene two hours in which Leaud and Lebrun made love, and the next morning puts on a recording and, with much sweetness and charm, sings together to amuse it is brilliant. The expression "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" flickering back and forth on his face will be in my memory for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but watch it at once, preferably in a movie theater. It takes a while to enter, but then time disappears.
