First of all I need to say that I am Portuguese and that it is not normal to spend my time watching Portuguese films, probably one every year or even nobody ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is almost generalized idea among the Portuguese people that the national images are horrible, really close to the worst ever done! However, in the last decade, it surprises me when we take up the funny 40s when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best worlds of their time, with films like "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula" , both by director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common. <br /> <br /> This is also good, not of the same type because it is not a real comedy; in fact it is officially a drama, a woman's drama has some unexpected fun parts, cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, like the hypothetical journey to the Caribbean just to fuck. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us a couple of times; the actors are fine, the places are as regular as the score; but the truth is that everything makes sense, so we can consider it a good effort for national cinema, which seems to be starting from the ashes like the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Portuguese Film, surely you can take a better option, but it is still to be measured.
