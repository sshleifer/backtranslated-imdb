This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrait of the world lived in the mind of a playboy. While I found the world to be morally repugnant, the film did better than what the narrative should do, and this brings us through an experience that we would never otherwise undergo. Tim Meadows portrays Leon Phelps so convincingly, and the story has so attracted me to the reckless world of Leon, who for a moment forgot that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel. Here lies the ruin of the film, because its great and bold success in storytelling comes at the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of viewers will only respond to the story of this film lying on the surface and rejecting that story, I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that I loved it. I loved him not only for his fascinating insights into the deluded mind of the playboy, not only for his amusing portrayal of the idiocy of human sexual desire, but also for his courage to explore without fear what is in the shadow of the heterosexuality. Besides, it's just fun.
