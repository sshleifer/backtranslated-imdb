let me say that I adore Adam Sandler, while watching the kingdom on myself I was paying close attention to his acting <br /> <br /> when he raises his voice, I can't help but think of a cheerful gilmore screaming at a golf ball, so shot like Adam Sandler disgusts me <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a film that comes off slowly at first with you expecting emotions in every scene <br / > <br /> Don Cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some really great lines and is worthy of an Oscar in every movie he does <br /> <br /> adam sandler has been fantastic in so many ways not only was his most dramatic film / best acting film of his career. but I can remember laughing aloud in many parts of this movie <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was also fantastic with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie tremendous recite beautiful shots of the great drama of New York And a new respect for Adam Sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance about how great Don Cheadle is
