Kolchak is pure entertainment. Great stories and an exceptional cast and nothing else to weigh it down. Darren McGavin offers an energetic performance that attracts the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support that most major players can only dream of having. Some excellent guest stars add color and verve to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how a childhood spent watching Kolchak lead Chris Carter to create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
