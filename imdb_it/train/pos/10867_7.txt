I saw in the guide the list of films for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this film was in projection. Basically there is an election for the new president of the Triad of Hong Kong Wo Sing Society, so you can imagine how much violence will occur during this. The fight is between the "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for controlling the oldest and most powerful parts of society. He also played Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good themes and moments of realistic corruption, just a sufficient number of actions, except perhaps when the cops are involved, but a sequel followed, so it's a very interesting dramatic thriller. Very good!
