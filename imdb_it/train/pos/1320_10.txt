In the early 1970s, Clifford Irving proposed writing the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming he had spent months preparing the book, engaged in interviews with the lonely millionaire. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (although he always admitted that his findings were accurate). Flash forward to 20001, a few months before September 11th, a book entitled "Forbidden Love" (published in the United States as "Honor Lost: love and death on the modern day Jordan") by a previously unknown author by the name of Norma Khouri , a Jordanian woman, who denounced the death by merciful murder of her best friend Dalia, due to the fact that Dalia, being of devout Muslim origin, attended a Christian man. This, like Irving's biography on Hughes, was revealed as a potential joke. The Australian filmmaker, Anna Broinowski, tries to dig into the quagmire that was Khouri's attempt to break free from lies. Within 104 minutes, does the film attempt to reveal that Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just a compulsive liar, with an agenda / revenge? Video interview with those who know / know her (including an ex-husband, her publisher and others) tell their version of the story. This is an amazing and well-made documentary that manages to pin many fingers on as many potential culprits. Not classified, but it contains a pervasive language and a re-enactment of the macabre crime scene, performed several times (but nothing as graphic or disturbing as what one would see in the last epic of porn torture, like Saw: Part 84). It is not a good choice for the little ones.
