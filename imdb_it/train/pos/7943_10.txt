I love this TV series so much. contains an interesting and beautiful animation. I can't believe they cut him off the TV, and even that I never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the BEST TV show ever. I know it's late to hope they start the show again, so I'm really glad I saw it. I discovered it BOTH <3 <br /> <br /> about a woman with the name of cybersix, she is not human. He goes to adrian sieldman, a man's teacher in a high school. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she is only disguised as a man during the day. At night cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A man named Von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and when he finds out that he is alive he uses everything he can to capture her. <Br /> <br /> If you have never looked at it before you should download it completely. It was the best television program in the world. Why did they cut it ???? some people have problems. but I'm glad I saw the 13 episodes.
