I just watched this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival, and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and credible interaction between the cast, and even great comic moments. <br /> <br /> This film touches on themes of universal family and separation. As a result, I can see the European, Asian and American public finding points of similarity between this film and their lives. <br /> <br /> If all this were not enough, this could be the potential best underground movie of the year ... someone will distribute it in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It's really a great movie.
