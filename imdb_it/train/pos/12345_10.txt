Kurosawa weaves a story that has a cast of different characters like any Shakespearean drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing the part of a part of the larger story. It is moving, fun and intriguing in all parts. The character development is almost perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story attracts you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "freak Samurai" and those obsessed by the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Japan's stories could snub this film as Kurosawa's best work. Maybe it's not the best, but even in the worst case scenario, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based on raising the banal lives of ordinary people in a period of great change, which is timeless, despite being set in a not too distant past. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this to any film lover, and in particular to those who will probably continue to read the novel on which the film is based.
