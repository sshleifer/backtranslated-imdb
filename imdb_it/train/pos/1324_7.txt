You sit there for half an hour and watch a story, believing everything, then watch another half hour of the same story completely destructive ... and then put it back together. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting films of the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I don't know if - in addition to "Capturing the Friedmans" by Andrew Jarecki - there was ever anything like "Forbidden Lie $" by Anna Broinowski. Presents, exhibits, defends, reveals and questions everything about Norma Khouri, author of "Honor Lost", the acclaimed 2001 best seller on honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this "exposition" of Khouri is made with the full participation of Khouri. <br /> <br /> For the opening part of the film, Khouri presents his story about the alleged murder of a friend of his in Amman, the story of the book. It seems completely credible, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then his story is dismantled, exposed by eminently credible and convincing people, such as activists for women's rights in Jordan, investigative journalists there and in Australia, where Khouri lived for a while time. <br /> <br /> Khouri comes back and denies the charges, successfully completing a lie detector test. Another segment of devastating exhibits arrives - not to be specified here because this would reduce the value of shock ... and then Khouri turns back and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential ones regarding the book). <Br /> <br /> And Houdini's act continues, with round after round, in this heavy and swinging prize fight, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. Brilliant.
