IQ is a cute romantic comedy with two great actors who seem to click well on the screen. The plot is a typical boy wrong for the girl, the boy is a girl, but he makes the solid point that we must love with the heart and not with the mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his band of genes offers excellent comic relief. Overall, a good movie. Not great, but good
