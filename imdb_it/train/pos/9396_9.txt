In each number of films, Nicholas Cage is a strong and silent hero, Dennis Hopper in the role of a homicidal maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle in the role of a vamp / vagabond, and the late J.T. Walsh like the heavy. These are the types of roles that these four can play in their sleep, and they did it often enough to see them playing the cliche again. What a relief, then, that John Dahl, a master of bringing out a lot of humor from a small action, directed this noir thriller. Hopper manages not to exaggerate, Cage shows a little more depth than his usually superficial heroes of action, Boyle is in turn sensual, innocent and intriguing, and he has the feeling of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character , Wayne. Dahl's direction gives meaning to the void of the Big Sky country in which the story takes place, even though it is intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can indicate a radical plot change in store. The twists and turns are of a high standard, and one of the other great twists in this film is that some of the supporting characters actually behave as if they had a brain. It is not often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their superiors. But with an intelligent director like Dahl, you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this movie. An excellent film.
