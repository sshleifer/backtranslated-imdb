I never seem to write a review on IMDb unless I'm extremely surprised how good or bad a movie is. This film falls into the first category. Every year I try to see all the nominees for the best foreign film at the Oscars, even those I know I won't like. "As It Is In Heaven" seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds sugary, sentimental and slow .... For my taste, they are more oriented towards original foreign cinema, obscure and / or daring (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, A lot of modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "As It Is In Heaven "doesn't seem particularly interesting ... It wasn't released in the United States, so I sat down to watch a VCD that I found in Singapore, preparing to" delete it from the list ". After a boring start, "As It Is In Heaven" becomes that rare movie in which you are really inspired by what is happening on the screen. Weaknesses: the characters of the film are pure "reserve" characters: the wounded Dreamer, the city Bully, the battered wife, the desperate woman for love, the repressed minister .... Fortunately, they are mostly a nice group, besides being well written and well acted. Ingela Olsson, like Minister Inger's wife, would have been nominated for an Oscar if her performance had been in English. Strong points: the music is beautiful and the main song, sung by Gabriella, is really dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye on the exuberant eighty-year-old actress who plays Olga, who is keeping pace with the dancers and younger girls! I will not discuss the end, but I will say that it makes sense. It's a lot of emotional things that happen in the last hour of the movie, and you're not entirely sure why they're happening. Even if nothing is explained in words, everything makes sense because the films reach an adequate crescendo. **** outside *****. Probably the strongest Swedish film I've ever seen.
