"Everything depends on you, Ed?" "Now you can play." The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this movie with his new girlfriend, the day of the inauguration at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen. I wasn't even entirely sure what I was seeing, but I'll never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> Looking at him today, thirty-six years later, he still gives me the quivers. <br /> <br /> My father was a big fan of Burt Reynolds, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour to see what was supposed to be an "action movie". I saw two films at the Duomo before this: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". Well, this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at that tender age, I appreciated the artistry ... and after seeing it again today, I am surprised that I was still standing after witnessing this disturbing movie, but extremely well done. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old girl who still had to kiss her first girlfriend. I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a little too much for a child to witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it rather disturbing, yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film. Burt Reynolds is an absolute wonder, as are all the principles ... from Billy Redden as the wonder of the innate guitar, to Ronny Cox as the terrifying insurance salesman ... everyone does an admirable job Sound quality is not second to none, from chirping birds to mint watches. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this extraordinary film are of first quality. <br /> <br /> The moral issues raised, from the murder of sex offenders to the consequences of the murder of a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this revolutionary film was released. And the classic sequences of trying to survive in the wild after facing such unexpected brutality are life alternating. These four men, men of the city, have suddenly faced a situation that they never imagined, they raise the level from action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic to be sure. And the phrase "you have a beautiful mouth" has been mentioned endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to the gaping comments about the water cooler at work, this film is undoubtedly an important part of our pop culture of society .. as much as "Make my day" or "I'll be back" have always been. <br /> <br /> So what would YOU do if you found out that your friends were sexually assaulted by mountain men far from your life? in the city, cozy bed, wife and children? And if you had taken the steps that Burt Reynolds did (and I would have done the same), would you bury the body under the lake early, or take the process and seize your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance offers. You can take it to the bank. If this film is not put on your skin, then you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen it before, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film remains the same: And failing to kill the deer ... then changing. Life and unpredictable circumstances can change a man. And I suppose this is the film about Jon Voight, in particular, like Ed, offers the best performances here. And he remains one of the most gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his very underrated performance by Franklin D. Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor, his acting raises the film to another level. Climbing on the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to do it well. It must be seen to be believed. I guarantee that your heart rate will reach a new level. <br /> <br /> Determined, tense, tense and well designed like a banjo string, this is a game of morality that asks questions that remain today. Times have changes, but our choices as human beings are not. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
