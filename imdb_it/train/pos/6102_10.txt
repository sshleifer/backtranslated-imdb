I had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many movies projected to the black audience failed badly. This film lacked all the clich√©s of the videos, and even blew through the gangsters, the rappers and the vulgar language. He examined various relationships between doctors, African Americans and romantic African American male / female relationships on a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed by the careful movie mix of light humor with some rather difficult and heavy problems. The film will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I also saw him at the Boston Film Festival. It was premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this film reaches a much wider audience. Blacks (and EVERYONE else) would love a movie like this - if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there! <br /> <br /> As an extra - if you are a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premeditated student, married to a doctor, a doctor's little brother, a family doctor or an excellent doctoral period, too they would love this movie. He represented residence and practice in a realistic way that was highly appreciated by doctors, residents and medical students who saw the film. Dennis Cooper completely resides in internal medicine - so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and this is very obvious.
