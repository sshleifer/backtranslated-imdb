"Atlantis" is a new and fair step for a Disney movie. It is a good choice to make a film with a legend as mysterious as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this film, but after seeing it, I don't understand why this film had such bad reviews. Also in my country the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but it is still one of the biggest at Disney, although I doubt that this film will always have the reputation of "Disney classic". Well, this is another case. It's funny to think that this science fiction movie was directed by the same directors of "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to escape from their reputation in the monsters movies, he he, I "am just kidding.) <br /> <br /> Well, enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is a watchable, exciting and very funny movie. This movie is also a PG action movie, it's also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, he). <br /> <br /> the story is a little predictable, but it doesn't ruin the film. Animation inspired by comics is suitable for the film and set is a novelty compared to the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. The sequences of Deep Canvas are quite impressive. The film is also funny at times, even I more ridiculous than laughing through the film. (SPOILERS) The characters in this film are also very nice, but sfort there is not enough time to know everyone, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of James Newton Howard is absolutely fantastic. It is bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this film is the way they make the sound of Atlantis very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really great (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some questions left unanswered in the story. But fortunately there are not so many. <br /> <br /> So you're a favor to yourself, don't listen to the reviewers and watch "Atlantis", because it's waiting for you ...
