"I didn't want this to get complicated, Leese, I have to assume that he will read it." Fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this action thriller. A night flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes her place-mate (Cillian Murphy) intends to use her as part of a chilling murder plot. As the minutes pass, she is in a race against time to warn potential victims before it is too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my best favorite actors. For example, the first scenes at the airport sound more like a romantic comedy: two people continue to run with each other ... I have to deliver them to the two too, to make a film like this. Above all, the character of Murphy .. Jackson, who really seems to be a little complicated in that way that acts in a charming and innocent way, yet he's trying to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in certain parts he really seems to be worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A beautiful thrilling ride to the hilt. A lot of movies I'd hate to see a prequel or a sequel, but I really wouldn't mind a prequel to this, which would take place with Jackson watching Lisa. The favorite scene is probably that headline scene, because it was so unexpected. There was also a nice accumulation in the famous "pen" scene. When will he make his move? There was also that beautiful change in McAdam's Lisa, where she had turned from victim to counterattack. I also loved the scene in which he sits in the food court and pretends to ask some women for a food court survey. How great was Murphy with all his weezing .....
