David Aames is a good-looking guy who lives in New York City. When his 'sleeping partner' Julie Gianni becomes very jealous after David falls in love with the Spanish beauty Sofia, he takes David in his car and tells him that he is the only guy he loves and wants to stay with, but since he is in love with Sofia decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, driving from a bridge. David survives the accident, but remains with a disfigured face. He is then accused of Julie's murder. The fact is that David doesn't know what's real and what's not since he continues to make these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which make no sense to him. Everything will soon return to him even if he begins to discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there's a cast of all the stars here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all perform well in the film. In the film, everyone staged different things about those characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Really good. There is also a cameo in the brilliant Steven Spielberg's film. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-made, different, interesting and original film that will let you talk long after you finish it. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. The movie trailer is really good, but the film is so different from how it could be made. It was very well directed and there were also a couple of really cool scenes. All in all, a funny film that should really be the subject of attention. Certainly they are making many films recently "They are dead, if they are not dead".
