I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of "family" movies these days. Many of them, IMHO, are disgusting sentimental. But this, like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar movie, is a lot of fun. The two protagonists were perhaps a bit too bland (especially compared to the two protagonists of ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it. The animation was fantastic, the humor, although ample, was definitely good (I particularly liked Hopper's phrase "If I had not promised my mother she would kill you on her death bed, I would have killed you!" And the actors making the voices, except the two protagonists, were all fantastic (Denis Leary makes an animated film, what a concept). And like everyone, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has new ones.
