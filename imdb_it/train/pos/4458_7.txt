This has some excellent points but the length of the film cannot support the thin texture of the wafer. They are other sailors on license, zippier of "Follow the fleet" of Astaire, but not up to "On The Town". <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is bland, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their issue "If you Knew Susie" is hilarious as they prepare the song as they sing it. 'I Begged Her' is also fun with Sinatra showing how skilled he is in the hoof. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and seem to be inserted to show his singing rather than part of the story. Fortunately there are successful actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impregnable Jose Iturbi like him to keep one watching. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the protagonist of the film, even if it is the third turnover, and it is interesting to see it interact with children, something that Astaire has never done. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and clings to the character of Kelly. He also visited a school, with the result that he told the children a fictitious story of his life in the pomeranian marina (!) That leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely serious little girl, Sharon McManus, who is lovely and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant, but a little too long. A taste of the best musicals to come.
