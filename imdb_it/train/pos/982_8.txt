This is one of those westerns that, well, is practically alone in the incredible quality of its dialogue. Very few manage to resist in the long run. That being said, the rest is pretty ugly. Nevertheless, I'm giving him an eighth because there is no other western with such consistently good dialogue with perhaps the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and maybe some others. <br /> <br /> It's full of weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore the most resounding. However it has a really memorable scene. Nothing of the kind It's right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to Jack Elams' place trying to make him fight. Wonderful stuff Finished with the best in every westerner.
