This film took a long time. He was criticized by critics when he came out and was accused of destroying Nicolas Cage's career. The thing that I don't think derives from people is that it's not meant to be an epic, the contender for a film Oscar, it's just a brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best. Fast machines, quick editing and an exceptional soundtrack: it does exactly what it says on the tin. Moreover, for those who love cars it is a real pleasure. He's got it all: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and don't forget Eleanor! I think you would be very pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie altogether !! Then again maybe it's just me!
