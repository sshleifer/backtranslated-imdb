This is by far one of my favorite American spin-offs, especially because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic. <br /> <br /> For example AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage boy surrounded by naked college chicks, and he has one in particular on his trail to free him from his "problem" of virginity and ends up stopping halfway and riding a horse to sleep with his girlfriend, which he continues in mind gave him a "free pass for the blame" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but we are realistic; most people who are watching these films are not particularly looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the most recent version seems to finally understand who the public is and the good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the rose and as always Mr. Levenstein lends his "perfectly natural" eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
