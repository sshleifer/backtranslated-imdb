This film is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices for animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the impertinent feline and the young inexperienced poet, but the real protagonist is Don Ameche as the old and faithful golden retriever. This film is a great family film because it can be appreciated and loved by children and adults. Humorous and full of suspense, and guaranteed to make any animal lover cry! (tears of joy!)
