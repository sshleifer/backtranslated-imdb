Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of Poirot's best books, as it is very disturbing and has a brilliant ending. There is no doubt that television adaptation is visually striking, with some pleasant photographs and a very haunting soundtrack. As always David Suchet is as impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the climax of the play is the battle of Poirot with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as good as the rather naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turns into decent performances, but be careful not to obscure the two leads, a danger in some Christie adaptations. Part of the episode was rather disturbing, a juxtaposition of a tragic episode like Five Little Pigs, an episode that I liked a lot more than that. What made it particularly disturbing, putting music aside, was when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. Regarding adaptation, he was quite faithful to the book, but I'll say that there were three things I didn't like. The main problem was the rhythm, it is quite slow, and there are some scenes in which it happens very little. I didn't even like the fact that I made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a murderer, and his underdevelopment, have made him a less attractive character, although I'm glad they didn't lose his drug addiction. (I also noticed that the writers omitted the fact that Mrs. Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she thinks she is the next victim of the murderer.) The other thing that was not so impressive is that I heard it could be more effective if the adaptation had been in Amy Leatheran's perspective, as it was in the book, Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in adaptation. Overall, despite some errors of judgment in favor of writers, I liked the murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
