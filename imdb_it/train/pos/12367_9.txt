Well, after a long wait after seeing some clips on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I had waited a long time to see this movie. The plot was simple, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moved into a condominium that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a disturbing film at the bottom right, even if it is a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The acting is fine, and there are some really disturbing pieces like the clumsy orgy with the dead father and the fat woman in the middle of the orgy that eats the cake and laughing. The ending is a strange mixture of deformed and cannibal people. It's very strange, camped but in the end, I really think it's a great movie! One of my favorites since the 70s, even if it's nothing original. It's extravagant and extremely scary! Probably one of my favorites of all time. 9/10
