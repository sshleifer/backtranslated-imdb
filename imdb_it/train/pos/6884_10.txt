This miracle of a film is one of those films that has a long-term lasting effect on you. I read a review or two of angry people that I imagine are either Republicans or children, and their extremist remarks speak of the power of the film to confront people with their darkest secrets. None of these works of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and this is the miracle of the film. The film's realism and its interpretation of Bret Carr are unmissable. The very nature of its almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater free or question its own identity. Bravo at the next level of cinema.
