* Wonderland SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) is attacked while sleeping and brutally hit in the head with steel tubes in their home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. <br /> Main Suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a 30 cm long cock, and now a hopeless drug addict. <br /> <br /> Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating the case and trying to solve it with the help of a witness who claims to know that John took part at least to the murders, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's boyfriend, and is trying to get a witness from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holmes's 19-year-old girl and Susan, who unfortunately remembers nothing more than the shadows of the night when her husband's head was hit and his almost immediately the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), an important drug boss (who is always close to ladies like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes to light as a suspicious planner of the Wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, could you know anything about it? 'Wonderland' is an intense and educated thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a man's sad decline in one; there is an intelligent use of the 'Rashomon' technique (we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (although very briefly) and Sharon), good direction and a fantastic script, but is mostly irresistible for performances, especially Kilmer's, who occupies a central place with his desperate, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas', whose Launius is strangely seductive, Kudrow's strong Sharon and the innocent Dawn of Bosworth. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
