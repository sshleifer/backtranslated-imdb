I just used this video and was watching it last night. The acting started extremely badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister) but it became very good right after the departments. The pylons seemed extremely fake and many of the CGI effects were very risky, but the scene with the house breaking apart and the contents inside being blown up and sucked out were extremely well done, and almost on a par with films like Twister. Even the devastation scenes were done very well. The story was very well written, and it's nice to see a movie like this far from the same old "disaster formulas" of this kind seems to have been stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> While this the film had a very strange mix of FX and acting qualities, this deserves an A in my book.
