Probably the most fanciful part of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are cut without ambition, but there's no denying that they threw everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this a fun episode. Kirk and the crew seem to have found the perfect planet for the leave from the ground after a long tour of duty that left everyone on board in search of rest, relaxation and so on. It seems in effect to be an uninhabited land, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. The first indication that things could go just a little crooked is when McCoy, who leads an early team, sees Alice (from Wonderland) following a big white rabbit wearing a jacket. Kirk straightens up and finds the others telling about equally bizarre events and encounters. The only thing they have in common is that every crew member was thinking about the person / place / thing he discovered just before they found out. This doesn't immediately sink with Kirk or anyone else. The result is an oddity, including sightings of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WWII fighter plane, etc .; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (obviously) and a bully since the days of the Academy, Finnegan. The chase / fight scene with Finnegan lasts too long, but at the same time, McCoy is hit by a spear by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. Eventually an old man appears explaining what is happening. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors just have to imagine something to make it appear. Nothing is definitive; McCoy isn't really dead. Once this has been explained, Kirk decides to order the land leave for everyone, after all. Despite the end of the film "it was all a dream", "Shore Leave" represents another prominent episode of the first season of Star Trek.
