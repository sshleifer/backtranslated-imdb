My husband and I enjoy The DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby. We bought DVDs and CDs from him just to watch them and listen to them yourself. They are fun, energetic and very funny. They encourage children to be active, share and care. They always have a positive message and fun entertainment. Every time our son listens to the theme song, he quickly turns his head towards the television and starts bouncing up and down with excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You can't help but smile and want to dance when you feel it.
