An angry boy who tragically lost his parents is assisted by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in Gaelic folk tales that have been handed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although the tragic episodes, like the Highland spaces, are present in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and joy in them. It's all shot in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking and is a rare opportunity to hear spoken Scottish Gaelic. I'm English, so I had to read subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is still wonderful. Performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you're looking at the real thing - people who care about folklore and Gaelic history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, has performed countless miracles to make this film. Anyone with the slightest interest in Gaelic, popular history, popular music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should go and see this film.
