I'm probably one of the biggest Nancy Drew fans out there. I read every book three times and played many of the games designed by Nancy. I loved this movie. He entertained you the whole time you looked at him. I went with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved it. There were three women sitting behind us who seemed to be between 30 and 40 and I asked them how they liked it, they said they loved it! So see that it will be fun for all ages. You just have to give it a chance. It also teaches a lesson, be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly the same. So overall, this move was great. I'm going to see it a second time now! So stop beating him please. It's a really good movie!
