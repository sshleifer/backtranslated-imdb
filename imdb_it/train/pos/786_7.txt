Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are again great in this film. When you enter quarantine and you are alone for a while (or for a lifetime), you can feel that you are wasting. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found everywhere, if your antennas are acutely active. I liked the rapid sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). His former student is nice enough, he still has a crush on his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought rather unrealistic or impractical, though. For example, in a scene where the jealousy of other women takes precedence and a scene was created to make Andie MacDowell download the young man, a mature police officer (MacDowell's other friend) would allow his friend to do such a sinister act? Is it so easy for anyone not to stop in front of a car? Obviously accidents always happen, but I was hoping to see the heroine happily marrying with the first man she was involved with (it was the hardest part to believe !! For a woman so beautiful that she remained single for so long?) ... <br /> <br /> Maybe film producers are aware of the fact that many love stories between an old woman and a younger man do not last long. Next to them they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, particularly to women over 40, who are waiting for some miracles. The sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but what if the man continued to live, would it last? How long? Nobody knows. However, it is a film that makes you want to watch it again some time later .... maybe a year later.
