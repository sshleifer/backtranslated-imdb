JACKNIFE is a great adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's drama "Strange Snow" (the script was also written by Metcalfe), sensitively directed by David Hugh Jones, which explores the all too often forgotten effect of the battle on veterans permanently damaged by the hateful cruelty of war. It is particularly touching to return to this 1989 film as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the treatment they are receiving at our Veterans' Hospital. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two come back alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in battle, David's Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so badly damaged by the syndrome of post-traumatic stress that "exists" in a drunken void with her very simple sister of the teacher Martha (Kathy Baker). While David deteriorates his friend Joseph "Jacknife" Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city in an attempt to help his friend. During the events, Jacknife initially offers assistance to Martha and eventually the two appointments - a Prom Martha must participate - and at that drunken dance David opens wide, destroying the relics in the school and terrorizing citizens and students. Jacknife revives Dave the moment they lost their friend in Vietnam and by doing so brings David to the point where he can begin his climb to healing. And Martha, the suffering Martha, also found her needs. <br /> <br /> All three actors perform extraordinarily beautifully: Ed Harris offers one of his most complete roles while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers. A greater number of people should help to resurrect this almost forgotten film, since it is a fragile reminder of the damage that our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families that receive them after the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
