Freely understood as a satire of D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages, was Buster Keaton's first attempt to make a comedy feature. The only similarities with Intolerance are the opening "book" scene and the fact that similar stories through the centuries are assembled together in a complete film. Keaton's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if he had not been successful as a feature film, he could have been reduced to three two rolls. Fortunately, The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in one of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or daring in the stories. They are simple stories from boy-girl-girl, from boy-girl-from-girl, from girl-girls, but the vintage satires are tumultuous and represent the standard for the future works of Mel Brooks and all the movies of this type. However, I don't think anyone has ever passed this play. No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and the stunts in this film are among his best. Furthermore, the appearance of Wallace Beery as Keaton's rival adds to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks that the comedy of the 1920s cannot be appreciated by the modern public must see this film.
