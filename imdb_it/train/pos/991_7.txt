I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that touched this movie. This film was not meant to be a "deep thought" film, which is what the vast majority of reviewers seem to think should be. In fact, it would seem that if ANY film does not produce an intuition that alters life, and a deep, twisted and shocking plot, it would classify it as 1 or 2. Don't film a movie because you don't like the genre, the people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy movie, and that was all it had to be. And for an action / comedy, it was done very well. Actually, I was rather surprised that I enjoyed myself as much as I had never been a true Jamie Foxx fan, and that he had too much used plot. <br /> <br /> The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal goes out of prison and is thrown into the plot of a guy while trying to clean up his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc. . etc. etc.) but it was heated with a bit of a technological touch. Now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the TRUE "bad guy" is a super geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays convincingly, while at the same time he is rather intelligent and a serious main character, and he has not tried to overdo the humorous side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep background story like in "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of Topi e uomini", then this movie is not for you. But if you like raw actions, high-speed shooting and an occasional touch of humor, this movie won't disappoint you. Normally I would have rated it on an 8 (at the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead I gave it a 10 to try to score on what it SHOULD be. <br /> <br />
