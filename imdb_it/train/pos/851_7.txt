Pierce Brosnan has sipped his latest Martini and returns, in a shameless self-parody, to the elderly sacked-mouthed murderer Julian Noble, who has a particular fondness for teenagers, bullfights and sticky clothes. During a job in Mexico City he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a bold-faced Denver suburban businessman who is in town to do his part of life in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's raw and insensitive remarks, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Brought largely by performances by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he didn't write the film with Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can't imagine him without him. Prove you have a real talent for comedy and can be more than James Bond or spies of the cold war. The scene where the two meet in a polished hotel bar (beautiful sets and beautifully photographed) is really a acting skill. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and, although it has probably been carefully scripted, the two actors are mostly improvising, but they succeed wonderfully! It almost seems like a new standard in acting. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS who improvise and add one of the most subtle bases of many genre clich√©s and the typecasting of actors (especially Brosnan's James Bond), and you have one of the most delicious pairings of the recent Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story runs out after a while. After an hour, the film runs out. Nevertheless, and I can't say it exactly, I liked it a lot. It looks really fresh and original, with an imaginative use of sets and lights and a few hints of Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters are not given much to do, but this film offers something new, in this sense it almost effortlessly merges all conventional genres into a rather funny parody. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Darkroom --- 7/10
