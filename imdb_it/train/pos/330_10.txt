I am Italian and when I recently watched this film again, I was surprised by its beauty: the first time I was 10 and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the mind and feelings of adults. Now I understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.), now gone. <br /> <br /> Epic Hollywood movies are good ... for fun. Maybe this 'Odyssey' didn't have an English version because it's not funny enough ... not suitable for the popcorn and coke audience. However suitable for the pathos of Homer and for the existentialist reflections. <br /> <br /> A very good DVD version has recently been released in Italy: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but it's only Italian and without subtitles. Too bad: even the dialogues and the voices of this film are remarkable.
