The film "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones pushes the viewer on a journey of redemption as the main character takes control of the wheel and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found a creative and refreshing way to enhance his character and actualize what matters most. These truths become evident to both the characters and the spectators as you laugh and gag yourself in credits with them. Simple and attractive settings make you guess what you will see later. You can't help but smile and laugh at the antics taking place in this movie. I can't wait for his second year of effort. It's only a matter of time before Jones hits again. Good boy!
