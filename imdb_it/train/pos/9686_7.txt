A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It's about a little girl (with a vocal impediment) who treasures her green Paulie parrot. The parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is definitely the star of the film. At times mischievous and sometimes in crisis of depression the bird captures the mood in a more remarkable and expressive way. Even the synchronized voice is very well done and in a minute or two you can really believe that this intelligent bird exists. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film his father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of Paulie's constant struggle for many years to rejoin his lover. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people who use ATMs. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The ending is predictable, but who would want it differently. Kids will love this movie and anyone who keeps a bird like a pet will delight in Paulie's antics.
