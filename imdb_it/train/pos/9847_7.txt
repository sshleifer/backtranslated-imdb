I enjoyed watching this movie ... although I had most of the time, that this movie was almost copying Monsters Inc. There are some things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a child small, other animals trying to break that relationship, et cetera. I felt this way for the whole film, for me. <br /> <br /> One of the positive features, however, is Scrat :) Very funny character, even if it's no use :)
