We hope that the score has changed due to my brilliant and stunning review that convinces all of you to go and see the film thus creating an instant chorus of "8", the real score of this film. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is the king! Before going to see this film I was not so above him but now I'm slamming the doors of Chris Rock's site asking him to take me as his protégé. This movie is really fun, if you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it is humor that addresses all areas of society including race (predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, comedy .. the list goes on. <br /> <br /> There was a slight disappointment for me anyway. So it was that on entering this film I didn't realize that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait", another good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I saw this movie and suddenly the plot started to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had seen on TV a few weeks ago. Regardless of this film, in my opinion the best version is two of them simply because of the different areas covered and the fact that Chris Rock is more fun than Warren Beatty every second of any day of any week of any year of any ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Good for the film's plot. <br /> <br /> Don't ruin the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just go and see a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that are enthusiastic about it, go see it because it's the funniest thing you'd seen in a long time, go see it because it's a cinematic experience that won't let you grumble to the point of nauseating the cost of cinema tickets. Go see it because it's a good movie!
