When it comes to creating a universe, George Lucas is the undisputed master and his latest Star Wars film is very, very good (and rated more appropriately than the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this film into perspective. The final battle seems even more climatic, knowing what Anakin Skywalker passed into the Emperor's manipulative hands. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padm√© and the love he felt for his children. In reality while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films, they are good only for a reason. Make old movies even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this film. It really brings the changes that Luke has gone through seem real. In all honesty I think he should have become a great actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can hear that he made Raiders and Blade Runner between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedies (obviously inspired by the Raiders) to the brilliantly functioning character. In short, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher has never really been a good actress, but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and after seeing episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains of all time. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and is still very, very good. <br /> <br /> In terms of how the film seems safe enough to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than one of the previous two (two) films, but this has always been Lucas' fort, so it's really predictable. The final battle on Endor is very well done both in terms of general effects and tension. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to do three battles at the same time he added to the general tension of the climax. <br /> <br /> The only thing I feel is dragging the film from another deserved 9 is the Ewok. These little creatures are so annoying that they almost ruin every scene they find themselves in. I also find it a bit cloying when a group of bows with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and powerful machinery. <br /> <br /> All in all, Return of the Jedi is a great film, but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less experienced director than Irvin Kershner makes the overall feel of the film far from brilliant. George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe also means that the film is not brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
