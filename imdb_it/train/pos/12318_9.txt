Although I'm not the biggest fan of wirework-based martial arts movies, when a movie goes straight to fantasy rather than fight, I get a lot more fun and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic plot and flight crazy cheating. Ching Siu Tung has created an enchanting treatment here with excellent performance and a lot of ethereal beauty. The great and tragic Leslie Cheung plays a hero of the publican who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets caught up in an amazing fox spirit and an extravagant Taoist. Cheungs' performance is full of naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasantly off-the-wall as the Taoist monk, who exhibits some fencing and even gets a musical number. Perhaps the best thing is Joey Wang like the fox spirit, really a pleasure to contemplate with every seductive and seductive movement and gesture. The film contains elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all mixed together in a constantly fun package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and managing the choreography offers some thrilling thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and mysteriously exciting forest colors, giving each forest scene a wonderfully fascinating atmosphere. Also noteworthy are the elaborate hairstyles and the splendid flowing garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang who sometimes wears hair like fox ears, sometimes, a wonderful touch. Although the film has a bit of action and some sometimes ill-advised pop songs, this is a nice piece of entertainment, with cool characters and conspiracies, even the strange bow of the character, an almost constant supply of visual tricks and atmosphere copious oneiric. An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
