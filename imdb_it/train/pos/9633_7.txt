In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable short L & H on the surface with the guys going to sweep someone's chimney. Guess what will happen next?

Ollie for example is very unlikely, he is arrogant, he is rude, and not just for Stan he looks at the way he addresses the servant with "HEY YOU" and easily takes a childish infatuation with his slogan "I have nothing to say". In short Ollie plays a bully in a very unlikely way and I much prefer to see him play the arrogant coward where he is always at his funniest DIRECT WORK even he misses the regular patrons of the other L & H short films like Finlayson, Long , Busch and Housman, which means that when we switch to the mad scientist plot there is a slightly eerie atmosphere that fills the rest of the film <br /> <br /> Having said that this is still a good short film mainly down to Stan. Pay attention to a scene with a fish. Many beats / textures from L & H present fish and this is another
