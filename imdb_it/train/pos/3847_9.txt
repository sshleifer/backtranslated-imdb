In his time, this film has had controversy over all this (like most of Verhoeven's projects). <br /> <br /> Containing scenes very representative of scenes of death; A parachute that does not open * slaps * body of boys on the floor. A boy who is eaten by a lion * chomp * teeth in the throat. And a boy is hit by a motorboat * zoom * bloody corpse that goes down. <br /> <br /> But besides the gore, this film also contains brilliant (and incredibly beautiful) scenes, filmed in the gray fishing town of Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the film, a beautiful (holy) woman who puts flowers in a can of milk, surrounded by slabs of dripping meat of blood and a smoldering love scene between two male characters, in a cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story ends in a frantic, but rewarding 10 minutes, which will not disappoint, and will leave a sigh of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course the disadvantages come with the professionals, some special effects are too exaggerated, and are obviously made to see to what extent Verhoeven could push the gore factor (for example the various eyeballs hanging out of their sockets ). Moreover, while the two main actors, (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk), do a great job in giving life to their characters, the character of Herman (played by the rather unattractive Thom Hoffman) feels enormously underdeveloped, making it hard to look after , even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I did my best to give you an idea of ​​what to expect from this fantastic film and, as you can see, it's not easy to summarize it in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
