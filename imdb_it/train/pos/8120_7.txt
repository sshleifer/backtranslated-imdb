Things to Come is a science fiction film that shows an imaginary world, or "Everytown" through 100 years. You can split it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film extends from 1940 to 2036 and mainly concerns the way in which this sovereign or "Boss" wanted to resume the ability to fly by plane, after Everytown had been bombed and war broke out. <br /> <br /> Only this film has about 3 flaws: the sound is muddy and the video has some quirks, the characters are not at all deep and the general plot is not entirely solid. The plot lacks something I can't point to ... it just seems a little "soft". But if you love science fiction and are interested in what H.G. Wells could happen in the next hundred years, it's a must see. It is worth seeing only to know what everyone feared: a long and hard war, because they were going to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to How is a rather beautiful film that most people need to see once.
