First of all I was totally taken aback by the initial lyricism of the film and then I was totally enchanted by the story that was unfolding and absorbed by the brilliant direction. The characters were all fully developed, not bigger than life but just like the people we live in anywhere in the world, in Sweden, Turkey or America, all completely credible human beings with weakness and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful movie. Show that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clearly and brilliantly, and this shows the genius of the director! Many thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treatment !!
