I saw this film for the first time about 20 years ago and I never forgot it. It is beautifully filmed and the story continues to be riveted all the time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946, as the fable is still fresh today and really does reflect. I'm not very informed about the technique of the film, however the special effects in this film are fantastic considering when it was done. Furthermore, the acting is superb and the use of British and American actors is quite surprising. I recently bought the DVD, so now I can watch it when I want to. I highly recommend anyone interested in British post-war films to see it.
