Entering this film, I had heard positive things about it. Coming out, I wasn't really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character, just like his other films. There were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie are when he dances in the club scene. I absolutely have to try it the next time I'm in a club. A couple of stars here and there including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that girl from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite amusing to see a cameo by Thandie Newton in a scene. Obviously it's in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a disaster, or you'll like it or you'll find it a bit boring. I could add that Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
