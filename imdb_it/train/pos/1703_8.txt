Being myself from a small Illinois town, I can immediately relate to this film. Considering the era in which it was created, citizens seem as uncomfortable as many people I grew up with. Yes, the plot is so-so. And yes, acting will not be nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But this is not the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN. And this movie has a lot of fun. From the greedy, disinterested banker to the well-intentioned but spoiled non-commissioned officer, this film was created to make fun of the SciFi genre and the small city that lives to the fullest. Who can't smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I loved the FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I was growing up. Overall, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a pleasant chat in their childhood, when you could sit on Saturday afternoon, Popcorn in hand, and laugh at the weaknesses of living in a small town. This is a film I would watch again and again, if only to make fun of myself and my small towns.
