Actually a particular person / character is not "right there", but my summary line refers to the power of the film. And all this was achieved without imaginative moves and / or large production sets, but with a great story and (credible) and good actors that tell the story (arc). <br /> <br /> You could call it a piece to accompany great Japanese movies / cinemas (like Tokyo Story, etc.), not so much on the side of the story, but more on the mood! Great acting, nuances in performances that are really gems. If you are eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touch you emotionally, then this is the only one to follow. As you've noticed (as with many of my reviews), I'm not going into history. There are places here in the IMDb where you can look up the top ones, I'm not the one to ruin the story!
