At first glance I expected this film to be lousy because I thought the plot would be overly feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in previous published comments, I agree that the feminist part in this film doesn't bother. I never had the idea that the protagonist had exaggerated his position as a woman. It is as if Guzman was presented as someone with a backbone, this in contrast to his classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable end. Perhaps it would have been a good idea to give the plot a radical turn, so that the viewer was a little more surprised. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd like to say that Rodriguez earned his respect for the way he put his character aside. I can't explain why, but above all in the love scenes he convinced me. It seemed real, I think. <br /> <br /> I gave a 7 out of 10, simply because of the boring last half hour.
