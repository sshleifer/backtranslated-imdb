I saw this film criticized with the phrase: "If you can overcome moralism ...". Moral is in the conscience of the beholder, so to speak. This is a decent film with a mysterious standard murder, but with a clear distinction that emerges halfway. The resolution leaves the viewer wondering, "What would I do in this position?" And I have to believe that this is exactly what the filmmaker intended. To this end, and to the end of entertaining the public, the film is successful. I also like the way violence is never on stage, but just outside the camera. We know what just happened; it has not only served in front of us, so it has rubbed itself in the face, as it would be today with blood and contemporary blood dressing. Furthermore, violence is not the point. The point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, who is intelligently, even if disturbed, solved.
