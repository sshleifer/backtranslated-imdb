This is the best film version of Dicken's classic story. I've seen it over and over again on VHS and recently bought the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not wide screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of British actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "The Equalizer", as the Ghost of Christmas Present.
