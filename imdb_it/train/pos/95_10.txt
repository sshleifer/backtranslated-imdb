yes I have a copy on VHS uncut in very good condition that I transferred to DVD and if someone wants to bring back the memories of a Christmas classic please send me a message on dmd2222@verizon.net.i have searched everywhere and I have not found anything on this and I thought that I can't be the only one on this planet who has this classic on tape there must be other people and if they do they are very few that have this classic so I consider myself lucky and I have all the Christmas muppets except one that john denver did it again with the muppets, I think it's called a smoky mountain vacation, it's not certain but it's close.
