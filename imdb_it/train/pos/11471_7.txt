I'm a big fan of real cinema and I saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say that it was really very interesting. The two main actors are fantastic, the film is never boring, and the basic concept (although obviously inspired by the Columbine murders and the assassins' films) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, like the last 20 minutes that really take away the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense. The shaky camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the cinema it is a fact. But I still think the film is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
