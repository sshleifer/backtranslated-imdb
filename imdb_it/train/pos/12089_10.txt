<br /> <br /> Movie dominated by the raven-haired Barbara Steele, was seen when I was seven or eight years old and created permanent images of pale vampire men and women who pursued a castle in search of blood. Steele is an icon of horror and otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead preceded Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers, unifying them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is intelligent but ambiguous about the forces present. THE DANCE MACABRE is an unpretentious b-movie, it challenges you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such attraction for Claire Bloom, a HAUNTING overla. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this film must NOT be redone. Not only is it a product of the sixties, but the large percentage of idiots with no talent in Hollywood cannot understand the MACABRE terror formula. That formula is based on a priority factor: GOOD WRITING. Low-level classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films featuring R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a strong writing community. Is simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and have them put a plot in today's cinematic chaos. Beyond that, let Hollywood try to change original material and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past.
