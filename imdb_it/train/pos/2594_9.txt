This film took Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman power. "Wilder Napalm" is the genre of themed films that I adore, which addresses the idea that the wonders in America are defined by their gifts or attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film emphasizes that every prodigy is only human and no longer to be feared or adored by any other human being. This was a great comedy, funny and humane with that slight touch of satirism.
