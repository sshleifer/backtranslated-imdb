This film is one that I highly recommend. It's about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) who was unjustly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a youth detention center. There, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet 5 feet in diameter. While there, he meets the other boys in the camp (Zero, Magnet, Ascella, Squid, X-rays and ZigZag). Everyone is digging, not to "build a character", but to find Kate Barlow's treasure. During the film (and the book) Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about how to dig holes. To give this film at 9.5, because, I am very picky when it comes to books by film, (I want the film to follow the book EXACTLY). But anyway, it went really well.
