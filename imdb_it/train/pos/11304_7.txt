I'm not sure under what circumstances the director Visconti has decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not even sure that Viscounti has acquired the rights to the book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the best 1981 version), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for fans of the noir. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensitivity with great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for his sake; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think the film noir works better with a short execution time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep the viewer interested. However, as much as I like this movie and the remakes, I think no one has made the final version of Cain's highly praised book.
