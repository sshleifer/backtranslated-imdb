I saw it on a Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the sub-carts had an excessive effect. This took away from the film, as did the rather limping soundtrack, which really bothered me throughout the film. If the soundtrack had improved, I could overlook the few overcrowded scenes. So the film would be much, much better.
