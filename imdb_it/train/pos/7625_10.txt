Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to appear as Elvis in show business, there were too many false things in this film. First of all, the producers claimed that Elvis opened his famous live shows in '69 after a period of 9 years for the films wearing a white jumping suit made in 1972. They also claimed to have sung "ardent love" who sang for the first time in 1972 and 'the wonder of you' which she recorded for the first time in 1970. They also claim that she got her first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know they did it for her birthday . I know that all films based on the past have something false, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
