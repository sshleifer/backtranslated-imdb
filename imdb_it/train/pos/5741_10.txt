One of my favorite films I saw in Seattle for the first time. Tom Hulce was incredible, without words that could express his feelings / thoughts. I actually sent money to donate to Mike Ferrell to help distribute the film. It's good. The system says I need more lines but I don't want to give away the plot. I was in the Seattle audience with Hulce and the director, a writer I think and Mike Ferrell. Afterwords have been talking for about an hour. Not really a dry eye at home. Because Hollywood continues to be stupid, I don't know. (actually I know, it's our fault, look what we look at) Well, you get what you pay for guys. Take this and see it with someone special. It is a gem.
