In general, it is difficult to evaluate these cut and paste films. Some segments can be quite good while others lower the overall product rating. In this case, for example, the scene of all the girls in the doctor's surgery was quite exciting ... one of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing story. Then there's the segment in Asia ... the lady is always fun. And the story that links the whole was an interesting concept. Not even the swap scene that closes the offer is bad. Technically, production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
