"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These and many other high quality shows show that we are in the middle of a golden age in the history of television. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically valid stories, highlighted by the sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word when describing a TV show), a killer score, great performances and editing. Anyone who is not passionate about this, misses one of the most important creative expressions of television ever. He may have his problems when watching only one episode a week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to see it. I hope they keep it up (as I'm sure they do).
