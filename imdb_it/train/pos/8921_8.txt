I look at this page, and it seems to me disapproving of having to listen to someone who laughs and shouts about a true classic. Of course, I agree to let everyone have their opinion, but this is mine: <br /> <br /> This film should not be missed by any classic horror observer and should be seen by many casual viewers throughout world. Of course, it has lost some of its charm and grandeur with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not why you'd like it. <br /> <br /> You'll like it because it's actually a scary movie, even by today's standards. His general ickyness will insinuate you as much as the original audience, so don't hit a classic if you haven't given it a chance. Look at it, but not with a critical attitude. Watch it for fun, as it was originally intended.
