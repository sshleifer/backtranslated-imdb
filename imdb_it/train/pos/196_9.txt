This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. It's not just beautiful but fun in this movie. (I think Lucille Ball may have modeled her next career in the style of Davies, which could be called "bizarre beauty".) Vidor's direction is light but sure, the story is a chestnut, but the acting is wonderfully contemporary the element of star gazing for fans of the era of silence, with many cameos, adds to the general entertainment. It combines the elements of slapstick with the drama for adults and the good old timeless novel quite well. For all movie buffs who have an instinctive reaction to watch silent movies, sit through it and it could change your attitude. <br /> <br />
