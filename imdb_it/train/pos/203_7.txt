Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys played by Walter Matthau and George Burns is a funny comedy about the strange connection with life and its brevity, but laughter always tastes bitter. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) two great actors of theatrical comedy now reduced to imbecility by the hard and incessant old age you can only feel anger and blue. Willy never gives up and continues to look for work, while Al is tired for the players and retires to his daughter's home country. The couple in his old days was really funny and harmonious, but the scene was a continuous bickering and a quarrel, and for eleven years after the break they didn't talk to each other. Now, if they were to work, they have to get back together again to make one of his best old sketches for a comedy TV show. Is the meeting explosive and liberating for the old questions? The screenplay by Neil Simon gives a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and overwhelming blue the many gags and laughter managed to generate a good mix thanks also to a fantastic couple Walter Matthu (Nomination Academy Award for best actor) and George Burns (won the Oscar for best supporting actor). The two actors are very credible and real and their harmony seems almost like a real job together for all that time and that reality that they can't stand each other. The film is very moving also for its consuming reality as the story is told and as the Love-Heat relationship that links the two actors is totally a real part of the strange but at the same time ordinarily understandable things for life. My rate is 7.
