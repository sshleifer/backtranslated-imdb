When I first saw the title, I was already deducing the theme of the film - clearly it wasn't a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearean and about pounds of meat - taking them or giving them to them. Will Smith is a good-humored actor, so the serial killers were out. It could only concern a man who gives them, so somehow he must be at fault. I ruined it all by myself, observing it and knowing the story before I looked, as the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character's background are dripped to slowly light up the audience about who is and why he does what he's doing . <br /> <br /> Guilt is a very difficult topic to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when hoping for a roller coaster ride - you know it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the film glorifies suicide; digs in the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a sure sign that writing is intelligently thought out in great detail and driving multiple meanings and a profound reflective nature. The most important theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loved emotionally and metaphorically, but that he was physically giving her the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is hindered by falling in love - what a complication of the 2nd act. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very slow, but I am undecided whether it would have been better to insert in a shorter time interval. I didn't feel the tension and its terrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but maybe it's just me that ruined it for me in advance. Actually, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and inspiring tragedy that deserves the recognition it will inevitably get.
