As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the film as it seems a fairly accurate representation of what a trading post must have been like. Also, exposure is required, so we know why Harry wants to return to the jungle. Furthermore, the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying sequences of pursuits ever made. This occurs when Harry's safari group has to challenge a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values ​​add a lot of realism, which actually represents the terrible dangers that await the Europeans who enter the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps earlier, an accurate account of how native Africans were treated horribly by white employers. Plus sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some fantastic sets and two ketas! Don't miss a classic of adventure.
