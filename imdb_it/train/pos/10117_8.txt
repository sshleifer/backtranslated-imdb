The story of a tramp, his head of the sheep ranch and the chief's daughter are not to everyone's taste, but it is still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the scenarios that we have learned to know so well through other films of this region. <br /> <br /> This film was the first time I saw the excellent Mary Regan, and since then I have been a fan of her. The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably remembered by the American public of the movie "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much for the wrong kind of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> He acted abruptly, with unforgettable shocking performances from all his protagonists. I saw this film for the first time in extremely accurate form on late-night television here in America, but believe me, the unexpurgated version is not to be missed.
