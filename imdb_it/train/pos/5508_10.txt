The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, having been a Cuban citizen in the last five years, disappears from the face of the Earth, leaving a lament Fidel Castro to announce that he probably died, when in truth, he left Cuba to move in Bolivia to live an assumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara is committed to overthrowing the corrupt and bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderberg picks up where he starts "Che: Part One" (only better this time). The rhythm is more focused, the acting work is always so beautiful (including a turn by an evil Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it is probably best to see both films to get the true story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I had the rare opportunity to see both films in a single screening ---- talk about a long travel!). As for "Che-Part 1: The Argentine", this film does not have an MPAA rating, but it contains a fairly salty language and violence to easily grab it with an "R".
