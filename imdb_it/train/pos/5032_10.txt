The film "Frailty" is actually more of a psychological thriller than a horror film. It has all the traps of a horror movie, but it's not. "Frailty" is a film about the perception of religion and the realization of the differences between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In "Frailty", a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to do the work of God It turns out that I'm a trio of notorious serial killers called "God's Hands". We watch the father kill the "demons" in some rather brutal ways as he convinces his children and himself that they are doing the work God and that what they are doing is right. He claims to have received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons that live here on earth. God gave him a list of names and in exchange for his "services"; he and his children will be protected, which means the police will never be able to catch them. We see all this in front of us in a very disturbing way. But what really disturbs all this is the effect it has on the two children, particularly the eldest son, Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is until his father and a week in the cellar do not change everything. He knows his father obviously lost his head and is almost certain that the same is happening to his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything as if it were his own religion. He seems trapped in the world of God and his father's demons. I suppose it's because he's so young and easily impressed. But all that happens to these three is quite convincing, actually TOO convincing. <br /> <br /> Events that occur in the film can be seen as a vivid hallucination experienced by the three main characters. I say this because each of them reacts to the situation in different ways and at some point in the film everyone declares to see God. Dad sees the murders first as his mission. His "mission" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession to eradicate demons. In fact, his hallucination is the main one. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are all part of this hallucination. Watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where I come from. Fenton, the younger son, is easily struck by all this talk of demons and destruction. Since he's so young, it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical of his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> In a sense, the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the film. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say that it is not pleasant. After his death, he quickly advances to the present day. (The story is told through flashbacks, seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). In fact, it is Fenton who is telling the story, not Adam as he originally believed. The story is told in the way he perceived it, through his actions and his brother's actions. Fenton has gone mad and is continuing what his father started to attract the FBI agent into his trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is an important theme in this film, the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misunderstood by those who do not have a full understanding. Before Dad discovered his new mission, he himself had no clear understanding of religion, nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. His sons Fenton and Adam often sang innocent hymns from small children, but they probably didn't have a clear understanding of what the texts meant. After the revelation of Dad's new mission, both left in separate directions: Adam remained in doubt that a supreme being existed while Fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A great thriller that will make you crawl out, not watch it alone.
