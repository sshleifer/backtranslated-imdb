We bought the DVD set of "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once upon a time ... life" (in English) for our bilingual children because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German ) / "Once upon a time ... Man" (English) series (we parents saw it as children) and exceeded even the highest expectations! The series is very well done, does not show its age, and our children of various ages really enjoy watching it. At the same time, they learn things that parents didn't know until then, much later. The series covers everything about the human body from organs, all the senses, blood, infections, antibodies and much more in animated episodes of 20-25 min. The arguments that some people may find "sensitive", such as digestion and reproduction, are treated in a refined, discreet and child-friendly way (the reproductive episode begins to concern mainly the child who begins to grow), while it is still ( as typical) informative and fun. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated by the way their bodies work and through the episodes acquire an understanding of it in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes changes between the outside world (a family with 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the episode that covers infections, the boy accidentally cuts himself and the wound is infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this. Similarly, sensory episodes, e.g. listening, seeing, connecting what happens inside the body to the context of the external world and the episode about breathing and the circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the entire life cycle including (briefly) where oxygen comes from ( plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs ever - I'd say it's a must see for every family with children!
