Revised September 12, 2006 Second screening at the Paramount 1 theater during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had World Premiered the day before at the VISA screening room of Elgin Theater. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman who plays a popular actor who is once on the edge of his career and who is taking on roles that may be below him, but who is still with an attitude positive knowing he needs to pay the rent, etc. The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous films on DVD and his being a driver by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman into a local community market where he is going to do research for a supermarket manager role. He soon discovers that the real life market is run by an employee of the "10 objects or less" cash line wanted by Paz Vega. When Freeman's race never returns and Vega needs help in preparing for an interview, circumstances lead them to join forces in a tour through the city to bring Freeman back home and get Vega a job that allows her to undertake an upward career path. <br /> <br /> Although the film was fun, it looked like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There have been two extensive musical sequences (one with Vega and Freeman teaching each other's children's songs in the car, one that literally sounds like a music video by Paul Simon) that seemed to pad to make time appear and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing that Morgan Freeman is as much appreciated as he is because without him this would have been too little. Sure it was fun in some parts and Paz Vega is a delight, but there wasn't enough to say it was a complete movie. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car asking for directions and Paz Vega said he never does. Who ever heard of a guy who wants to ask for directions and the woman who says no! In the real world it is the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits. The motto with a Target Store order that teaches Morgan Freeman how to sell off is simply hilarious! A bit early in which Freeman's driver insists that Freeman's voice on a "Books on Tape" was also quite funny. <br /> <br /> The director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a short Q&A after the selection. Silberling answered a question by saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took over the role, he actually changed very little of what was there. A nice compliment to both Silberling's script and to the way Freeman manages to get into a role and make him feel completely like he was born to play it.
