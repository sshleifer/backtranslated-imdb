I laughed so much during this film that it hurt my face. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a handsome boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance. The whole cast is fun, the story is pretty good and the comedic moments are fantastic. I went to this film I didn't expect much, maybe that's why I was so surprised to get out of the movie completely satisfied and madly exhausted. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or endure relatives. The best part of this film (at least for me) was the subtle moods that caught me off guard and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience stopped. That is to say, the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go see it and have a good laugh!
