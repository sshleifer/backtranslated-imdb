In the sea of ​​shit that Hollywood (and others) keep turning off, this is one of those rough diamonds. A small and simple film that is a lot of fun and leaves you with the feeling that you haven't lost an hour and a half of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I had never been a real fan or I had already noticed it but coming back and seeing this his first performance convinced me to be extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a task for me on a university course I was skeptical and I would have even cared. I thought, "Oh boy, a stupid and chic movie or a feminist indie shit that beats male ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant topics, I will simply say that if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and take a look. Sometimes personal life movies are the best and that's great.
