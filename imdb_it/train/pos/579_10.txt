In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I like most of his work, and this was my favorite. I am sorry that more people have not appreciated it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. He gave it to me to read after watching the movie together. The film and the book struck an emotional point in my heart, and I was whining for several days after seeing the film. Sometimes love is not enough to prevent our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see it in our family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories last for generations. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was struck by its beauty and how well the words of the book's author, Norman Maclean, brought to life, "But when I'm alone in the twilight of the canyon, all of existence seems to vanish into be with my soul and memories, the sounds of the Big Black Foot River and a rhythm of four count and the hope that a fish can rise. In the end, all things come together in one, and a river flows through The river has been cut from the great flood of the world and crosses the rocks from the basement of time.Some of the rocks are timeless raindrops Under the rocks there are words, and some of the words are theirs.I am obsessed with water ". These words, taken from the book and pronounced at the end of the film (by Robert Redford who is narrating as Norman Maclean), are basically scriptures, in my opinion. Any defects in the film could be obscured by the beauty and grace of history and cinematography. It was wonderful!
