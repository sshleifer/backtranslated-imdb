I grew up with this film as my favorite movie of all time. The special effects are incredible for the time and have won awards. I can remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It is simply a great timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, which is the best in the history of cinema. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big bad guy. I have a copy at hand, for the next trip along the memory lane. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants to get out of his bottle of genius!
