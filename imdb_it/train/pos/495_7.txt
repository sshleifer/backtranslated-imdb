<br /> <br /> There is the STAR TREK fee - a lot. From the canon we know the history of the future. Technological advances, events, places, first contact with new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE practically ignore most of the ST fee. An unfortunate fact for longtime fans. As one, I thought the producers would at least have taken a look at the first TOS episodes and back again from there - but no. <br /> <br /> Phase guns, like much of the technology, seem much more modern than the one found in TOS. An old fashioned Starfleet laser gun, a sluggish effect of the speckle gold transistor - that's what I expected to see. Furthermore, I didn't expect to hear pure sound effects based on beeps similar to TNG but far from the TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> At the first vision of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military appearance, a bit of an old Earth navy. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for the degree. There is more military code in the STAR BLAZERS carton than in ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It's okay that Captain Archer isn't sure of the needs of the Universe (unlike Kirk who has never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but within ENTERPRISE they all seem to equal. Not professional, insecure, more distant from the feeling of a formal military service than any ST series - and this says a lot! <br /> <br /> The occasional country-themed music song announces a family's travels rather than the adventures of a major large military ship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE tries to show us a mostly fun, warm and blurry exploration of human relationships rather than taking us on a historic, courageous, gritty and space-rich exploration. <br /> <br /> I would have chosen Adrian Paul to play the role of the Captain and an older human being to be the doctor. However, I liked the actors for the most part. Linda Park, an extraordinary Boston College dancer, will certainly develop. The characters that make up the crew seem to have been created ponderously. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE starts its strongest run compared to the previous three STAR TREK series. We hope for a good future!
