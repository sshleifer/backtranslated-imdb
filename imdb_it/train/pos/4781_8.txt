MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the ultimate David Lynch fan. He is a modern genius, because he is not just a director. His stories and his style have a spell that crosses the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was rather a surprise for me, with its easy to follow plot and absolute sets. However, Lynch is there and, although this is far from his best, it is a film not to be missed. The performance of the late Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
