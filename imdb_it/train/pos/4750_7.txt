On Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was harder, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who would also win a fight. Sometimes we become absurd and we compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems we are discussing people like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a useless comparison since Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you switch from what we saw from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you have to at least say that it would match Chan's. In this film he runs into a martial arts god. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is about a man created together with many other men, to be supreme combat machines. Their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some way. This is the premise for the film, but what it does is set up all the incredibly choreographic fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a marvel. He can do things with and on his body that no human being should be able to do. And that's what makes the show so fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts of the film, Black Mask is strong in humor and this is due to the chemistry that Jet has with its co-star, the official police. They fit together. But to be honest. if someone is reading this review, they want to know if the film is a breeze in the action department. And the answer to this is a resounding yes !!! So much mindless action. You will love this movie.
