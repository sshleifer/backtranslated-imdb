We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story well told in the classic Attenborough fashion: a little too romantic, with archetypes, humor and a stress of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and told to a beautiful peace this is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who became a native Indian, and went to live and trap in Canada. <br /> <br /> The solid performances of all make this film with an easy to see message. <br /> <br /> Two of the protagonists of the film are undoubtedly the nicest we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecoleances. It must have been nice to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute.
