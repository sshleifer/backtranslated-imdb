Although not as wild and original as some of Takashi Miike's later films, this is a great drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a Japanese policeman cop with Chinese parents trying to bring down a rising Chinese mob. To complicate matters, his younger brother acts as the lawyer for the criminal and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than the one with several complications that keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust. It is this complication and loss of sense of about an hour in the film that makes it less than a great movie. (It is really very beautiful). This is certainly worth seeing especially if you don't mind a non-hectic pace. /> <br /> A warning, violence when it happens is explosive and bad. There are also semi-graphical representations of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
