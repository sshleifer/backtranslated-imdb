I really thought this movie was superb. Not only is the story correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrait of Victoria and how she kept her spirit despite being forced into virtual exile while she was young. Blunt paints the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the film are so genuine and tender that at the end of the film you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of his mourning days for Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are noteworthy as well. I enjoyed the beautiful score, which moves in a wonderful way with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered exceptional cinematography, some scenes left me breathless because of the rigor and splendor they depict. <br /> <br /> There have been so few films this year as beautiful and tender as this movie as one of the best of 2009!
