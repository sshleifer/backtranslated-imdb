1.) This movie was awesome! I saw him while I was in the city, near the one he grew up in! I went to see the buildings in which the story is set. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best !! Also, my favorite parts were the science fair, and all the time with her father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father didn't seem to care in one way or another. That line is true. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) The way this film was shot was flawless, everything was so believable that it could have been recorded in the 1950s. The dress was accurate and they too had their own jargon. I highly recommend this movie!
