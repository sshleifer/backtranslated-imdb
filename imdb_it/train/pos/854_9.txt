"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This incredibly fun movie captures you from the opening scene and never fails to offer laughter, surprises and unexpectedly moving moments. I had a lot of fun watching "The Matador" from almost all the 2005 movies. It's a whimsical film with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who has specialized in high-level corporate concerts (assassinating rich guys). He is also experiencing something like a mid-life crisis. After realizing that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican bar one night and meets Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a lucky family man who is about to lose the big deal that could change things for him. He loves his wife a lot, especially since they lost their little son a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The two men are chalks and cheese, almost no common ground other than being in the same desolate night bar. And somehow a conversation is hit that sets in motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they formed reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the straight man and the other is the persistent madman who gets them into trouble. The interaction is superbly synchronized and finely tuned, due in large part to the wonderful performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is Brosnan's movie. It marks one of the most memorable and contemptible characters of the decade. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately and you would probably forgive him. Brosnan could be the last charmer of cinema, but this is his most captivating and complete performance to date. I would not be against seeing an Oscar for this role. <br /> <br /> Consider a scene in which you openly observe a high school girl with impure thoughts and say the line, "Everyone blushes ... No sucky fucky". He does it with the usual James Bond smile and manages to get away with it. He is able to tell a young boy: "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then come back to me" without encountering problems. In fact, it makes us even more like him. <br /> <br /> Yet the film manages to surprise us with some really moving scenes, many of which come towards the end when the film takes unpredictable turns. However, when Julian leafs through his little black book to find someone to call for his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is elegant and energetic. It's constantly fun. And it contains a career-defining role for Brosnan as the solitary assassin in search of normality, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life. This is a neglected gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to watch this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler of IndependentCritics.com
