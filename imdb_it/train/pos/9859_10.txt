The ice age is not just the animation of the year (in my eyes) it is also the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The teaser excited me last year and I spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat is beautiful! And so are the rest of the Sub Zero heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb. Your heart really stands out for the characters in this movie. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the photo. <br /> <br /> I lived their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing has been forced or finished. The emotion was genuine, especially in the second dramatic half. The last film that struck me deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox Production. And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988. Everybody has a real charm and they try to entertain the whole audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
