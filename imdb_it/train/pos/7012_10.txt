Even if it's a rip, it's definitely a "feel good" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as always, does the job and does it well. I could go on, but choose any of the 10 "assessments" and they said it and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I have to include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was mostly unknown to me as a spectator. His performance was very pleasant and I look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come. <br /> <br /> And, this film proves that Will Smith has nothing to prove in terms of skill as an actor.
