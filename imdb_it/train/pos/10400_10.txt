Probably the best fantasy film ever made. Sumptuous colors, spectacular scenery, incredible and spectacular soundtrack Miklos Rosza perfect for every scene and mood. Even acting is superb in what could have been rigid and pretentious in minor hands, but here poetic dialogue is skillfully, sensibly spoken (even humor is subtle and delicious). <br /> <br /> No doubt Spielberg and Lucas were fascinated by this. Together with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two most beautiful films made by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the most beautiful films ever made. <br /> <br /> A true, compelling classic!
