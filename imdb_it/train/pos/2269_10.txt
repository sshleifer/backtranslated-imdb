I recently read the novel "Mother Night", I've owned the DVD for some time and I watch it every now and then. A few films that I own and have seen made me think and question what Mother Night did, I am amazed not only by Vonnegut's brilliance, but also by the translation of her text on the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this film on VHS, it must be done on DVD, and must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. To see how they took a fairly simple but complex story in its substance and in its dialogue, and it worked so well, I think every viewer will be stunned. <br /> <br /> The omissions in the film are few, and it doesn't take much, the film could also be the book, and it's the best adaptation I've ever seen. I highly recommend both the book and the film together which is a bad service to say simply to go and see it. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do.
