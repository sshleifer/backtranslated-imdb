When John Singleton is on, it's * on * !! And this is one of his best films. Not quite as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to it (and with much of the same stellar cast). This film was very well written, very well put together and very well shot. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example: where does Caramell get money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive things? No mention of a rich background ... And why Phibbs doesn't he? have an office? A professor of his stature * should * have one ... And while we're at it, for an engineering student, hick or not, Remy is a pretty stupid character - I'd think he'd have a little more in terms of basic intelligence - speaks and behaves like a real buffoon). <br /> <br /> But apart from that, the film was very clear. A good series of characters and points of view; and Singleton does not take part in the story - many of the characters are not nice, and does a good job of weaving between the Panthers and Supremacist scenes to show the madness on both sides. <br /> <br /> Much of the cinematography was excellent; I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Kirsty Swanson entertains with Taryn and Wayne every scene combined really well. Even the Malik / Deja scenes were really well shot. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was a little more than once; this film had the tendency to get * really * preached at times, and also tends to hammer the points he was teasing when the points would have been just as clear without bluntness (we didn't really need the USA flag with 'UNLEARN' typed on it, give a little credit, we are not deficient ...). And to top it off, even though * most * of Singleton's time uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it becomes * too * too blatant (like Deja's death, which is fine until he yells "WHY !!!" that he simply has ruined the whole effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But acting was generally at the top of the line. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act ??), Michael Rapaport (surprised me to death ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls I thought it was a actor with only one role), and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * exceptional. <br /> <br /> Negative side? Jennifer Connelly was flat; even if it's not completely his fault: his role was stereotyped and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was nothing short of horrible. She whined, whimpered and whimpered. Yet another in the long series of models transformed into actresses who failed miserably (although there are some that demonstrate the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! An incredible soundtrack (which is certainly worth buying!) That fits the film like a glove. Each scene has a twin song (although Tori Amos' songs started to * really * bore me in the end ... not his best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can you go wrong ?? <br /> <br /> All in all: a really good watch, a really strong cast, a fantastic script, a great movie. 8/10.
