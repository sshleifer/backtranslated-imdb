Dragon Hunters must be the most beautiful animated film I've ever seen. It was amazing. The film is about a couple of thieves looking for some money, their strange furry blue dog that fires, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and are sent on a mission to reach the ends of the earth to kill the gobbler of the world, an immensely immense dragon. But honestly, it doesn't even matter what the movie is about. Because it's incredibly beautiful. Gravity in this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of earth fluctuate between cathedrals and castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating water lilies. The world is so creative, so extraordinarily beautiful, with a sort of wind book that looks at it. The world looks like a collection of beautiful paintings. Even the monsters are visually stunning, like a fire dragon composed of a swarm of evil red bats. Part of the plot is not too original, as the main protagonists who want their farm at La Of Mice and Men and never seem to be able to do it in the world; but the beautiful graphics, some seriously sinister scenes and the dialogue that evokes emotions makes this film spectacular.
