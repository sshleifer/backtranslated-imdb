Everything does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This film features a line-up of some of the most creative directors of our time and some very famous names in the cast. The segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. In fact, considering that the approach to the theme by all these different directors takes so many forms, it is incredible that we can even feel that we are still watching the same film. No great effort has been made to transform it into a complete whole. This buffet has so many excellent ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in one dish.
