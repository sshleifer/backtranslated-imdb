This photo was banned by American film companies in 1930 due to the nudity of Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) who caused all kinds of problems among women in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who marries an older man and is taken over the threshold of the wedding night and her husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of tiny things like his shoes and the killer insects. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim in a lake in the woods. His horse runs away and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds his clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very familiar and there is a love story that begins to flourish. There are many other interesting problems that arise when you watch this movie until its end. Enjoy a great classic movie that was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy it.
