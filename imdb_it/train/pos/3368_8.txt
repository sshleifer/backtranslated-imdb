A visit of Hitler to Rome is the background of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stay at home while her whole family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. He must stay at home because the family cannot afford a maid. He would have liked to go there even though she, along with the entire residential complex where she lives, is an ardent admirer of the Duce. <br /> <br /> There is an exception though. On the other side of the courtyard sits Marcello Mastroianni in his chair that contemplates suicide. The reason? He is a homosexual and for this reason he recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and desperately needs a friend. Loren, frustrated by her cheating husband, misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully dramatized scene, directed and performed on the roof of the building complex, offers his body to him only to be rejected. The initial cocca is soon replaced by its hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, this other world that is so willing to give her everything she wants. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully made movie with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren shows here that she is an actress of great caliber when she is well directed. This is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, common people and, above all, the human condition. Despite his sad ending there is a glimmer of hope in the end, things will change, someone has understood.
