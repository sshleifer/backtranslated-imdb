Jörg Buttgereit goes a little too far with his films and themes, sometimes, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically made, often with a deeper meaning to its themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this film. It is not really a film with a story, in the sense of having a beginning, a center and an end. He also has no main character, but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and murders, in 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are told with a lot of class, although some of them are obviously more "interesting" and realistic than the others. They are not necessarily connected, but together they continue to tell a story. The film does not feel at all disjointed. All the different stories have a different feeling and Buttgereit tells the story almost without using words (even typical of his style), but instead lets the images and the obvious sensible sensations of the characters tell the whole story. Help make this movie effective to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, the production values ​​are not all too high and this could be something that could scare some people. However, it helps this film in particular to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire film and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> A Buttgereit film that I enjoyed watching. <br /> 7/10
