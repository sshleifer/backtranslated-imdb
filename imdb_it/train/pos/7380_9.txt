The three main characters are portrayed very well, in particular Anisio by the rock musician turned into an actor for the first time Paulo Miklos. It is extremely convincing as the transgressor / invader of the lower class. The film shows very well the avalanche effect of being involved in increasingly shady deals, the contrast and the similarities between the lower and upper classes. Like everyone they let themselves be carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
