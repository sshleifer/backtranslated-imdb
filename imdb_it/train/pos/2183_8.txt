Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his unsentimental touch is evident in this fairly original story of ghostwriting writing songwriters who both work for the burned music legend Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstandings have been delayed very quickly, thank goodness, and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some beautiful songs (and some more forgettable), Crosby in his most fascinating, a great turning point in Broadway legend Mary Martin Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant who supply most of the cynical barbs (Levant is in a rare form and his lines are by no means dated). A pleasant surprise and recommended to all fans of the genre.
