the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. this film is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. the museum scene is like a nice music video. apres sex scene is a scene all too familiar in all our adult lives. but the film would have had no interest for me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting comes from the study especially of his eyes. he had the most convincing face. his character possesses the qualities I look at in a boy, sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is gorgeous. By the way, I really wish he would shave his beard now that Adam's lips, jaw and apple were his finest set next to his eyes.
