After a short prologue that shows a masked man chasing and then piercing the throat of an elderly gentleman on a deserted urban street of the last century, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out to hunt. They manage to get a loan for a repairman on an elegant street in Sydney, but it turns out that physical ruin is not the only problem with their new home. It could also be infested. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable story, albeit a little obvious, with Catherine Millar's good to average direction in a slightly above-average shocker. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaws seem partly due to the budget, but it's not entirely excusable for that obstacle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening of the "thriller scene" has some shaky changes. Block frames and series of frames are used to hide the fact that there is not much action. The suspense should be created by the staging, not by the imaginative techniques "fix it in the mix". There is a great atmosphere in the scene from the position, the lighting, the fog and so on, but the camera should slowly follow the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we see the road, showing the their growing proximity. Tracking and cuts must be slow. The attack had to be longer, lighter and better blocked. As it stands, the scene has a strong "made for television" feeling, and a low budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film improves considerably. The story has many similarities with The Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget imposes a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett effectively create many subtly creepy scenarios, often of a dramatic nature instead of oriented special effects, like the mysterious man who gets to remove the old iron plates, which had been bizarrely affixed to an inner wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first section of the film may be a bit heavy on the realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is mainly about Julie and Peter trying to organize the financing for the house and then try to settle down. But Morphett writes an excellent and intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough to be as often as suspicious as the more traditional aspects of the thriller that appear later, especially if you've gone through similar problems while trying to buy your house. <br /> <br /> Once you get settled and things start to get weirder, even if the special effects often leave a lot to be desired, the ideas are good. Exhibits help create tension. There is not an abundance of death and destruction in the film - there is more than an abundance of home repair nightmares. But no threat is really the point. <br /> <br /> The point is human relations. There are a number of character strings that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it sour and possibly destroy it. That he is in an elegant neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems not only afflict those who can blame some external trouble, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from a busy corporate employee with "normal" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, planning to achieve something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn how superficial those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through a near-literal nervous breakdown, but eventually finds liberation when she frees herself from her failed romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Although 13 Gantry Row never completely transcends its television hiding, like a TV movie, this is pretty good, with admirable ambitions. Anyone who is fond of haunted movies, psychological films or horror / thriller with a bit more metaphorical depth should find a lot to enjoy. It is certainly not worth spending $ 30 for a DVD (it was the price that my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the movie after showing it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth a rent, and it's definitely worth worth watching for free.
