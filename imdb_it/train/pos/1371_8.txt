This film is a delightful and carefree look on both sides of where the rave scene of the "club kid" merges with the worlds of art, music and performance in New York (with a cameo by the omnipresent Miss Bunny). This is "Torch Song Trilogy" for perky-post-teen girls. "That Girl" for our disappointed and affected millennia. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is fast and fun, and Parker Posey's client deserves - if not an academic award, at least - a wave of compliments for the stadium. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on the very fashionable platform heels of Miss Posey, and is perfectly cast. Like many of his acting works, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey ... but it works EVERYTHING. She is a talented comedian, an incredible entertainer, and this movie is fun, she carries it on her shoulders like a fake leopard wrap, and never lets it fall to the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a fashionist at the superficial party who is not above stealing clothes signed by a friend's wardrobe or going out with someone else's boyfriend. At a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are worry-free in every sense of the word, including other people; and the learning process that care is necessary for life. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully crafted, witty and the only interpretation that disappoints is the aunt, in a role that was too one-dimensional and heavy; a more nuanced performance by her, she would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is comedy. A surprisingly profound role, which gives this film some substance and a vision of the world, is the guy who sells fallafel. We should all be so lucky ... is he the one for Maria? or what goes away? <br /> <br /> I consider this as an 8 because it is not a great moment in the history of cinema, it is not a classic, and it is not a great art (everything becomes deeper and richer in the revisitation). Like "Desperately Seeking Susan" it represents something very true about its time period, but it could become irrelevant with time. However, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and it's worth seeing it several times for clothes alone!
