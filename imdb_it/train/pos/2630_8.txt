"The Lion King" is without a doubt my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought maybe I should give the sequels a chance and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and made people laugh and have fun with Timon and Pumba. Only problem, sometimes I feel that explanations are not necessary because they can create holes in the plot and only the feeling of wanting your explanation. Well, I highly recommend this movie for lion fans or just a night with the family. It's a funny movie with the same laughter and adorable characters as the first one. So hopefully I'll get the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Sit down and think about Hakuna Matata! It means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
