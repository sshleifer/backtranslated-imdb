I saw this film and heard the writer-director, Juan Gerard, speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew was that it was the story of an 8 year old boy film from the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> His opening scene will remember the "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classic films: The Wheel of Roulette (Casablanca), "Spara pollo" (Rebel Without a Cause), references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you'll find more The homeless (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to the Cuban folklore that often uses a black man like a type of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this movie actually is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor his family and his cinematic medium that he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real, as are the events represented. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and a passionate lover of cinema) but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and act in it. Keitel holds the screen with force like the mysterious and reserved grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the first half of the film suffers from strict line deliveries, and some overracting, but stay with it. The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the sweet and sour honesty. It is Juan Gerard's first attempt, but he is honest as he and his passion and his heart really come, in this sincere first attempt. I would definitely see him again and I hope he continues his film career. <br /> <br />
