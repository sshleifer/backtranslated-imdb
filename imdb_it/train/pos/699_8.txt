I saw Insomniac's Nightmare not long ago for the first time and I have to say that I found it really quite good. If you are a Dominic Monaghan fan you will love it. The hole film takes place in his mind, or not? The acting of all the others is a bit hasty and shaky and some scenes could be torn down, but in the end it will work out. The DVD extras are as fantastic as the film, if not more so for Dom fans. It has a lot of sincere moments from the set, outtakes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has experienced an independent film will love watching Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else on the very small personal set and bumping this little thrilling movie out. It was a lot of fun and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
