Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I've seen the whole season online since I just found it and I was terribly disappointed that there won't be a season 2: "(and to complete it, the ABC has now taken it offline, so it can't be seen online because the ABC would have created such a wonderful show, with a fabulous plot and with great characters just to remove it without ever completing the story.It seems to be left to our imagination to understand what happens to all our connected characters But honestly, I think that the ABC could at least put the show online for viewers who enjoyed it while continuing to broadcast television shows of overrated realities: Six Degrees we will miss them.
