In 1948 this was my favorite movie of all time. Betty Grable's costumes were so enchanting that I wanted to grow to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was as irresistible as the Hungarian officer. Silly and frothy as this film might seem at first, when I was eight I seemed to say something important about the relationships between men and women. I saw him again the other day; I was surprised to find that he did it again.
