It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented the teenery. This first film was one of the best. The humorous story presented a lovely 14-year-old Deanna, a small beauty with a splendid voice, like "Miss Fixit" in a family divided by divorce. For the plot summary, look at the other IMDb items, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters intend to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying. With an excellent supporting cast, in particular Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the film manages to captivate one even in subsequent visualizations. Of Deanna's three songs, only "Il Bacio" comes from the classical repertoire, but when she sings in that scene at the police station, the place of the film in history is assured. At least it was for this spectator that at the age of 15 he was struck all his life with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many beautiful touches that take place in THREE INTELLIGENT GIRLS is the brief glimpse of the drunk who stretches his neck for a last look at Deanna while the cops push him! An unfortunate result of the success of this film was the fact that Durbin's subsequent vehicle writers were locked up in the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did it. Her actress stature is more debatable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other characters in the film, it has replaced "naturalness" with the histrionic skill that was lacking. The ploy worked well for 21 feature films.
