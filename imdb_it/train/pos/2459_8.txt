A beautiful and moving film that deserves a wider view than can be achieved. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second-generation Turkish immigrant, who tries to break the mold. Not at all at ease with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience becomes a struggle to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be what wants despite family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming a powerful philosophical discourse, and tapping into Xian Gao's choreographic skills pays off in spectacular combat sequences. In the end, however, it is the extraordinary debut of Semra Turan that gives this cinematic spirit. Raw charisma and martial arts skills are complimented to make his personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> It's worth a try.
