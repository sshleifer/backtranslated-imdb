This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow (although I liked that too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the script is better. Davies is a master at adapting Austen for filming, and here the production values ​​are very good. It's not as polished as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the locations and costumes worked better.
