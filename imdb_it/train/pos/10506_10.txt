Rated E <br /> <br /> I never owned a Nintendo 64, but I played once. In my opinion, with Mario Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I've played this game a lot of times and it's always nice. If you have an N64 and you don't have this game you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side-scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is a bit weird but there is a lot of things you can do in the game. Games like Super Mario and once again you have to save Princess and Bowzer's 120 stars of power. Now you can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
