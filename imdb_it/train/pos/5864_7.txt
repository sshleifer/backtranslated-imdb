I didn't like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite movie in Vietnam is The Deer Hunter. The deer hunter concentrated on part of the war, and then concentrated on the lives before the war. This film is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. History has never been developed to the point that the public can truly understand and experience the characters as the Deerhunter did. Vietnam flashbacks are not as compelling or as involved as those of Deerhunter. This is why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the acting was exceptional. DeNiro and Harris are really fantastic actors. They totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in combat. The character of Harris is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the sense of guilt in Bobby's losing his life trying to save his own. <br /> <br /> I also like the support cast. Everyone in the city is part of the film. The city obviously cannot handle Vietnam veterinarians very well. Like many small cities, it is about being silent, humble and doing business. The character of Harris, however, cannot be one of these things. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some bounce quickly, while others never really recover.
