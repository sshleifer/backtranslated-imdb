Vincent Cassel plays the part of Paul, a former prisoner assigned to an office job in which he meets Carla, a secretary who is rather deaf, when he has his hearing aids in a very dull way ?? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other develop as people. <br /> <br /> What was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters ?? not suitable for obvious stereotypes. Paul appears uncomfortable in the office environment, is he not cut off for work? This belief is dissipated when he gets a job in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain amorality that I find refreshing and shows how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a film full of great moments, both touching and humorous. One is when Carla is babysitting and trying to comfort a screaming child. Do you continue to cuddle him? but brings her hearing aids for her comfort.
