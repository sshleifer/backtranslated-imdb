The film is ok, it has its moments, the music scenes are the best! The soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (appropriate for the beginning as it's a big party and a lot of time), Take Me With U (a funny pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a cheerful ballad , probably the closest thing to R & B on this entire album), Computer Blue (a rather angry hymn to Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs of all time, very vaguely amused with Appolonia), When Doves Cry ( the climax to this masterpiece), I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm A Star and, of course, Purple Rain (a true classic, a very appropriate ending for this classic album) The film and the album are both very good. I highly recommend them!
