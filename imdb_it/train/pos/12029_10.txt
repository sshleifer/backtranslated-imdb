I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite actors and one of the nicest ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of his films, but all those of Jeremy Jordan. The thing I don't like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" kills him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
