I liked this movie. Unlike some of the pumped, steroid junk that is passed off as an action movie, Playing God is simple and realistic, with believable characters, action that is not exaggerated and sufficient twists to maintain interest until the end. <br /> <br /> Well directed, well acted and a good story.
