Disney, the name of the film that once represented everything that was innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally begun to understand that to survive it needs to become more diversified. This diversity has been very evident in the last two years. Movies like "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional routine driven by Disney's song of the past and into a new, unexplored territory. "Atlantis" is still the most daring step, but we must remember: this is still Disney. The first serious film ever released by Disney's animation studio is an important achievement for them - in fact it is so serious that it becomes PG territory. Perhaps because many families have been afraid of seeing him last summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the more mature themes, this is still a film that Disney wanted to attract to families, not only with the public maturity, so the plot had to be simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take her away from the realm of "The Little Mermaid" and others. <br /> <br /> So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, which unfortunately suffers the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, it is an action movie on Atlantis, not on the exposure that precedes it, so we are dragged into the first half hour with how many sequences bombard the screen as is possible without losing consistency. Suspend the disbelief of how the characters pass so quickly from point A to point B, you will hardly find an animated movie that comes out detailed from Hollywood! If you want to have epic levels of detail in the plot, go to James Cameron's "Titanic". Both films feature a boat in some way. <br /> <br /> And we talk about love, right? Yes, as in many films, the protagonist (one Milo Thatch, a proud archaeologist) and a female protagonist (Kida, the usual Princess from Atlantis) will fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as obvious as I expected. At the end of the film, for once, the sequence of characters they touch / hear / kiss was much more subdued. There are various points in the movie where the attraction grows, but it's not just in the playing field, for example, "The Little Mermaid" (A good thing). <br /> <br /> You may have realized that this is quite a cliché movie. Correct. You have your hero and heroine protagonist, supported by over half a dozen crew members participating in the expedition, receiving all their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, occupy the few minutes of recording, then disappear. Doesn't it take a genius to come to terms with? a 96-minute film focused on action and graphics and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to a greater extent. So what is it based on? Clichés and many of them. Each character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. Do you have the stupid scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniac sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale? do i need to go on? <br /> <br /> I don't know why this came to anyone ?? I found the ironic nature of this film quite amusing. Okay, this is meant to be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait in their story? At least the writers have tried to create witty dialogues, and sometimes it is also a little inspired. <br /> <br /> But in the end it's those great visual effects that put the icing on the cake. The CGI animation is really incredible in some places, and it doesn't detract from the characters, which was a flaw that the recent "Titan A.E." down. Speaking of characters, Disney has hired an external artist from the cartoon industry to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. In fact, the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to souls, much more than any previous Disney release. This caused a conflict with the fans of the Japanese anime, "Nadia", due to the overall similarities of the film with the cartoon series. Not having seen this anime, I can't comment. <br /> <br /> With the image, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom directs the sound team and what a soundtrack! From the opening click the sound stage is alive and it's a pleasure. James Newton Howard treats us of a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, without ever seeming out of place and which always helps to build tension or subdue it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the point of this the creators intended. For me, the film conveys that this is a thrilling adventure, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney movie before it. If you don't like the typically ironic attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the graphics will like it. Heck, at least the mythology is much more correct than what can be said about other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is a positive review, 10 out of 10, from someone who has been swept away by this movie. Do I always suspend my disbelief with some animated films ?? after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently interrupted in the middle of cartoons. So sit back, enjoy the trip, and maybe everyone can find something to enjoy this movie.
