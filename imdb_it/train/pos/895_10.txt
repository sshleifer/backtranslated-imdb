I saw this movie. This film is the best according to today's need. The dowry in marriages is the main problem nowadays. In declaring this problem this film is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​are declared very well. Today's youth must understand this problem. There is less population than girls. And because of this dowry problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there is no child, it is not far away. So, keep this statement in mind, today's youth must understand that we cannot take dowry in marriages. We must learn from this film that the gift should not be taken. And if we understand this problem, we can see the new trend in society. This is the main change in society.
