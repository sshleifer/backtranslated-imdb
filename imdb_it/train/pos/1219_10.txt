Care Bears' second film is immensely better than its predecessor. It has a deeper storyline, better character development, and melodies (especially the closing song) are both catchy and friendly. Of course the film tends to stress too much stress but come on, it's a film by Care Bears. This film is a great image to show to children because it emphasizes friendship, love and, again, care. Not to mention the Care Bears are just too adorable!
