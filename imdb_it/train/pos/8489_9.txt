I teach Japanese for an online high school and I include cultural activities so that students can learn about the country and the language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the film. Stereotypes or not, this helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students have told me that they have enjoyed the film so much, they will have a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we appreciate in this culture and what they appreciate in their culture. I just wish I had a clean TV version. I'm not very interested in the vulgar language that self-producers always use.
