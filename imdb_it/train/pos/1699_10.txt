This is a jewel of a film not just for people who love fun and bizarre venues, but who love the history and traditions of science fiction movies and Hollywood classics. Every alien of the Martian crew is the embodiment of a classic science fiction character or a member of Hollywood royalty and it is pure pleasure to see them bounce off each other and the inhabitants of Big Bean.
