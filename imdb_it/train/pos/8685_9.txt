This was the first regular episode of the film Columbo, but was broadcast as the second, after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by the Book". It is also at the same time one of the best! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative director! No wonder they later asked him to direct three more Columbo films. The film has some really creative and innovative shooting sequences and the film as a whole is also clearly made with style, passion and attention to detail. Every shot connects and it's a reason why this movie is better and even more beautiful than any other media made for TV movies. It is certainly one of the best directed Columbo films. <br /> <br /> It is an original Columbo release for a couple of reasons. Murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act. So this time the killer doesn't have time to plan ahead for the "perfect murder" and his to clean up any trace later and have to have the body. The murderer of this film is not just treated as the man who committed the crime, but more like the man who helps Lieutenant Columbo solve the murder. It makes the character more interesting and layered and also helps make the way Columbo solves the whole crime, even if it seems a lot more interesting for that. Of course Columbo starts to suspect him soon enough and as always arrives at the solution making himself vulnerable and with a more stupid aspect than what he really is and gaining the killer's trust. Obviously there is no spoiler as this is how each Columbo movie is set up. I liked the story of the film and how it went on. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film that has such a refined cast. At the time of this film, Peter Falk had indeed created the character of Columbo and the character was already fully developed. Robert Culp is truly exceptional as a short-lived Brimmer. The funny thing is that later he would recite again in three different Columbo films and in an episode of "Mrs. Columbo", only in totally different roles. He also played the killer in a couple of those movies again. By the way, he wasn't the only actor doing it in any of Columbo's later films. Even the great Ray Milland makes his appearance in this film, as the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> All in all, a real great movie of the first Columbo and among the best in the long series of films. <br /> <br /> 9/10
