A fantastic, funny, sweet film with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while looking for a potential independent film. I was a little dubious about the film for the first ten minutes, but as soon as I entered the store I started enjoying the movie. Show how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain complex textures and is easy to follow, but it will lift the saddest moods and make you smile to the full without the need for a little romantic love. It includes several scenes through which you can squeeze your hips with laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
