Personally, I scorned The Jerry Springer Show, however, I found "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. The infinite satire of Jerry Springer "guests" that begins in the opening scene makes you laugh throughout the film. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a weak attempt to justify his existence, I highly recommend this film for pure entertainment value.
