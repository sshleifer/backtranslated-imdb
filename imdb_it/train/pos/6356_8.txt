I thought that How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a pretty good movie. It wasn't horrible, nor was it beautiful, but it was pleasant to look at. I felt like Jim Carrey got a little boring at times. They made the Grinch look like a person with a special education, when all he had to be was evil and devious, but he turned out to be a little retarded. I thought the scenery, when not in the Grinch cave, was beautiful, and there were some parts where I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This film could have been "SO" much better if they had changed Grinch's personality, and they had included other laugh scenes, because most of the humor was not funny. it's nothing to be excited about seeing.
