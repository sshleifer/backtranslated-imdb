<br /> <br /> Artistically drawn, the actors portray exactly their role. You have a real feeling watching Lucienne rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy to triumph again in the tragedy. All in all I saw this movie at least 10 times. And you can say that Prix De Beute '(the beauty award, Miss Europe) is the favorite of MAJOR in my collection of silent films. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this film to ALL those who appreciate artistic beauty combined with a tragic storyline.
