The premise of the story is simple: an old man who lives alone in the woods accidentally stumbles upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder took place. Although a small dialogue is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told by the camera's eye made the film quite engaging. The setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of solitude, which integrates the tranquility of the characters themselves. We can also feel the powerlessness of the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which compares the inability of the silenced child to tell his own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in the feelings of despair, helplessness and irrationality. This film successfully addresses these elements only from images, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak. <br /> <br /> Cleverly, the story takes place at a slow pace to increase the tension for some gruesome and surprising moments. Even the ending is unexpected and credible. Recalling Japanese horror films, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water", or English horror films such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", this film offers viewers the experience of true atmospheric horror. I recommend to everyone who loves the thrill of scaring the film to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you haven't seen the films I just mentioned, you could give it a try as well.
