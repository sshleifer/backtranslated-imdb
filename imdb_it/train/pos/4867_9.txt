Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing a Foggy Day and many other dances, one in a duo with an unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Astaire does essentially "stage" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before learning to exploit the full potential of the film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen ahead of their career as radio-tv comedians husband-wife, doing the kind of dance they must have done in vaudeville and they haven't had the chance to do in their Paramount college movies of the 1930s. (George was a tap instructor). Their two issues with Fred are the highlights of the film, and it's worth the wait. The first trio of soft shoes is a warm-up for the exhilarating carnival number "Chin Up", in which the three sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. The fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find that it is worthwhile to bear the "plot". I saw it 4 or 5 times and found the fast forward button useful.
