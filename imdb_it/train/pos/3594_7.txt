Michelle Rodrigez was created for this film, when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You could say she was a hard woman. With this film, he not only demonstrated his acting, but shows no fear and is as hard as it should be in this film. She is more a bad girl and that's what I like about her. This film is about a tormented girl, who lives a girlish life and is constantly in trouble with school and family. While he is interested in his brothers who train to become a boxer, he decides to go after his love to fight and asks his brothers trainer to train her. Even if they don't think it has the potential, they must be shown wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a bit slow at the end, but it was well done. Show that people can do anything even if they don't think they have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
