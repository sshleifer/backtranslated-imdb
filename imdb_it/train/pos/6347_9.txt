How the Grinch Stole Christmas immediately stole my heart and became my favorite movie since my first vision. Now, eight successive views, it still has the same impact on me the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> The writers Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought history to full life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance while The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some critics of the film claimed that it is not true for the spirit or principles of the original story film. After reading the original story, I must say that I cannot agree. The film makes the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. In fact, it improves the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch has become what it was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you ... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who want NOTHING on a story until you've seen it , you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think everyone can relate to the terrible experiences of The Grinch at school. I think that all of us, at one time or another, were unpopular at school that was always taken into consideration. I know I was ... and that's why I had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he lived. <br /> <br /> And the naive idealism of Cindy Lou Who, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heartbreaking. When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to become her friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that would have made the movie a little better would have been to further dampen the humor and content of the adults. He was already quite sober, but none of this adult humor (like when The Grinch slammed his nose before in Martha May Whovier's neckline) doesn't fit into a story like this. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to be a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place next to the book and the cartoon Chuck Jones as a must for every Christmas season.
