The first thing I thought after seeing "Mystery Men" was how this movie could be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and fun that it's the state of a bomb that defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future it will become a cult, and you can count on their fans. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, and without giving too far, this film is for comics what is "the Princess Bride" did for fairy tales and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" made for cartoons classics. This should give you a more precise idea of ​​the tone of the film, then of the marketing committee to which it was unfortunately signed (this is one of those cases like "Iron Giant" in which the studio had no idea what it had on his hands) . Rent it the next time you want something a little unusual. Never again will you listen to BeeGees in the same light.
