I was hoping the Sentinel would be a good movie and boy was I right. A great story first of all of a novel and I thought it was an original story but I guess it wasn't and it was a very clever story. Michael Douglas is very good in this film and Keither Sutherland is also very good, but it's still very difficult to shake off the role of Jack Bauer in 24 but in the end you do it and he is very different in The Sentinel than he is in 24. also another person who tries to shake off the TV role, but fails. It had Longeria. He was not so good in the film and had a secondary role in the whole affair. After watching the film I had incessant dreams about The Sentinel and I couldn't sleep. Overall Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
