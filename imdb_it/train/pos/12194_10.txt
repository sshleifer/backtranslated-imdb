The surreal noir film is released right after the "real" classics, which define the genre "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Welles' films should not be evaluated against others. He was playing with different rules. In fact, he was playing. This starts where the other femme fatale films move away, so the vague (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with an exhibition of Wellesian scenes (typical rapid-fire style), dialogues (much "hard-boiled" philosophy) and unusual acting (good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional). For Welles "genre" could mean "formula", but he seemed pleased to use "mysteries" as a backdrop for his "amusements".
