"Read My Lips (Sur mes lèvres)" (which probably has a different idiomatic resonance in its French title) is a contemporary and intriguing tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a whim of crime while the unusually matched characters scroll up and down down an ethical approach and sensual slippery slope. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (who I've never seen before despite his long resume in French films) and an even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel (who brought a sexy look and voice and / or threatening in some American films). <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is on its own ground in a competitive real estate office and is the neophyte. The second part is on his turf as a former prisoner and his excruciating adaptation to that environment. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Jacques Audiard very skilfully uses the woman's insulating auditory isolation as an entrée for us in his perceptions, turning the sound up and down for us to listen as she does (so it's still more annoying than usual when members of the public speak), using visuals also as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters act as expected (it is not like that flexible victim of "In the Company of Men", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of the plot of the unpredictable plot (well, until the last shot, but heck the public was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a fast-paced modern office, to a frantic disco to romantic and criminal picketing. <br /> <br /> There is a secondary story that is thematically redundant and useless, but that only gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of the year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on 07.28.2002)
