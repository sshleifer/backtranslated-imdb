In a series full of brilliant episodes, this is one of my favorites. It is not the deepest episode, there is no great meaning or message. But it's very funny, and there are some good performances. <br /> <br /> But what really sets it apart is that it is, to my knowledge, the * only * episode of Twilight Zone with * double * snapper ending. The area is rightly famous for providing a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time, you get a surprise, and you think so, but it turns out that * there is another * surprise waiting. I like it so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is a deeper, more message-oriented one).
