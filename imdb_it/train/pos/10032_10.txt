I have loved this film since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing for everyone. It's a movie to watch with your family by far. <br /> <br /> My vote MPAA: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disasters, nudity / sexuality and some languages.
