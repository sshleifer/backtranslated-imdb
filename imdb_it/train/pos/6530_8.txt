I last read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago, so most of my memory of the fictional character is probably flawed. From what I have gathered, the books have been presented to me at a time when young investigators were popular with children growing up at that time (in my case, the 80s and early 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five and, of course, "Carolyn Keene" is Nancy Drew's most famous. I still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations, usually quite heavy (for a child) to carry around, and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large type. <br /> <br /> Well, the character has been given some updates along the way, as I remember that the later sister Nancy Drew books have become less thick, with a soft cover, with a more updated and more chic illustrated Nancy. on the cover. I can't remember if those stories were the same as the old ones, but I imagine that these books, being ghostwritten, have their fair share of updates for the times. <br /> <br /> In this version of Nancy Drew's Warner Brothers, the character undoubtedly gets his update to adapt to the times, but somehow writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen kept his sensitivity as a small town of 50s, thus retaining a certain charm and taste that erm, people like me, would appreciate. Her sense of fashion, her primacy and her modesty, even some strange traits of behavior that make her, well, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> The family background remains more or less the same, living with single father Father Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who is transferring his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity, and to wean your daughter from an investigation in the city of River Heights. The mother is only a distant memory, and the maid makes a cameo. But what made Nancy Drew work, is the casting of Emma Roberts in the lead role. Grandson of his famous aunt Julia, she too possesses that cheerful gait, those unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile. His Nancy Drew, while at the beginning seems to rub you in the wrong way, will actually grow on you. And in almost what I thought could be a scene discarded by Pretty Woman, the characters entered a classy store with almost opposite reactions. <br /> <br /> While dad Carson Drew strives to bring Nancy out of his environment investigator and to assimilate into the normal teenage life, trust Nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner, a Hollywood type was, was found murdered in suspicious circumstances. Mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself to be an outcast of the local fraternity, and not long after we were dragged away with her on her big screen adventure. <br /> <br /> There's nothing even Black Dahlia about crime and mystery, and instead it's a fairly simple piece to solve for Nancy, amidst friendship with Corky (Josh Flitter), a chubby school friend , and pacifying the jealous boyfriend Ned (Max Thieriot), hiding the truth of his extra activities from his father. The story is intertwined with the amusement of cheese and an old-fashioned sentimentality that enchants and together becomes a little scooby-doo. With minimal violence and no major gunfights or explosions in the bag, this is seriously a genre that is clearly labeled with the "chick flick" warning. <br /> <br /> I believe the film will generate a new generation of fans, rekindle the memories of old ones, and probably probably trigger a new trend in sports moccasins.
