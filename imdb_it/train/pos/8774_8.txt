In the late 1800s in San Francisco, poor and well-dressed Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) works in a bank, and enjoys attending local "fights" (boxing) with fellow colleague and drinker Jack Carson (as Walter Lowrie). One day, the beautiful Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) enters the "Comstock Bank", where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so taken with the elegant beauty of Mrs. Smith, who offers to take her carry-on purse with her. Smith is secretly conquered with the handsome Flynn, but is discouraged by his cockiness. <br /> <br /> The good deed of Flynn (actually, the attempt to recover) makes him get a free membership in the contemptuous "Olympic Club", which conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's presumptuous manner and practical jokes (which tickle men on parallel bars) irritate members of the "Club". When an English boxing champion visits the club, members strive to convince Flynn to fight the man. I am confident that Flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> First time producer Robert Buckner puts together a nice package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner was, of course, basking in the success of his contribution (screenplay) to the studio's brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is definitely ridiculous. There was a "Gentleman Jim" - this story is presumably the film of James J. Corbett's true autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd" - but, this film must be significantly fictionalized. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive starring film; he lightly maneuvered the script, and should have been recognized, in the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's characterizations were (are they?) Neglected as great shows, and this is one of them. Smith does well as his feminine interest, cleverly conveying his emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes stupidity look smooth and extravagant. The supporting cast is a treasure, from the rowdy Alan Hale (like Pat Corbett) to the walk-on Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
