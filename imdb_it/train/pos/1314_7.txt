When a small town is threatened by a murdering child, a lady police officer pursues him pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the killer, her psyche starts beating her up making her lose focus on the task of catching the criminal. Not a high-voltage excitement film, but a solid police job and a good representation of a psychotic loser's broken mind.
