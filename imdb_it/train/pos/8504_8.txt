Play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a tough soldier of the American secret agent who is sent to discover the Nazi secret and change the fortunes of the Second World War. This means that everything to break out of a Nazi dungeon to counter Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most influential game of its time. This is because it has literally inspired the obsession. At the time there were many games and even more they do it today, but sometimes you get a real hoarder. This is one of them. Just like Tetris first and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost all aspects, but the shots heard around the world that led to one of the biggest tsunamis in the game were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. The Space Marines, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and other legions owe their existence to the ID guys. Either directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but still do it. <br /> <br /> Even with its antique look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, the games are now on the verge of level experience)) and highly rectangular levels, the purpose of all and six episodes offers a lot of fun, especially discovering those secrets with a treasure and a chaingun in them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Halt!" * burst! burst! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" it never gets old --- 8/10 <br /> <br /> Voluntarily rated PC-13 for "deep carnage." However, it is exceptionally docile to what the games have today.
