I'm really surprised that this movie didn't get a higher score on IMDB. It's one of those movies that you could easily get from someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" it's really in a class by itself. It's setting and ethnic charm are things that people seem to take for granted. Casting alone makes it an almost perfect movie. Few movies in the 80s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's fun too. **** outside *****
