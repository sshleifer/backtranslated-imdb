*** It might not be considered a spoiler, but I'd rather be cautious than neglect *** I've never seen this movie when I was a kid. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it with my three-year-old daughter. I can watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> For the small acting of Ilene Woods in her life, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very attractive; very credible. The music fits the film perfectly. The acting was great; loved the mice !! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the stepsisters; they were just awful. The cartoonists have described the flawed behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film, especially if you like love stories. My daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and in the end it still gets excited.
