I've seen this documentary twice and, although I'm a big movie buff, most documentaries don't get my attention. However, this film was mesmerizing. Almost every shot is perfect, saying much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have). <br /> <br /> The concept of this film is amazing, I can't praise it enough. Pearls of Mardi Gras - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Incredible and excellent selection of interviews - filmed in a factory in China - the film makes you feel like you're really there. <br /> <br /> I am politically aware - and I read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this film that was a surprise to me. However, it made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I too would like this world to be a better place. <br /> <br /> A million compliments for the director - and thank you for making this film too. <br /> <br /> I wish everyone could see it.
