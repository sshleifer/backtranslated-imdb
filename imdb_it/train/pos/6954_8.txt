This film was one of the funniest films I've seen in years and the laughter of members of the public support me. Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) has spontaneous and intense laughter. It easily became as complicated as Mr. last year Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in his use of parody (spying on Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex on My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Director Ivan Reitman is in perfect balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and downright ridiculous. Never the shock and the drama put the rule of comedy at risk. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance. In a sense, it's so obvious that it's nice to see how it unfolds. Just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that you can't really see it. Eight out of ten stars easily rank up there with Tootsie (1982). Maybe a nine (depending on how it looks in a second view).
