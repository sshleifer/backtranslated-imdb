I remember this show as it became a normal Saturday night show. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a girl who moves with her aunts who, apparently, are witches and she is one. So Sabrina must learn how to control her powers and use them effectively. He must also have to deal with a vicious rival named Libby, his best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle with the school ... <br /> <br /> The show was fun and entertaining. He had fun Saturday nights for a 10-year-old boy ... and he made him laugh out loud ... And flirt with 'Libby' ....
