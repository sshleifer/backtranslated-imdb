I admit I had no idea what to expect before seeing this highly stylized piece. It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all I knew. It started with great images, small fragments to get your attention and let your imagination run wild. Continuing, I quickly learned through the voiceover what was happening. A beautiful story of neo noir that I heard was not a life of a few minutes of my time. The small clues provided to the public through the images at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment in putting together the plot. Along with a nice turn at the end is a fantastic package overall. The score, although not bad, gave the film almost a sensation of music video. It looked a little dated, adding nothing to promote the plot. Some of the performances turned out to be excessively dramatic but perfectly fit the feeling of the overall piece. I walk away from this very satisfied. I was given a lot of information in a short period of time, but through a lot of editing and voice-overs I didn't feel rushed or pushed. Good job!
