Perhaps the best book by Isabel Allende, The House of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean story, this one full of magic, a mystical veil, plus a kind of omnipresent sadness. This film brings together an exceptional cast, as well as great artistic direction, with a script that cannot contain all the qualities of this book. It is unusual for an almost unknown country like Chile to be so well represented by this film, whose only sin is to aim too high, and for this reason the illiterate public has been a bit agitated, especially because it has understood very little.
