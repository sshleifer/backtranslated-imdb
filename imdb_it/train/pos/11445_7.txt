A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Tides, allows fans to see his work on the move. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf and plug he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers and the tides inspire and influence his work. Although I was happy that the film covered most of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I think it was a bit long. The directors did a wonderful job giving life to Goldsworthy's work and they created a beautiful film that was a pleasure to see.
