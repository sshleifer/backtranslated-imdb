I've seen this movie on several occasions. I find that one of the funniest things to do is to watch the reactions of different types of people going to see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many old Japanese men and women go to this film because they think it will be an honest and good samurai film with lots of screenshots and medieval Japanese dialogues. As soon as the two protagonists begin to discuss horror films by inserting curses almost casually in their sentences, the old come out, usually disgusted. <br /> <br /> Type 2: FILM SNOBS. These people think that just because a movie carries the label of "Independent" it will automatically be a load of overworked shit, difficult to follow or that may not be in English. Yet they still see it only to praise it a posteriori, so that people think they are intelligent and cultured. They are really surprised when they see this movie. As soon as the blood starts to exaggerate soaring from anime-inspired sword battles or from the rogue over the top nonchalantly fold a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be so dismayed, they will come out. Some will remain just to see "how bad it will be" and later they will be thrilled with what was a horrible movie for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE EXPECTING TO SEE ANIME LIVE-ACTION OR SPECIAL EFFECTS SIMILAR TO MATRIX. Sorry, martial arts are pretty solid in the film, but director Yamasato doesn't really have the budget for this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS. These are the people who really appreciate the film. If they had only heard of Blood of the Samurai, chosen it at random, or stumbled upon the wrong theater in an alcoholic fog, these are the people who laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it is in the end: ENTERTAINMENT. This film was not created to illuminate or to provoke a profound spiritual thought, it was thought (if I could borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to "really kick a donkey". And that's what he does. <br /> <br /> So, depending on the type of person you are, you may or may not have fun with this movie; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and make sure you bring your friends.
