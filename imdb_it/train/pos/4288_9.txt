Rain or shine outside, enter a movie theater. It makes you happy. (If not, come out.) The lights go out. You'll settle down with an ice cream tablet. Moving images start flickering on the screen. You feel content. In the dark, you came back to the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering the unfamiliar turns and turns of the scenario with the rest of your clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
