Dumbland is not for nothing. In fact, Dumbland may not be for anyone except Lynch and that's what makes it fun and a collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Obscenity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of trash? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful image of some Americans who have no brains and affect their wife and children for fun. From Mexico I can say that I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth are bleeding, all the noise and violence make me want to scream and put my bed behind me. 2- Take the stick! Yes, baby you understand and learn a lesson: some people are never grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. More episodes of Lynch, music, surrealism and a sweet revenge ...
