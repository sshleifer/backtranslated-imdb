Kirk and the crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants, but find the place deserted, with the exception of a certain Atoz who runs a sort of high-tech library. Despite trying to get a direct answer from him on everyone's fate, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insists that they must "make a selection quickly while there is still time". They have no idea what they're talking about, but they wander looking at the hand-mirror-like disks on the spectators and see images of the planet's past. So, while a record is in the viewer, Kirk crosses the door and is transported back in time in a masterly way to what on Earth will resemble the time of Louis XIV (1660). When McCoy and Spock follow, another disc is in the viewer and sent to a glacial hell. Too late they realize that the library is a car and a time travel depot. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit is rather short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more lively, as Spock falls headlong for Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this horrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical boy. <br /> <br /> The abandonment of Spock from the norm, the wildly inventive script and the very different settings make this episode exceptional - really worth to be seen. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the excellent leading actor, played Mr. Atoz. I'm a big fan of older films and I've seen him as a supporter and a bit player in countless movies in the 1930s and 1940s and it looked almost exactly like in this 1969 episode. Interestingly, despite having an appearance ancient, he lived another 23 years - dying at over 95 years !!
