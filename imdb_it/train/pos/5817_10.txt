If you want to remember MJ, this is a good starting point. This film features sweet melodies, MJ as a robot and a crazy and messy storyline. I remember, many nights, moving on to this beautiful film in college, and meditating on the wonders of those who decided to highlight this ridiculous piece of. <br /> <br /> There's a lot to sing about. Lots of dancing. There is a lot of singing while dancing. MJ kills him as you'd expect when it comes to these things. But there's a lot more to this film. There is claymation. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson has to fight in a free dance (obviously also clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - we love you Michael! It's a sad day for us all.
