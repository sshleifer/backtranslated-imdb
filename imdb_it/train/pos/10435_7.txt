My watch arrived a little too late, but I'm glad I watched this and the sequel together ... which makes me congratulate the producers of this film to give such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romance. .. and very marginally separate from the idea of ​​relationships! Since many things have already been written about the film, it would be appropriate to highlight some parts of the film that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think the point where Jesse and Celine make fake phone calls to their respective friends was a very clever way of telling each other in a journey that didn't even extend 24 hours. the curiosity of two people who think that the other had an infallible impact on the other was very elegantly treated ... <br /> <br /> On the plot front, making a romantic story work out of pure conversation it is an easy task to accomplish. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic movies of such flavor, the characters are not clearly designed even in the mind of the writer and director. What the actors highlight is what results from them ... right or wrong, even if the ideas bearers would find it difficult to justify ... becoming the character, the life that the actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors do just the right job! Kudos .. !!! and Before sunset is another feather that makes this even more beautiful!
