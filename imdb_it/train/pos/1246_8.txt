The premise may seem silly, but since the character of Murphy does not take it seriously, it helps to facilitate the public in this mix of mysticism and kidnapping of mushy children. Excellent cast, most notably Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the peak of his 80s peak in comedy / action. There is also some great F / X, a very surreal sequence of dreams and a fairly original plot. Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy movies, but this is worth a look.
