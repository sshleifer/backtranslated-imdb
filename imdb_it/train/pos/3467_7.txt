I still wonder why I saw this movie. Actually, before seeing this movie, I knew practically nothing about the Beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. However, for one reason or another I decided to watch it, I didn't expect much. Surprisingly, I loved it! The dialogue was written and managed very well for a slight accent. This is very important, because John and Paul talk is practically the whole movie, even if they are taken out to explore more possibilities and to continue watching them. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performances in general. <br /> <br /> The ending was also very clever. I liked the way the movie excites you about the SNL performance, and then slaps you in the head and makes you understand that it would be better if they let it go and ended up with a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It's a great way to settle your curiosity about what might have happened if Paul had just showed up at John's door six years after the breakup. This is probably the main reason for my vision of this film, setting my curiosity about who the beatles really were and what might have happened to them after the breakup.
