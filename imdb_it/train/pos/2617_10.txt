I have seen Lion King several times that all my friends have put together. Have a little sister ... you know how it is. By now I have memorized both the plot and the lines. After King Lion 2 came out it seemed ok ok let me see ... the second one was significantly weaker ... then I saw an announcement for Lion King 1 and 1/2 ... I liked it ok we go again After seeing the 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitiveness) have been broken. A really beautiful and original plot keeps you glued to your place all the time. I noticed that the comic was filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao will apply here 100%. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing the cartoon.
