Well, the main reason I tuned myself in to watch this movie is because it was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of the fame of South Park. However, as soon as the film started, the laughter started to erupt from my belly. From subtle gestures to a joke, to the shameless humor of the toilet, together with a constant dependence on some very witty insinuations. This film could ruin the event that is the toughest face of poker, not to mention its poker underwear. Some of the funniest winks and you will miss the jokes never portrayed in Hollywood, along with the constant criticism of themselves thrown into the pact. <br /> <br /> I just go to show that not only is Trey Parker good at writing, he is not too bad for the old acting game. I was surprised by the amount of being absorbed in this film. However, I am quite concerned that it is not available for purchase on the Internet here in the UK. Order guys! <br /> <br /> I am, and I will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly highlighting the funny pieces, and sometimes snorting in my lager. All in all an excellent film if you are a fan of useless comedy. However, if you don't have a sense of humor for silly or rude things, be clear! However, I'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could make you gush out beyond those prejudices.
