Spoilers for all those who are lucky enough to see this movie (so not really spoilers after all). I saw this movie when it was released and can still remember parts of it. It is set in a small town to the west or in that city. It looks more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is particularly evil. He lets his man die at the end of the film and leaves the city, but he has to cross the desert. We never know what will happen to her later, but just before she leaves her dying she shoots her back and deliberately does not hit her and instead water. He is not aware that he will soon be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a fun manor - but that's another story, which I don't remember too well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really bad woman in a movie, pretending to be anything but evil - it can't be compared to the witch of "Snowwhite", which in comparison it's easy to find out. Very narrow Western with few main characters and still absorbent.
