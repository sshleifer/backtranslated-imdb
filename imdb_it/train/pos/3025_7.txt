Bacall is good here - especially considering this is just his second film. This is often obscured because it falls between 2 big hits: "To Have To To Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both paired with Humphrey Bogart. Granted that this is not up to the rest of the films, but I think it's not his fault. I think there was some mistake in having her portray a tall English woman. No accent. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly not a Spaniard. It was difficult to keep straight from which country the people came. <br /> <br /> I really liked black and white photography. The mood is used with great affection - I particularly liked the fog scene. Lighting also does a great job adding intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is simply amazing. Boyer just doesn't fit the romantic lead role for me - so he and Bacall together were a little weird. Not exceptional chemistry - and certainly no magic of Bogie and Bacall. But I still really liked this photo. There is great tension and it moves quite well. I must say that I found the murder of the little girl bold enough for this period movie. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre distinguish themselves as supporting casts. Paxinou as the guardian of the hotel is absolutely evil and evil in his portrait. His scene in which he laughs maniacally while Mr. Muckerji leaves after exposing her as a child murderer is rather disturbing. Even Lorre does quite well in his slimy, snappy portrait of Conteras - a cowardly coward to the end. Even Wanda Bendrix does very well in portraying the baby Else - especially considering that this was her first photo and she was only 16 at the time (even though she looks much younger). It turns out that he later married Auie Murphy who turned out to be a short and stormy marriage.
