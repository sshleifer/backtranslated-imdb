My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in his 22 years of life, he has seen nothing but the walls of our house and his school, which is also occupied by other disabled children. I have been the target of everyone's jokes, because my sister is disabled, and I keep thinking until today that nobody is or cares about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, could communicate and had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't say a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab things. but this film made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to be honest) made me cry. AND I SAW SHAWSHANK !!! This film is seriously underestimated, and it shouldn't. This film tells people something. that people should be proud of their lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this boy was rejected by many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up. <br /> <br /> My point of view: the parents of small children, I suggest your children to watch this movie with you, so they will know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, do not stare at them as if they were aliens. My sister has millions of looks, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
