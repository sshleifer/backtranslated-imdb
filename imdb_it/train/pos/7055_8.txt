Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel, I love Jaq and Gus, so I didn't hesitate. The format of the mice that write a book for Cinderella was inspired. I like writing stories personally and I hope the children are encouraged by this. The three stories are cute and funny, even if the songs were forgettable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked seeing Lucifer, Bruno, the chorus of mice and everything else. Pom Pom turned out to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the housekeeper. A sequel done well for a change. My vote 8/10.
