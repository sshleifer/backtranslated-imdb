"And All Through the House" is a special episode of the crypt not only because it is the first season, but this episode was the first I saw! I remember when I was a young man on vacation with my parents that summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina in HBO, I saw this episode and I was buried in the Crypt at that very moment and forever! I've always been a fan of horror suspense series and I liked monster movies, and with this HBO series I had a scary pleasure again. This episode is the first I've seen it's memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's so enjoyable with a nice twist. "And All Through the House" has a nice cozy atmosphere on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to relax for the holidays! Well, in any case, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who among other things plays in different warner brothers, usually small parts) as a greedy exasperating wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting for money and a new story from love. Just like most horror series, things get worse and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are very high when a maniac dressed as a Santa runs away from a local hazelnut house, taking a late vacation by cutting off Christmas Eve! Like the old E.C. comics lessons, you learn that bad people get what they are for! Well, this story ends with a perfect holiday scream! This story was also in the 1972 film and was about Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time!
