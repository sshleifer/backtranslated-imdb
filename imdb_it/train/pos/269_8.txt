I'm a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the best. The cast's performances were pretty solid and there were twists and turns that I didn't see before each spot. For me it was like Medium meets CSI. <br /> <br /> Has anyone else thought that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they connected in any way? Surely I would watch it aginating or renting it if it were to reach the video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was fantastic. I did not see many things in her and she did her job very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you like yellow television movies, take a look at this if you have the chance.
