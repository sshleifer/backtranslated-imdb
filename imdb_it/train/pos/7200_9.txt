Deathtrap gives you a turn at every turn, every single turn, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many turns that never orient you in the film, and often it doesn't make sense, even if they usually take you by surprise . The story is very good, except that it has so many twists. The script is very good with fantastic dialogues and characters, but it is not possible to capture all the development due to the twists and turns. Caine's performances in particular are incredible. The management is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. Visual effects are right, but most of them are actually in a game and are fake. The turning point is a lot, but it still works and is worth watching.
