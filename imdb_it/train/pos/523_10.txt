Why is this film not among the best 250? This film still appears surprisingly fresh 56 years after its production, but could have been realized only after W.W.II due to the perception of the nearness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected time. And what life after that? In the end I enjoyed the scene with judgment and all the people of all nations came together. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against the American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - here's a reason for which is an American-). It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film which is a true "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans. The way this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than any Hollywood movie can ever do.
