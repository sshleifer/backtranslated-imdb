This film is about a man who has been too busy with the accepted conventions for success, trying to always be on the rise, working hard to be proud of owning his own home. He assumes that this is all there is to live in until he accidentally started dancing, all because he wanted to see up close a beautiful girl who sees every day from the dance studio while driving the subway while returning home. <br /> <br /> At first he became infatuated with her, attending the dance class only to idolize her, but in the end he let himself go and started dancing. In the end it becomes clear to him that there is more to life than working to death. There is also a series of extravagant characters who are learning in the studio, giving the film lots of laughter and a certain sense of bondage between the disconsolate. <br /> <br /> There are also revelations of various characters, including the girl who initially admired, giving them a certain depth showing their ruined past and their struggle to overcome it. <br /> <br /> Even the dance was engaging, with the great competition at the end, but it is not the usual story in which our loser came out on top to win it. Instead, there are falls, revelations and redemption. <br /> <br /> All this makes it a moving and fun movie to watch.
