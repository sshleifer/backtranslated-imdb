They filmed this film on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend appeared in this film. Apparently there is a party scene where everyone drinks beer, (they told me it was colored water, tasted disgusting, and it was very difficult to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us has ever heard that the film was published anywhere in any form. It was never released in theaters (obviously) and, as far as I knew, it was never released on video, and I'm sure it wasn't released on DVD. Yet it seems that it has been seen by some people, although probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love buying it for my brother, but there's no way to find it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how this movie can be purchased? And what format would it be?
