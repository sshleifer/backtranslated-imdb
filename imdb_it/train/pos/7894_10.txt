This is a great show, and it will make you cry, this group of people really loved each other in real life and show it from time to time. Email me and let's chat. I've been to Australia and they really talk like that. <br /> <br /> I want you to like Five Mile Creek and pass on these fantastic stories of right and wrong and friendship to your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I've collected over the last 5 years. See my tribute to Five Mile Creek on www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to extended theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so beautiful!
