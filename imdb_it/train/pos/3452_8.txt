I thought it was a pretty good movie and it should have been released first in theaters. It would not have been a big blockbuster but it would have made good money. The film has suspense and makes you wonder how much of everything is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I didn't expect Justin Timberlake to do a good job. Considering it's his first film, he did a good job. This is a movie that is nice to take and watch when you don't know what you want to rent that night. It should be pretty good. The cast was great. So I highly recommend everyone to see this movie!
