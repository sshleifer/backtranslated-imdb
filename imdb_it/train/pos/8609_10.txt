I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was a great storyline and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways. I have recommended it to all my friends !! I always like a good storyline and this movie has had one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that Natalie did to find out more about her life and her loves. He showed how we not only have lives with our families; but we also have parts of our lives that we don't share with them - because it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we're so proud of. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another film of this kind, and will keep an eye on it.
