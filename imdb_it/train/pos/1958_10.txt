I heard that Madonna was briefly considered for the role of Catherine Tremell. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. It's not even close. <br /> <br /> EVAR INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a little long in the tooth, despite the improvement effects of modern chemistry and surgery. However, he cunningly treats us of a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the mandatory sex scene, she projects pure crystalline lust. Especially his hooded, bright eyes and a flat, pleasurable face. Thanks to the brilliant use of lighting and other scenic techniques, the harsh lines of age only occur occasionally. Rather, it appears to have a slight golden glow (YES, BLOOD). <br /> <br /> The locations gave us a vision of London which is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes. The character of Catherine is so powerful and threatening that I thank my lucky stars that our paths have never crossed. I wouldn't have had a chance. <br /> <br /> THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; ATTEMPTS TO COMPLAINT: I ​​must briefly comment on the original 1992 film, set in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It's great, from music to set settings and so on. Paul Verhoven has gotten extraordinary performances from the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of Bay Area Gay and Lesbian activist groups. The attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. SWELL. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-scripts that would promote their political and psychiatric programs. Example: Resolutely supporting sexism and misogyny, they asked that the leading role be changed from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. <br /> <br /> On places in San Francisco, kind and tolerant activists did their best to sabotage the shooting of scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. The executive producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, have promised to fight any attempt to limit the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restrictive orders against disruptive tactics. <br /> <br /> BLOWBACK: Thanks to the fulminant activists, the film received enormous coverage from the national press: millions of dollars of free advertising. Their requests to viewers to boycott the film provoked a reaction that forced customers to wait in long lines wherever the film was launched. He also received wide critical acclaim. It was, in the words of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK, "A GREAT STROKE!" I'm sorry, kind reader; I couldn't resist that. Yes, it's a real misfortune. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art <br /> <br /> that deserve protection according to our Constitution.
