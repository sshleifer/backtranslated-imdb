Rosenstrasse is more of an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept many movie-goers away in search of a Pianist-like plot. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist peep in an age too illustrated on his colorful appearance, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the standpoint of the common Aryan German rather than from a Jewish point of view . Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung loads of people trapped in historical circumstances of which victims emerge. The film's rhythm is introspective, acutely slow, meditative. Furthermore, the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passage of time have been cleverly created. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are quite distinct. Another flaw lies in a trivial cinematography incapable of capturing the intensity of the internal drama experienced by the characters. However, this film deserves to be seen. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmare past, a trend that includes excellent films like Nowhere in Africa and, recently, the controversial Downfall. I would recommend this film to those who can read beyond images.
