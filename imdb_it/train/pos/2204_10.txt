I think the film was a bit weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. It is not mentioned again. The special effects could even be better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. Not the best example of a classic horror film, but it was still a good movie. I give him about a 5 out of 10 of the scale.
