The title is the sound that one of the characters makes while driving his imaginary cart through the dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of Shugoro Yamamoto stories and tells the story of a group of people who actually live in dilapidated houses on the edge of the dump. It's a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color film made by Akria Kurasowa was something I wanted to see for a long time. Strangely it has often been listed as available only in a shortened version by a three or four hour original due to an error in execution time in some promotional materials. I was waiting for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted to see, only to find out about the recent release of Criterion that the 140-minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Finally sitting down to watch the film last night are mixed emotions about the film. First of all it is visually connected to every movie that followed. You can see all the other Kurasowals films that remain six, reflected in this film, up to the painted sunsets. It is a surprising film in its use of color and you can understand why it took so long for a film that would have pleased him (of course there are also failed projects). The film is a visual work of art. (Even if you are alerted if you see it on your widescreen TV, it was shot at 1.33, so it will appear in the normal TV report). The rest of the film is a mixture. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not come together. As separate stories, they all work well but, like a whole movie, they are not a whole. I don't blame Kurasowa since you can't always hit things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman who specializes in multi-character movies of this genre occasionally bombarded himself. <br /> <br /> This isn I can say that there are no reasons to see the movie. Like all Kurasowa movies, there are always reasons to see his films, whether they work or not. The first trolley trip is one of the best things Kurasowa has ever done and is worth the price of a rental. It is one of the most magical moments in the history of cinema when the trolley is inspected and taken out. The father and son who live in the car are moving (although ultimately very sad) and there are other pieces that shine (like the cast that is out of the ordinary) and you should at least try the film as something other than a man we usually associated with samurai movies or detective films. <br /> <br /> It is an intrigued bonfire of a master director which means in this case it is better than most other filmmaker successes. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 overall, much higher in pieces.
