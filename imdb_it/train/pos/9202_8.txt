Admittedly, Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a pause to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also a former winner of the beauty contest title, assigning her to a role, which was tailor-made for her debut. Her bespectacled glasses and her swaying to the mesmerizing music made her a moment dear to the spectators. This film is a feast for the eyes, with its scenic venues, ethnic people, those Buddha temples and the chirpy, the evil Mumtaz, who looks very attractive, in his ethnic attire and dancing skills. Dev is obviously adorable and this is one of his commercial performances. Hare Rama manages to keep the interest alive, with captivating script, editing and music. Like Des Pardes, his other film, Anand addressed the issue of young people falling into the habit of drug addiction, and their theory from disturbed families and troubled childhood is quite plausible. A good entertainer, this film retains its freshness until the date!
