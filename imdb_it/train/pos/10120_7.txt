The film begins as a less hyperkinetic Dead or Alive, more pastiche: strange underground activities are performed while the bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is killed, a Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he finds out that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get damn fast. <br /> <br /> A previous work by Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society is still full of its usual in the old ultraviolence and sadistic sexual acts, even if it is not one of its most eclectic or flamboyant pieces. Rather, it is a bit well made of pulp fiction, while Tatsuhito makes his way underground, a maze that leads him to a leader of the gay Triad who sells illegally earned body organs from Taiwan and holds a quasi-brothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the policeman at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother is involved in this society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and uses equally violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate this sordid realm. <br /> <br /> What's particularly interesting about this little work is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, then returned to Japan and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so he killed his father and developed a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearean character, which is quite strange as it is, much less that he actually begins to feel sorry for him when his last showdown with Tatsuhito will come. And Tatsuhito himself is an equally tragic figure when he is forced to struggle with his inability to control his brother. While it would be rude to say that Miike's films are successful above all in their shock value, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter and exciting characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
