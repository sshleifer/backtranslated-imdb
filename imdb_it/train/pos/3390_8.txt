Time is the future and for many it is not aware of it, that day is now. In this final film for the legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a reference classic. Many movie fans and environmentalists believe this is our final story. The film is based on the novel entitled "Make room, make room" but the job title has been changed to "Solent Green". The story concerns the Earth as it evolves into the future with the environmental problems of the world that become nothing short of catastrophic. The planet's natural resources have been depleted and basic food has been reduced to basic commodities. They are available in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now 'Solent Green.' However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient in Solent Green and shudder at their own guilt and fear divine punishment. The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). Upon his death, a police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Even if corruption reaches the top, it begins with Simonsons Bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and security chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson) who turns to Thorn for a Waste Desposal Factory. Thorn's boss, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes his suspicions but warns him of those "taller and warmer" who want to close the case, but Thorn will not risk his "job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers marks him for death, but how the film awaits a final warning. ****
