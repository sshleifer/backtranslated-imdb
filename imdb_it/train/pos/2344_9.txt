I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings on a private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the on-air commercials that showed the premise of the show. At first I was skeptical, especially after the Six Feet Under finale was still in my head. Here we are again, I thought. I saw the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it was the subject of death and presented in a way that was pleasant without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned, the main character who cannot literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of his death. <br /> <br /> Most characters have nostalgia for things they can't have. In addition to Ned and Chuck, Olive aspires to Ned. Lily and Vivian wish granddaughter Chuck and Emerson always want the monetary rewards arising from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and credible. I like the way Emerson, who is black, plays the rest of the characters since he is African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. <br /> <br /> All in all, this visual fairy tale is one of the most precious entertainment pieces I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough for those who did it for fans of the mystery. I just hope the writers get back to work, so the show can continue to evolve.
