This film stars Emily Watson, of the fame of Breaking the Waves. This film about a man's obsession takes place in a resort where a chess tournament takes place. A chess master arrives and shortly after he falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by Emily Watson. He falls in love with this strange figure of a man obsessed with chess. This is all to the dismay of his mother, who is much more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a true gentleman. His mother feels that this is only a passing fantasy for the young woman, since she has a tendency to take strange and similar animals. What follows is above all a journey into the psyche of man. It tells the story of how his past is closely related to his present. Emily Watson is fantastic in this, as is the actor who plays the main character. It's definitely slow, but it's worth watching. The ending was even satisfying. :)
