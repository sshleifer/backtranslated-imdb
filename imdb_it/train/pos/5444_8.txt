Class Reunion is a gem of highly underrated comedy. It is 1982 and the 1972 Lizzie Borden High class is back for a 10-year reunion, including the usual stereotypes, moleskin, fat man and nerd etc., but ex students are on a bumpy night, one of the their classmates is Walter Baloer, the class wimp who was the subject of a comedy joke by the rest of the class during graduation evening and has since been in a mental home, Walter runs away and now plans to avenge his humiliation ,,,,> <br /> Despite the dark premise, this is just an excuse for a lot of gags and very funny series. To say a lot more would ruin the movie, but if you like Naked Gun & Airplane movies you'll like this, and what other movie does a musical cameo by Chuck Berry offer? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
