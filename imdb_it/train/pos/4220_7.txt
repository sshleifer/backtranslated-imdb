This is where the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays a type of Agatha-Christie murder mystery writer who blocks his nephew for marriage in a safe. Gordon believes he killed his niece and the young man dies from suffocation, while Gordon travels to and from New York. However, he manages to leave behind clues, scratches on a couple of black safes and an impromptu and well hidden note. Columbo enters the case, immediately suspects it and solves the mystery simply by using his supernatural mystic intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is available as Gordon's secretary and aspiring blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the niece of the psychologist B.F. Skinner. I'm not sure his ancestors have anything to do with his attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but I have always admired Skinner in any case. <br /> <br /> The murder is well managed. It's a good storyline, and none of the artists or troupe vent anything. But the exceptional figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a skosh over five feet tall. He was over 80 and looked at her. There are moments when she almost staggers, but constantly exudes charm. His acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when it's serious or when it stages Columbo and the public. He also gave good lines. What humor comes to us from Gordon. Columbo has none of his frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good job by all concerned.
