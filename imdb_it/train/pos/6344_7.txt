I'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep getting this movie stuck in my head. The Grinch appreciate Martha May, Cindy Lou (which is very boring, her sweet innocence) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, the Grinch's childhood (very funny!), And besides the weak final obvious Christmas it's all about gifts. I must say that I felt stupid going out of the theater with a group of children and children laughing and so on, but this film was a good adaptation of the short film by Dr. Seuss and IS for all ages.
