I saw this film as an employee of Jane Austen and I always feel doubtful about the cinematic rendering of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, attentive, delicate, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect ! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most delicious and amusing novels, thanks to situations and characters that pervade irony. The film respected this subtle irony, not neglecting the comic element (especially Miss Bates). What involved me in the novel, and the film makes it clearly, is the profound knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist, and the modern gaze with which women, men and their relationships are managed, and it is surprising if we think as a writer of eighteenth-century novels, who lived an almost secluded life, she could capture so much depth and truth about life as she did: that most and still fascinates me. We can perceive this modernity throughout the film: it is enough to replace the costumes and use a more current language, but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in the life of other people or the insinuating envy that now always regulates women's relationships, and again the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one's feelings, especially love: every situation becomes universal and out of the common time value. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays he would probably be too mature for this), Toni Colette is simply fantastic. And how I envied them for the wonderful clothes they could wear! And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation takes on a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a really pleasant and worthy film.
