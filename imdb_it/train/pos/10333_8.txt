This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both extremely creative AND openly discusses Nazi atrocities before the full extent of the death camps is revealed. While the end of 1944 and 1945 revealed how wicked and horrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the era I saw on Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a courtroom in the future - after the end of the war (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and the witnesses who reveal Grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks are called one by one. In the beginning, it seems that the film will be understanding or will explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a while, it becomes very clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are incredibly well made and certainly keep your interest and make the film less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film does a great job considering the film mainly stars second-rate actors. There are many compelling scenes and shows - especially the highly anticipated Jewish extermination scene towards the end that cannot help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way that you might not notice in the beginning. Overall, it's a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This is not intended as a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler has been called "that paper hanger". This is a reference to the myth that Hitler once made money by putting up wallpaper. This is actually not true - he had previously been a "starving artist", homeless and served in the German army during the First World War. A horrible person, yes, but never a crutch!
