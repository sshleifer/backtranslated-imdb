I saw the film at the Viennale some years ago, where the audience liked it. I liked it a lot, the performance of Summer Phoenix still haunts me, that's why I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in London around 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. He desperately tries to become one, but it is not before a man treats her badly that he realizes on stage, that he is talented and that he connects with the public and emerges as a stronger human being. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews, her performance was destroyed, they accused her of being boring, not able to give life to her character. I think it's her strength, it's exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make Esther a rather boring girl. So his transformation in the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great, the images of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was then. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my opinion is the length of the film, you lose contact with the characters, after all it's just about finding the actor in himself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film . It is Phoenix's credit that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
