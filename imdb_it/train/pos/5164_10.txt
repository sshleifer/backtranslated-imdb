I attended the Chesapeake camp. He was at the head of the Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar summer camp with cabins. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and later became Junior, Senior counselor and, later, the director of the Waterfront. If the camp had continued, I would have done everything in my power to become the camp director. Unfortunately the powers of the YMCA have decided to close the field and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the previous camp a few years later by boat and was dismayed by the negligence of the MD state and the natural destruction of Mother Nature. The 350-acre site has served so many with all the advantages of contact with nature offers. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and custodians of the property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I idolized his every being. Even if he didn't know how to swim, he was an angel. If I asked him where he caught the fish, he would have designated the place, and I would have had a ball. At the end of the summer there was also a family camp. These memories will be with me for eternity.
