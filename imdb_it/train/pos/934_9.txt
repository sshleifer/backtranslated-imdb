In our family, we are big fans of A Christmas Carol and we watch virtually every version every Christmas, including the old Reginald Owen from 1938 and the modern Patrick Stewart from 1999. Our absolute favorite is the classic black and white of 1951, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and his conversion sound the most true. However, this 1984 version has its own unique merits and makes a story beautiful and fun, quite generally faithful to the Dickens novel. (See my comments on other film adaptations, if interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott can certainly look pretty crappy and not make a bad Scrooge. I love his sideburns, his long coat and hat. Cut the most beautiful fashion figure of the lot, and a handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems that Scott is enjoying his role as Scrooge just a little bit and doesn't take it as seriously as it should! <br /> <br /> This interpretation has the best general Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know that this story will have a happy ending. Shot in the city of Shrewsbury, England, it seems somewhat British. The film has a beautiful soundtrack, with wonderful and lively music in all the appropriate parts of the story. Sometimes I could almost smell the roasted chestnuts and the pudding that sang in copper! <br /> <br /> Marley's anguished ghost (with his wonderful open-mouthed scene) and the three Spirits are all quite convincing. The past Christmas is a beautiful ethereal woman, a wonderfully gigantic and jovial Christmas present, Christmas still to be wrapped and foreboding as always. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a little quiet and somber, not as cheerful and friendly as he should be. I like his nephew's wife, who they called Janet, with her lovely vintage hairstyle. Instead of a blind man's bluff, they invented a game called Similes for his nephew's Christmas dinner, which is a cute little touch, Scrooge getting into the spirit of the thing. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their slightly skinny (though much appreciated), the Christmas dinner is well represented, with Bob (David Warner) adequately understanding and long-suffering in his miles of scarf. Ms. Cratchit is performed in a charming way by Susannah York, who also starred with George C. Scott in Jane Eyre's wonderful 1970 adaptation. Above all, this version unquestionably has the best Tiny Tim, not just an adorable and adorable little but sickly. With those dark circles under his eyes, it seems unlikely that wil's fragile thing survives the hour! <br /> <br /> This is a delightful and moving version of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere, it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
