"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A tragicomedy with very profound implications on the destiny of humanity shown through the eyes of apparently very simple and common people from a Serbian province abandoned by God just before the beginning of World War II. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution, and since then I have had no chance of seeing it. It is a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. I searched for his VHS or DVD copy many times and, alas, I didn't find any. I would be very grateful to the other fans of this little gem of the cinema for a suggestion on ways to buy a copy.
