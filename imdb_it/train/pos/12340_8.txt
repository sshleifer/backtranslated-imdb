There's really a lot to complain about this cinematic version of Molnar's mystical game - Farrell looks good in his main role, but his jokes, frankly, stink. This too suffers, in large part, from this credited as the first film that makes use of rear projection. The sets look fake. <br /> <br /> There are two great strengths in this show, however: although the readings of the dialogue flutter, the visual performance is perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is little remembered today: mainly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell shoots down the EAST OF BORNEO programmer in simple shots of her: she credits the elegant visual direction of Melford's original. Its great beauty and its simple (though easy-going) performance help to repair some of the damage to the earth-bound sections of this film. <br /> <br /> However, one of the themes of Borzage is the mystical power of love, and it is the management of the celestial sections that make this great, from the arrival of the heavenly train to the journey to "the Hot Place" . H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. <br /> <br /> So we have an imperfect but very interesting version here. I think Lang's 1934 version is better, as are the heavenly scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down music remake. But I still really enjoyed this version and I think you should give it a chance.
