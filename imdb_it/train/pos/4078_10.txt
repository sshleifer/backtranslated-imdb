This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many beautiful cinematic qualities like this. This film has it all: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent "spout" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to "figure it out" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a thoughtful break). This is just a fun and enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The only discordant note is the American dubbing. I found Vander-Geek just annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the set of two discs and it sounds! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second level level, look at the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret.
