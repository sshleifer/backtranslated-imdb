I will not repeat all that has already been said by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this is an excellent film, not only as a very human story of the developing relationship between a father and his adult son, but also as a small window on the world of the practice of Islam, for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that of the young person's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards religion seems to change subtly as we progress in their travel with them. <br /> <br /> This is very inspiring, fun and well made film that I would recommend to anyone with a brain and heart.
