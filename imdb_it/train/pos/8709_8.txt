Recently (May 2008) I discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although since then I have seen a great deal of high quality films (in the late 1970s (I was 10 in 1978)), this low-cost three-episode thing continues to be strong. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Now I watched it with my 10 year old daughter, and she experiences just the same thing I remember from then: The disturbing music (she had to hold my hand, even if it was raised looking at LOTR and Resident Evil), the ever changing theories about who is actually the culprit, and also complaining about theatrical voices from an era before Norway, discovered the difference between theatrical acting and film acting. <br /> <br /> This is the one and only good science fiction film (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's still worth looking at.
