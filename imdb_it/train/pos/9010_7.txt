A bit bizarre and bordering on bad taste; but smart enough to be worthy of watching. A young woman in a wheelchair, Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), is joined by a reluctant caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who daydreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his troubled life by taking care of the independent and dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease that has left almost all his motor skills and speechless. Carried and full of spirit, his last dying desire is to lose his virginity. He offers himself to Richard, who will not help her directly; but he is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this film ambitious and fun. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
