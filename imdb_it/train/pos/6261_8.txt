Fantastic documentary from 1924. This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful. Look at this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille didn't take notes before doing his ten commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that was probably born during the shooting of the extraordinary landscapes of this film. Fans of Werner Herzog will find this film a treasure, with heart-rending stories of struggle, complimented by the land around them, never was the human capacity to endure so obvious. The fact that this was achieved when not only the will of the subjects but also the directors themselves was shown.
