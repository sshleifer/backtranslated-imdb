I found this dark comedy deeply entertaining. Brosnan is brilliant; as anyone now testifies, it should not be classified in the role of the bond. Kinnear was as charismatic and fun as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I laughed so much during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be "I feel like a prostitute in Bangkok one Sunday after the navy left town". Brosnan delivered this very un honest line with such unexpected subtlety. I was very impressed with Hope Davis' performance. It seems that everyone in this film has branched out from their previous work to the point of actually improving the play. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will surely like it. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
