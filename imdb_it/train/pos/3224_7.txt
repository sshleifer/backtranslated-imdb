I saw this movie expecting what I got: good things from science fiction cowboys. What really surprised me is that Kurt Russell did a great job with an extremely limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to act under these two restrictions: you have very few dialogues and because you're doing the tough, military robot, you're not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? A bit like asking a diva to perform in a big air while gagged and tied by adhesive tape. Despite being verbally and externally handcuffed, Russell brings out an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human, despite the constraints. Good job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs ensures that he will go down in history as a great portrait painter of the consummate villain, the one you would like to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, sweet, motherly and beautiful. I'm not sure how much my impression is based on his acting and how much on his physical beauty, but it was hard to take his eyes off her. Unfortunately, the role of Gary Busey was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is fairly standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but since it has a sci-fi comics feel, I don't see what's wrong with some weaknesses. At the end of the story the good guy wins, and the grateful audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yup! <br /> <br /> The kind of weakness that Russell thinks he hasn't done a good job of acting is the same kind of problem that missed the point.
