I've been looking for this film for years, apparently it's not available here in the US, so it bought me a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods in search of a bear that apparently killed several campers. What they find is a crazed ex-Vietnam veterinarian (he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal nails at Freddy Krueger). As soon as night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief discussion with her boyfriend, she is killed. After one of the group has found his body, they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight. Once the sun rises, everyone tries to get him out, but victims fall one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not a lot of blood, but a couple of good murders, especially the dead girls. The boys are killed in a somewhat bloodless way (blown up in the car, shot to death, knife through the head). <br /> <br /> Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a nice slasher film from the late 1980s. Nothing new, just well acted, fast pace and some beautiful women. 10 out of 10.
