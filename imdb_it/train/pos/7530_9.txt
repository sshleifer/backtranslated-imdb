This is, so to speak, a sequel to the animated Batman and is pretty much as pretty and for all the same reasons it has a lot of action in it the plot is good the voice over the actors are really good as Kevin Conroy as batman Mark Hamil as Joker, etc. The bad guys are really as good as The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman because it's really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collectors' edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********* su ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** out *****
