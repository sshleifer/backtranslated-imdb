I had fun with Longstreet, who followed in the footsteps of Raymond Burr's hit TV series Ironside and intended to compete with her. But this show was canceled after a season because it was decided - I mistakenly believe - that Longstreet was unable to compete with Mr. Burr's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this show was particularly well done and very memorable. I hope a Longstreet box appears. <br /> <br /> Writers should note that this idea of ​​history was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the game and the interaction of disabilities on TV.
