This show was great, it wasn't just for children, as I thought at the beginning, it's for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season concerned mainly the father who takes care of the two daughters and the son, who sadly passed away in the second season, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I am dressed in the show as what would have really happened in real life and I need to mention The Goodbye Episode was so well done, it must have been so difficult for them to film this, you could tell they were true tears in their eyes. I am 24 years old and this episode made me cry because I know how they felt when my father died when I was 13, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> The second season and the third season had a great comedy there too, the third season had some of my favorites like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think the show was strong enough to go on, I was disappointed that it was over, it was one of the best no it was the best family comedy since Home Improvement and it could have been be the next Friends. <br /> <br /> should never be over, but still loves to watch repetitions every day.
