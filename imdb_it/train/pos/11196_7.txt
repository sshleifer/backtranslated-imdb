'One-Round' Jack Sander is so named because he is a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. If they can last a round, they win a prize - a popular way to attract customers in touring shows long ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, although her head turns quickly when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What no one in the fight knows is that Bob is the champion, so he can beat Jack - even if it takes him some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and to give up the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he will rise up the rankings until he is almost ready to face Champ. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel start running behind Jack's back - even though Mabel is now married to Jack. So when the final fight takes place between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will the justifiable anger towards Bob increase or hinder his performance? Tune in and see. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this type of film seems strange to a director known for mysterious suspense films, in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre he directed or written (did both for this film). In fact, in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, since a somewhat similar plot arrived in one of his later silences, THE MANXMAN (also played by Carl Brisson as the offended husband). So, although this seems very similar to a boxing movie of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director - even with his rather formidable ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, although somewhat predictable and having Ian Hunter in a boxing champion seems silly, the film works well. Although far from perfect silence, it is worth seeing and contains a nice punch.
