This is one of the best animated family movies of all time. Moreover, practically all the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind as Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service". Spirited Away is pretty good, but a little too scary for the typical family fare - better for teens and adults. The only thing that distinguishes "Laputa: Castle in the Sky", apart from the other films by Miyazaki, is that it is much more than an adventure full of tension. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so beautiful? Because it is a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is really compelling and compelling. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese souls are imaginative, but decidedly obscure or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized and youthful. None of these problems affects Castle in the Sky. He has imagination to burn, and the characters are well designed, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those trench coats that posers wear) There is a lot of adventure, but not blood and blood. Animation is composed of smooth, detailed and cinematic allies - not many flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The dubbing in the dubbed English version is first-rate, in particular the two protagonists, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also fantastic. Use the studio sound if you have it. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I particularly appreciated is that a large part of the background remained unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned. Why? We will never know. We know how much we need to know, so we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most minor characters, who are mostly one-dimensional characters in a series (eg, grumpy general, silly helper, old kooky miner, etc.) Highly recommended for people from 6 to 60 years!
