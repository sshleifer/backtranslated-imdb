This is probably Karisma at its best, apart from Zubeidaa. Even Nana Patekar gives her best, without even trying. The story is very good sometimes but in the end it seems to drag on, especially when Shahrukh enters the picture. What really pleased me was the lead performances, the delivery of the dialogues, as well as the story, for what it was. It may have been directed better and modified. The support case was also great, including Karima's mother-in-law, although she only had a brilliant moment, it was good to see her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also quite good. I didn't really like their interpretation of a Canadian family, but once they enter India, it's as real as it becomes. <br /> <br /> In general, I would like to make a nice accomplice!
