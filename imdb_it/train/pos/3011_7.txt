One of Vance's best films is more successful on interesting plot and art direction than none other than Michael Curtiz. This time a generally hated financier is found dead - struck in the head - in his locked bedroom upstairs. Philo Vance, hearing about the situation while he was about to leave for Italy, decides to interrupt his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone considers a suicide. William Powell is as affable as Philo Vance. He never seems to press and is always very calm in what he says and does. Powell is helped by a series of very talented actors - some first-rate actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as secretary of the dead, Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog, Arthur Hohl as the mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as the next-door blonde held, and two excellent performances by James Lee as the Chinese cook and portly Eugene Palette as a wise police detective. Add to the mix a wonderfully comedic twist of Etienne Girardot as a medical examiner who always misses his meal. It's this depth of suspicion and a story that has many twists that make The Kennel Murder Case a fun and fast mystery.
