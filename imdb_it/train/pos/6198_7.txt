I'm one of those people who crawl for a mile through broken glass to watch a Hal Hartley movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my favorite from Hartley) NO THING, Hal's exclusive film brand is an acquired taste. The infusion of equal parts mystery / espionage with a slight comedy seems to be his forte. Comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often passes through an entire scene before it comes to fruition. And this is the case of FAY GRIM, the sequel to Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey plays Fay Grim, abandoned wife of Henry Fool and mother of Henry's only daughter, Ned. Fay lives a quiet life until he returns home one day to find a CIA agent in his kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN OF THE YEAR) and he wants Henry's notebooks. There are many notebooks by Henry Fool and previously it was believed that they contained nothing but crazy wanderings. Apparently there is much more to them. Secrets of finding weapons or paths for terrorists? Who knows, but Henry. The Fulbright agent tells Fay that her husband is dead, but this is soon assumed as a ploy to get Fay out of his house and look for Henry (and it works ... but not in the way they think). <br /> <br /> Fay fights several espionage rings to collect Henry's notebooks and search for it. He also makes a deal with the CIA to get Simon (James Urbaniak) out of jail from his brother (he had helped Henry escape the country in Henry Fool's original film.) More overlapping events occur in rapid succession: spy rings are shot at incident to death, Henry is discovered while being held in "security" by a jihadist, Fay frees his brother but unknowingly risks his son's life, and the CIA gets his just punishment for endangering Fay. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley obviously loves playing with themes. And he does it to the extreme here. Even the names of the characters (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have implicit meanings that are quite amusing. O over the top spy movies also have a lot of screen time, as guns explode in sequences of stop motion, they never hit our heroine even though she's in the right trajectory. <br /> <br /> Now that I have greatly praised this creation, I will say that the excessive portrait of Fay Grim by Parker Posey is not the best part of the film, and it's a shame considering how much time is on the screen. I realize that this was probably what Mr. Hartley wanted: an uncertain woman with hand gestures in the Italian extreme. But it was still painful to look at times. <br /> <br /> Even so, fans will probably devour Fay Grim and ask for more. Although this wasn't my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
