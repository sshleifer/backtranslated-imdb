I think the comments about the show are too exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a television program, what do they look for? It's for fun watching a show, unless it's a critic or a person who analyzes the story. But many of us are not and watch the shows to relax and have fun. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after a heavy day at the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with painting a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show can last so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever the comments later. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of the show is that anyone of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would resume a message no matter how childlike that message is. Jesse's speeches with Michelle are extremely moving, if not thought to be childish. <br /> <br /> In general I would say after seeing every Full House show, there is a contentment in your heart that rarely occurs after many other shows.
