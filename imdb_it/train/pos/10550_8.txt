I saw this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me that it doesn't have a distributor in the UK. Well, actually not, because this film is all that a Hollywood movie is not - original, creative, bizarre and funny. Today it seems that nobody really wants to see this type of film since, in the simplest terms, it does not conform to the generic conventions that most young viewers look for in a film. <br /> <br /> I have lod I wrote a review for the IMDb for years but I felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is not about anything, since the two main characters are immersed in their world of nothingness through a hatred for the world. The splendor here is how the director holds the interest for most of the execution time with only two characters and when the only staging is a half-house and a vast white and empty space. This is largely due to the stellar performances of the actors, who both offer great laughter and at the same time are able to add significant emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I would love to write more but I'm at a certain time limit. However I encourage anyone to give this film a try. A unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well executed way, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, a nice sound design and (quite) impressive visions that create a very funny film. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame that so few people know anything ...
