Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music movie that stares at Michael Jackson with several segments. I will evaluate each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the film with a music video. The music video is a Michael Jackson concert that performs the song "Man in the Mirror", the music video also shows montages of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and others. The first segment was a good choice to open the film and I really liked the editing of historical figures. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment at 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson's departure from the five Jackson to his solo career. The photomontage I thought was well done, I liked the animation they put into it and I also liked their choices of songs like "I I want you back, Beat it, Thriller, you can feel it and the way you make me feel". The only thing I wish they could have done a little better in one of the editing songs is "We are the world". The reason it is all you see is the raindrops and in those drops there are images of Michael Jackson and the chorus of celebrities, but it is a bit difficult to see the chorus. Apart from that, the segment is still good. I give him a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the Bad song. You are probably thinking that it is Michael Jackson's music video of bad, well yes and no. This segment is the music video but has been redone by Kids. The segment was nice but it wasn't as good as the other segments. I give him a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music film that takes place after the children's version of the villain called "Speed ​​Demon". The short film is about Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and dresses up as a rabbit and drives a motorcycle to try to get away from them. The claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts of the movie the Claymation characters seemed a bit fake when they interacted with real people. Even at the end of the clip from nowhere Michael Jackson's bunny costume comes to life and he dances with it. I liked the dance but it was like I was out of nowhere. I give him an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is the music video for Michael Jackson "Leave me alone". The music video talks about the media taking the nose into the personal life of Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson believes they won't leave him alone, no matter how innocent he is. The music video really speaks (but keep in mind that this happened before the harassment of children, this only concerns the voices about him in the 80s.) But I have not heard this video should be in this film because it is a film for children and I don't think kids will understand what they're singing. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 takes us to the main story of the entire movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wish star as a criminal character to protect children (including John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon) from an Evil Mobster named Mr Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The segment that I thought really brought the film especially when it danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The strange thing about the segment is why children who attend an adult man never explained why. Even the character of Joe Pesci talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why should you talk about drugs in a children's movie. Otherwise it was nice. My score for this segment is an 8/10 segment <br /> <br /> is the final segment of the entire movie. The end of the film is with Michael Jackson singing a Cover version of the Beatles song "Come Together" and then, during the film, we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael did a good cover of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to put in a good singer group with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This film is a good film by Michael Jackson, I think it really brings out the imagination of children. The film is almost as imaginative as the Beatles animated film "Yellow Submarine" if you like Michael Jackson and you are up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film. My overall rating for this film is 8/10
