I don't think I need to tell you the story. Because it has been said for years and years. So I will only share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five. From that moment on I was a Disney child in a good way. The animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but now it's part of its charm. Now, in the era of High School Musicals and computer-generated images, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and the magic essence of the first Disney movies. Fortunately I was born first and so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems no matter how old I am, back in that five-year-old looking at him on VHS. What is the real magic of Disney.
