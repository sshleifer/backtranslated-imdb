In reality this film was not so bad. Contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy of "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx in the role of Alvin, who was pretty good and even funny, but what surprised me most, was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He has a different character from what he usually does, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very understanding person, and in "Bait" the comedies almost the opposite, a man without emotions, which was nice to see. The only really bad thing about this movie is the various photos of the World Trade Center, which makes it maybe a bit dated. Overall, I thought it was a nice little movie!
