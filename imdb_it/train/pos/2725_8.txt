"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks of the famous Truman Capote novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by two unfortunate criminals. The film excels as a study of the characters of the assassins, in particular Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The cast includes a few recognizable names, but nevertheless the story is made reality. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. They play with each other effortlessly while Blake also has many opportunities to explore the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the cast is simply average and not worth being noticed. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received an Oscar nomination for both screenplay and directing. In my opinion, both were excellent, even if the script was wrong with some reckless narratives in the last stages. Also the cinematography nominated for the Oscar by Conrad Hall is first-rate, as is the editing. Also noteworthy is the jazz soundtrack by Quincy Jones which ensured the last of the four Oscar nominations for the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other detective films, this does not incite violence. Brooks turns murderers into pitiful characters rather than categorically condemning them. Whether you agree with this sentiment or not, the film presents an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the experience with which the technical aspects are managed.
