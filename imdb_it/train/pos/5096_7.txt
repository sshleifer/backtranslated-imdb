This is a tentacled remake (4 hours) of the story of Rider Haggard, with the usual woman added and a foreign subplot with Russian soldiers searching for a "Stone of power" buried along with the treasure of King Solomon. It is very well filmed, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of Africa, and very well acted. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is as attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help save his father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the head of the Russian soldiers (not mentioned in the IMDb list) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood cannot leave alone a good story when they adapt it, this is well told and, except that it is too long, I liked it. 6/10.
