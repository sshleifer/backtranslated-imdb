This is what I call a movie "pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi". There is nothing better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "mood" movie. These two genuine artists are at their best, as is the plot. <br /> <br /> Karloff does an incredible job as a scientist who sees himself caught in a grip of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was taken by the idea of ​​looking at a man while drowning in the three concepts mentioned above. I was saddened and at the same time I was fascinated by the two stars who made themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that begs for a remake. This time he put Harrison Ford in the role of Karloff and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland in the role of Bela Lagosi. It may be possible to do this almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Hollywood has ever produced. As I said, it's not better. There's no way.
