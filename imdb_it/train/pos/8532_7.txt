Lupine leaves for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It is a very nice place for Lupine, with the desert and that exotic and warm atmosphere. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this film is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a different place than Lupine. On the one hand, their classical dynamic together has been lacking, but it is a change of pace. Also, in this way, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko's rules in this. For the duration of the film, he is seducing Lupine and us spectators. Then there is Lara, the maid of this particular story, and she is quite nice. This has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun distinction to have. <br /> <br /> There is a very funny womanish ninja who is the best villain in this, and of course he has some great fighting with Goemon, as well as some funny scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also on a war path here, in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> Practically, this is a fluid ride with Lupine. The plot is average and there are some slow points, but all in all this film is a real pleasure. To enjoy.
