It's a good thing I rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site. It was a wonderful film that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck has a leading role. I would like to tell viewers that they have not seen the movie go ahead and buy it. I rate it right there with the Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich manager very well. The things he says and does is just how I would imagine a person with too much money to act. The movie is much more fun than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks. It also has a good storyline and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, that you can't buy love with money.
