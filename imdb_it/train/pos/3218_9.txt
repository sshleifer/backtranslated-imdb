Nine out of ten might seem like a high grade to give for a science fiction film right to the video that was slandered at the US box office and criticized all around as the poorest film in Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all when you read the negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the woody nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier. I will also start from here, with my surprising claim that this is perhaps the best piece of acting that saw Russell pull out. Todd is an emotional paralytic and suffers from intense PTSD - this film was written before the phenomenon was widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> The portrait is perfect. Todd is retired, not communicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety, which adapts to the feverish tone of the training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper focus brings with him the inability to understand the larger continuum in which the tasks he is assigned to sit on - there is a scene in which he cuts the carrot slices and continues to work impassively, without cleaning the cut or blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical hardness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the required task from memory - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables he is preparing and the food that will be ate later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is, to say the least, spartan - the two great talking scenes he gets are fundamental to the film's plot and both underscore the squalid nature of his existence. We are told about fear and discipline. Always. Fear of keeping him pumped into a state of hyper-alarm where the smallest detail won't pass by him, keeping him ready to react on the razor's edge. Discipline to keep it under control through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the embrace of Sandra of Nielsen - but I believe you have to interpret it from the point of view of a human who is only the experience of a hug in combat - the tremor represents that he suppresses his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being caught, its movement and vision are limited - Fear and Discipline. <br /> <br /> Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to pull society junkers when they have served their conditions. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in the USA it can only be worse. Russell quickly collects the cloak of Mace's responsibility towards his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high probability of death. <br /> <br /> Then there is also the military subtext - the conflict between the Church of Busey and the HQ hotshot, Mekum. The new men of Mekum are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Each of them could hit Todd in the ground - but it's not about the tools you have, but how you use them. An incentive Todd, given the freedom to exercise his initiative and to act without the paralyzing effect of perceived superiority, uses ambush tactics and devious tricks to cut a new unit - sent without support, cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot compensate for a failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other delicate issues. When a film is shot and written so little, it leaves a lot of white space so that your performances can take root. Look at Soldier with an open mind and watch what he teaches you.
