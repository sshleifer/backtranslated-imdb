This Peabody Award-winning episode is one of the highlights of season 1 in which a hologram bridge malfunction traps Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and a Starfleet historian named Waylan in a San Francisco context of the 1930s. This episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler's "Maltese Falcon" where Patrick Stewart takes on the role of Humphrey Bogart - complete with fedora and trench coat. The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one contained in Bogey's "Maltese Falcon". <br /> <br /> This episode also introduces us briefly into a mysterious breed of insect called Jarada that communicates mainly with a high-pitched buzz. Communicating with this alien race is difficult, and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in their native language so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. The best part of this episode, however, is the appearance of the famous Hollywood actor B Lawrence Tierney as the gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a handsome man in the 1940s. Oh good...
