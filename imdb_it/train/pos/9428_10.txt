One of my favorite films to date begins as an adventure through the wild side of a four-man Atlanta team. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse river before it turns into a lake comes from the Lewis of Burt Reynold, who unconsciously drowns his boys in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film looks rather like an action movie, the second part takes the viewer into a completely different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In bad ways. At the end of the film, each person will be forced to face the scars of what must have been a nice weekend on the river, but turned into a struggle for survival. The film (with the exception of some fairly obvious goofs) is very well directed and beautifully filmed in a paradise of nature that takes your breath away. Photography is also excellent. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can spoil four different lives related to the same mistake in different ways.
