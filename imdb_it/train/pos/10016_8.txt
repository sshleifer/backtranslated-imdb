If there is one thing to recommend about this film, it is intriguing. The premise certainly attracts the public because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are indications that there is something dark lurking. However, there's not a lot of tension, and Williams's mild way of interpreting doesn't do much to connect us with his obsession with the boy. <br /> <br /> Collate the rates much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production was rushed and the holes are obvious. It certainly looks like a preview of a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something really nice for having inspired at least one commendable effort.
