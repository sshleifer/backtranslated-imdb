This is a series of cartoons in which most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells etc. I will not try to explain it in further detail, you will simply have to see it for yourself: I will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him as a child in the 1980s (with Swedish voices). I talked to some people who were also children in the 80s and who loved them too! I must admit that the educational part of the episodes did not reach me consciously, but the idea of ​​educating children while having fun is wonderful. I've seen a few episodes recently; there is a humor and a heart in it that it is difficult to find in other programs for children nowadays. <br /> <br /> 5/5
