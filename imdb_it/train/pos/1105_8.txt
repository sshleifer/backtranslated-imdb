The inhabitants of Manhattan apartments must endure all kinds of inconveniences. The worst is the lack of closet space! Some people who eat all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as warehouses because the cabinets are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comic writing team of that era, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins' novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel, and the two daughters, must share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, made it! When he sees an advertisement for the living Connecticut, he decides to take a look. Obviously, an owner for the first time, Jim is deceived by the real estate entrepreneur to purchase the dilapidated house that is inspected by an unscrupulous agent. This is just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever may be wrong, it goes wrong. The architect is asked to come out with a plan that does not work for the new house after the original has been razed to the ground. As one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever the original cost, it ends up with an inflated price that Jim could not afford. <br /> <br /> The film is fun because three principles in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and made the most out of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was an adorable actress who had always been effective acting alongside Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, who became a lawyer for the Blandings, is gentle and casual, as Melvin Douglas played. One of Blandings' girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who bears a strange resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but she doesn't have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie look much better. The management of H.C. Potter is light and has succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.
