This is a high-level Finnish film this year, although Tango Kabaree is approaching. The director Lampela did another good movie called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista a couple of years ago (I was in love with a desperate woman). Joki is a very realistic film on a Saturday afternoon in a small village / city. Actors are perhaps not so beautiful or beautiful but they act magnificently. I really hope that many of them get the JUSSI statue (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this film could do it abroad too.
