<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, even if it's fun if you don't find the references, like a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> I didn't see much of the much-hyped CB4, but what I saw didn't have the heart that has this little assailant. <br /> <br /> I have no news of the people involved since then, which is a surprise. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think that many dialogues, even if priceless in Tap are more fun here, probably because I'm more fond of rock, so my opinion cloud that point. <br /> <br /> Rap songs are fun to die for, and it's basically the benchmark for most of the movie, not all of them are in-your-face, which means physical comedy and le one - liners have priority over take-offs. <br /> <br /> Very fun, to watch twice if there's ever been a movie.
