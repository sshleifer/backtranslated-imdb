This is really a film that warms the heart. He won the George Peobody Award, winning "Roots", so he could tell you something about the essence of this movie. I have been searching on the Internet for how to order this film since my ex-father-in-law, Eugene Logan, co-author of this film, has been dead for some years, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would like to have his only grandchildren, my daughters, see this movie, as well as pass on this wonderful story to his great-grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven when it was aired on television and since then I couldn't wait to see it again. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I don't want to "spoil" this movie for you.
