This 2004 Oscar candidate is a very short black and white film in Spanish. A young woman walks into a cafe, takes a coffee and notices a couple of musicians who are silent with their instruments. All customers are immobile, like mannequins. A boy, however, is quite cheerful and sneaks into a song about what happens at 7:35 am. There is one amazing moment after another until the end which is quite, well, surprising. The people, the place, everything seems pretty ordinary. And like the musical piece "Bolero", the thing continues to build up to the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and wit, it is an 8-minute masterpiece.
