If you went to see this movie for the presentation of a great academic ... oh, well ... but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it ... Jim Carey was amazing as usual. The plot was fantastic, some added parts like the Grinch story made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat .. But although there were some ADULTS and added divisions, this is supposed to be a show for children or family. Try not to lose sight of that ... if you really do not like the movie ... and as for the comments on Ron Howard, try to direct an important film and see how you do it .. it is not as easy as it seems ...
