Again, it seems to me completely illogical, at least for me, that "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece is the totally "unlikely" if not "impossible" fusion of wildly different elements. That he managed to make alcoholism laugh rather than tear out tragic tears is wonderful in itself. Which gave Dudley Moore his most beautiful role, and every other cinematic element here in its optimal impact, including the score, seems to me pathetic and egregious. I challenge anyone to sit in this movie and not laugh out loud. But, apparently, almost a third of his audience is so successful. Well, I, for example, found and found Gordon's effort to be both ridiculous and lovable, and the considerations of Stephen Elliott's brilliant and enormous parent, brilliant murderer of Geraldine Fitzgerald's father-in-law characters. Even the black driver managed to escape condescension, and the late Syrian Gielgud was right to accept his compensation, but he was wrong in playing his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Underztand", much less to rationalize, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not alcohol, are other drugs of choice, including meth, and addictions are only symptoms, not targets ), simply look in their own questioning way.
