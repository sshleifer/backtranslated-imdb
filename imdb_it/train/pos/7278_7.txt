Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that grabs you and doesn't give up until the end, especially when you see it as a child. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit that it is not so scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains many mysterious scenes (especially those with the eerie mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the film is without doubt the scene with grandfather and grandmother in their new camper; the rock scene is very exciting and quite scary. Even the scenes in which the main character discovers his mother's secret is rather terrifying. <br /> <br /> Okay, the acting in the film isn't that good, and the movie sometimes looks a little boring, but on the whole Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. Too bad that only a few people have seen this film, this film really deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all you Hollywood producers out there; If you want to redo a movie, do this again!
