I think this movie is very funny and horror. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this wonderful film was not successful, because it is very funny as a first part. I'm also sorry that, apart from this movie, I haven't seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she is an extraordinary actress with great potential. I hope that in the future I will see her in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comic actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can count on me. What can I add more? This is a fantastic and classic movie!
