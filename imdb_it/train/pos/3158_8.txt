There are too many new sitcom styles, but what works best is the old style with an audience and a set indoors. The 70s is a great example. When the show was broadcast, no one has ever heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, let alone teenagers wonderfully played by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests). I wish Topher would hang around because the show started on his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland of Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of actors has never been known to us, and it's a good thing because a celebrity cast member can ruin it. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend, Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly like the original Laurie, the replacement couldn't match her and I'm sorry for that. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the unfortunate but beloved father figure of Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlie's Angels. I love Brooke Shields who plays Jackie's mom. He really showed his talent as an actor before going to Broadway. This show was a pleasure with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer even if two of the cast members are leaving, but I hope they don't stay too long. I wish the show's creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, The Sun's Third Rock, had more success on Fox than on NBC who sabotaged their show. The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future.
