There is so much value in this film that it's hard to know where to start with praise. Allow me to begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrait of Reese Witherspoon. That his performance stands out in the excellent cast is really a praise. Robert Mulligan has rarely disappointed those of us who admired his work. Each frame of The Man in the Moon is proof of the making of a film at its best.
