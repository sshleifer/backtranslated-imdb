If you want fun ... and you just want to relax and enjoy ... bada Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started pretty well ... but it is Govinda who steals the show from his hands ... fantastic timing and good presentation of the dialogue ... it is inspired by bad boys ... but it has Indian Masala. .. people think they might be confused and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is directing and Govinda is in action ... should not raise any questions .... other recommended films of the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero n. 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
