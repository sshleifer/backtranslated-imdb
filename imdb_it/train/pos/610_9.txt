Although Stardust looks like a fantasy film with predictable endings and medium performances, it certainly isn't. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more a fairy tale than an adventure film. He has this magical aura from the beginning to the end of the film. The plot is well written and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Like any fairy tale, it has a bit of morality. Therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not ascend the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl who is superficial and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give Claire Danes extra credits. She literally shines in this film. His eyes have this spark that fits his character perfectly. Also, she and Cox have a chemistry that makes the movie's romance even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses, which make Stardust an interesting and high-class film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is FANTASTIC, magical settings and interesting plot. was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
