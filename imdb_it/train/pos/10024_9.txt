There are so many things to fall in love with Aro Tolbukhin for. In the mind of asesino (Inside the mind of the murderer), it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this film is like an exercise in the cinema but really, really well done. It is made with super 8, black and white photos, 35 mm, colors, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin is like a film made from a documentary or vice versa, that the most peculiar aspect transmits on the doubt that leaves you speechless, has it ever existed? The film follows the next life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he was captured and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentarists took an interest in this character, so they interviewed him before his death. Nowadays, other people have been involved and have done more research on the character. What we are witnessing - the film. <br /> <br /> For the main part of the story we are guided by a semi-slow phase to go and look into Aro's mind, mainly to decipher why he did what he did. However, the important thing is that filmmakers never give us a side view; they left judgment for all of us and even if we can understand their actions, we never justify them. Thus, the first semester is based on information gathering; later things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the film such an incredible strength (even tough it never became weak or boring). <br /> <br /> I don't mean - and I don't want to - ruin anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by chance you have this movie near you, believe me, the journey to see it is more than worthy.
