I loved the way the EARTH is created. His photography is incredible, the change must have been an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. Moreover, his music and his sound editing make the Earth a profound experience not to be missed. You really are on a journey that you would probably never end up on your own. <br /> <br /> And even if, at the beginning, I was rather surprised by the audience's laughter as we see animals in their daily struggle for survival, sometimes I couldn't help laughing. Nature simply seems too awesome to understand. <br /> <br /> But rather than the need for laughter, I left a profound question in the cinema: "How can 200 years of industrial revolution destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?" br /> <br /> With this question in mind, you will understand how I felt a little bitter and powerless after seeing the EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we've gone through over the last few centuries and to stop global warming at once (all this not being an NGO activist at all!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing destiny .... (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed not to find direct answers to my questions. Yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle that its crew went through. <br /> <br /> I hope the cut in my energy consumption does it. I do not know how else to shorten the distance that polar bears have to swim to reach the earth before drowning or attacking animals that cannot beat in their state of exhaustion ... <br /> <br /> An inspirational film it is , but I didn't leave the cinema very happy.
