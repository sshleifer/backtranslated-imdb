I don't know what it is, I find it so captivating in this film, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war dramas, but I was really wondering how and when Winfield would find his son. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. Actually, I haven't seen this film in years, nor been shown on TV for a while, but this film is somehow the odyssey of a man after the war. Winfield shows a very nice and exciting portrait of a man lost in his memories. There is a basic message in this film that is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he faces. Because this film is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
