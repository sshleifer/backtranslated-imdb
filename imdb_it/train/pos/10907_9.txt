I was walking around the TV and HBO was showing a double blow to incredibly horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to her twin sister and said, "Hey, it sounds fun," - I really love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought that Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that because of his condition, he never went through puberty, so the high voice and the smallest body. He was in a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, watched a little more, I laughed, I got up to get another Kleenex, then I cried again. Once the "time was up" of Jonni Kennedy, he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and was free. I highly recommend it. If you don't fall in love with this boy, you have no heart.
