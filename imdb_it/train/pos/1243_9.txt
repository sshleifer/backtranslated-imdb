From time to time Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a film like "the golden child", in particular. This is a movie you would have imagined could have played Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone. But Eddie really works; he is intelligent, he is funny, he is brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything else should be a hero. <br /> <br /> Having been chosen to protect a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied to perfection by Dance), Eddie goes from California, Nepal and back, while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if it's all he says he is and a crazy old saint (Wong, perfect as always) knows he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, breathtaking at times, shocking and, of course, fun. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start a movie by making rude comments behind a guy who reads a porn magazine and ends it with clever comments about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "Child" ": it is a search for" gold ". <br /> <br /> Nine stars.
