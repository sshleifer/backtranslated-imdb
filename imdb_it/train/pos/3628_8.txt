The film had many fundamental values ​​of family and love. He expressed human emotions and it was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children) and it was fun and funny sometimes. There were some loaded symbols to look for. Cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many filmmakers made today (which quite frankly is warning a little). It was clearly shot but had a good soft quality. Although the editing could have been done better, I thought it was a nice film for a family. And the organization of information has just been launched against you, which was something I didn't like, but in all it was a good movie.
