A first-class Columbo from beginning to end. I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the murderer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an avid Columbo fan, I can't remember another one in which he didn't create the killer in the end he does in other episodes. In this, while he is trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the "message" that his nephew left, he finally stands up to him. <br /> <br /> Even the music in this episode is very good, as it is in many others.
