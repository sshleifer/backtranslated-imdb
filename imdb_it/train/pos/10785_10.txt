I saw it when I was little and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mices where cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was fun. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too many sweets. It's sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo who beats Meecy Mices on the head and then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few desires and then turns into a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent children will love this show, new words, songs and watching them play.
