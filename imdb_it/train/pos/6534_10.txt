I had heard that this movie was great from many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was great, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations! He had fun parts, he entertained me with action and all the guys who tried to kill her, and Emma Roberts was fantastic like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was also very good. I highly recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why those guys were trying to kill us ?!" Corky: "Yes, I was also asking myself. Actually, it's almost implying me!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate it when people try to kill me. It's so rude!" <br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
