Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous comedy of vaudeville, Lewis and Clark, who hadn't spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took him personally and has held a grudge since then. This is the premise of this fun game by Neil Simon turned into a movie. Sure, what makes Matthau and Burns so good in their best moment, and the material is more fun than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines like Matthau's nephew and agent. There are also old clips of real stars of the golden age to get you into the film, and the character actor Fritz Feld starts it all with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who debuted in the 1930s in the theater with Orson Welles and later was her grandmother in "Family Matters", is big in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with it (and maybe I'm being too fussy and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they meet for the first time. Of course, he has had a lot of resentment over the years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or simply bad manners. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau acting that way in other movies, but not George Burns. And Matthau's bellow tends to get a little old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a constantly fun movie to help and forget your problems, put "The sun boys". They will lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slide it". <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to slide it."
