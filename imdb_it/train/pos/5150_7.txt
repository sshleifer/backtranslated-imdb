Although Ian Kershaw has distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies regarding Hitler's life and yes, this is dramatized, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his last years, during this documentary that deals with Hitler from childhood to become Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of Long Knives. This TV movie (also a two-part miniseries) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, eg. the 1930 financial disaster. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and little else, apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, precious and full of interesting actors, yet I feel that it should have been more closely directed to a stronger cinematography; most of the actors are portrayed in half-length shots that (for me) create a theatrical, not cinematographic, attitude. The weather is sometimes drowsy, and the film suffers, being about 2.5 hours long.
