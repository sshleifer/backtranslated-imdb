Gandhi My Father is a well made film. It describes well the life of Gandhiji's eldest son, Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand alone, his failure, his ego .. Akshaye Khanna completely justifies the role of Harilal. Only not him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhi on the screen I've ever seen. But I will cut three points because there have been few shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was fifteen to twenty minutes longer than it should have been. Secondly, the film needed further research on the character of Harilal. Somewhere, the character seemed incomplete. Furthermore, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. No other son of Gandhiji was mentioned in the entire film. I believe that the character like Harilal should have at least some differences among his brothers, considering the selfish nature of Harilal. However, despite some shortcomings, I liked the film.
