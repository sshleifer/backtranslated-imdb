I liked this movie. It was nice. It has everything: cars, shootings, fights and even a symbolic girl. It doesn't excel in any of these things, except cars. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, some smooching around, and a lot of car, with a big chase towards the end. The jump, we can say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so the film is not as bad as people paint it. It has some quality and I enjoyed watching it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I didn't need to turn off my brain to watch it. I didn't always think "Is it possible?" or tramp like that. 9 out of 10.
