I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the film's plot was realistic and relevant to any period in American history. There is always that woman who does what she has to do to climb the class system. I feel that the character of Lilly was portrayed correctly and could not be better done. What I liked most was when she realized what love really was. Throughout the film, all the men who fell in love with her fell in love with her, gave her everything, even lost their careers for her. Until he met Cortland, he didn't understand why these men gave up everything for happiness. The way her life was over was far from what she expected to be possible. I would recommend this film to anyone with a mature audience, so you can understand the content and meaning of the film and the plot upside down.
