The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are noted in their wonderful "A Matter of Life and Death". It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell who played at the Walter Reade in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films from this, or from any other era. <br /> <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" has a brilliant photograph of Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to work miracles with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast between the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in the sky and the colored ones when the action returns to earth. This was a good shot and well ahead of his time. The black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where Peter and the Conductor are chatting must be one of the most incredible things about each film. <br /> <br /> Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment will be on the great acting that Powell and Pressberger got from the cast of great personalities, who responded magnificently to the direction of the directors. <br /> <br /> David Niven, is Peter, whose plane is hit and his best a friend dies because of it. This film marked one of the highlights of Mr. Niven's career. He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this film. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June, the woman who talked to Peter while his plane was falling from the sky. As fate would have it, Peter and June fall in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British film actors honor this film with their presence. Robert Coote is Bob, the man who is admitted to heaven, but is surprised that his friend Peter has never made the trip with him. An excellent turn from Marius Goring, who as a conductor 71 steals the film. Mr. Goring, who has worked with the directors, is one of the best things about the film. Also, Roger Livesey, like Dr. Frank Reeves, makes one of the best appearances of his career, as does Raymond Massey, who is seen as Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" is a timeless film that will always be viewed with gratitude to its creators.
