When his DVD was released, I came on the market and bought it. And I think my money was the right way I expected before buying it. Great movie what else can I say for Will Smith, he was a fantastic actor as always in action movies or series. It always gives a record braking performance. I think this is the movie after August Rush that makes a person cry while watching it. The way the director described the story was really cool. His previous life and new life in the film have been correctly developed for the public. I also couldn't find any flaws in the story or the way they turned it. I think his DVD should be a family because this will really be a good thing for your collection. It is not the film that needs popcorn to have fun, this is the film that allows the public to learn a lesson. now what is the lesson you can see as you watch. And I advise those people who are movie critics, please look at this if you could find some criticism about this movie, please talk to me.
