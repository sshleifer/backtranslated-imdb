Watching Before The Devil is one of my best experiences ever in the cinema. I was intrigued by my mixed response to the film - and to me, opinion extremes indicate that the film touched something that was embraced or disavowed by the general public. It's one of those movies that stayed with me, and I keep thinking about it and thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Surely the DVD will still illuminate some themes and elements of film production? Among these: the Sidney Lumet film, the time-shifting technique in storytelling, the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and the reason why it works so well, the masterful direction, the relatively rare focus that Hollywood films give to male characters and to they fight to become an open control book for their women, the undertone, but still resonant performance of Marisa Tomei, and, of course, the superb Hoffman with that central monologue on the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Phew! Definitely a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment watching the highly anticipated DVD - just to find no comments, nothing behind the scenes, no interviews, nothing extra. <br /> <br /> Hey - distributors - solve the problem!
