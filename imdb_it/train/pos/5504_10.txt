I only saw it last night, it was broadcast on the "Passionate Eye" series by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was screened recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival and many others. It is a truly remarkable film. The filmmakers literally came across the story, being there to make a documentary on Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves right in the middle of the events as the blow took place. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, they let the story unfold as it happens. They obviously have their own ideological perspective (which makes it clear), but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on events, people, the background and the history that led to the coup. As a film, it's not revolutionary in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think it's the way it should be. What we can see is what "embedded" journalism should be. What we see is an exceptional tale of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who takes care of his people ... a history of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / god interests media combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
