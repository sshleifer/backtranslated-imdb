I'm a C & C fan, going back to their records, and I liked this movie, but at some point in the mid-80s on cable television in San Jose, California, it was broadcast with an alternative storyline that has destroyed the whole point of the film. All references to marijuana have been replaced with "diamonds". The bag that "Red" drops in Chong contains diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same ("... worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot in which clips of aliens were added to a ship by looking at C & C, and talking to each other about getting diamonds. In the end, instead of "space coke", it's something else. I'm not sure who made this version, but it was horrible and obvious that they were trying to make it familiar / child-friendly. It would have been better if that network had never aired it.
