This cute animated short has two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is the bald guy, a bit burly of comics who never talks. <br /> <br /> Well, talk here! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet shop, and when he thinks of the shop - some hilarious hijinks ensue. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets, Henry enters a battle with birds and a monkey, but in the end it all works out.
