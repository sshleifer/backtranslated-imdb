An entertaining Batman animated film. Not on par with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but still solid. I liked the way the movie made you guess who Batwoman was. There was a nice breakthrough. Beautiful action sequences. I have always been of the opinion that Batman cartoons are better than all the sequels of Batman live action. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
