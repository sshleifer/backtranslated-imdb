Yesterday I went to the cinema alone, because here in Mexico, more often than not films from other countries are part of the so-called "alternative cam√°ra" (alternative camera). But after seeing this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I really enjoyed this film .. which in the end I was happy .. this film is a small spoon of hope in these days. And the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music .. especially the main song of the film .. Cosas que hacen vida la la worth it .... Excellent song! !!
