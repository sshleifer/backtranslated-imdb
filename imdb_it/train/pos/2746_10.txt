Imagine turning off the lights on your remote farm on a cold night and then going to bed. It is not necessary to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind that hisses through the trees. Some time after midnight a car with the lights off a few inches from the driveway. Moments later, an intruder beams a torch in your darkened living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farm ... at night. Based on the Truman Capote bestseller and with B & W lighting comparable to the best noir films of the '40s, "In Cold Blood" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first act, as the plot takes place mostly at night and on the rain soaked by the country roads. It's stuff for nightmares. But this is not a dream. The events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two scammers with heads full of disappointment kill an entire Kansas family, looking for a stash of money that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks used the real places where real life events occurred, even the farm ... and its interior! It is a memorable and disturbing film. <br /> <br /> Both main actors closely resemble the two murderers of real life. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a tramp, who dreams of finding Cortez's buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the casual scam artist with an all-American smile. <br /> <br /> After their murderous madness, the duo goes to Mexico. Things go wrong there, so they come back to the United States, steal cars, hitchhike and are generally unhappy as they wander from place to place. But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws will soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the film are mesmerizing, with the rain falling, the rope tightens and all we hear is the beating of a beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with its trivial medium act, "In Cold Blood" stages in compelling detail a real life story that still hypnotizes, almost half a century later. It's that setting that does it. Suppose people in rural Kansas leave their doors open ... at night?
