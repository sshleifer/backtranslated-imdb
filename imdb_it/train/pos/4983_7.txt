A short subject SHIRLEY TEMPLE. <br /> <br /> You will be able to become powerful at the Buttermilk Pete's Cafe when the local contingent of WAR BABIES diapers will be on the scene for the midday milk break. <br /> <br /> This is the little primitive film - a parody of military films - it offers a few giggles, but little else: small friends who talk hard can start to ball in a short time. Shirley Temple, who plays a French rocket that rocks her hips, doesn't have much to do in this pre-celebrity show. Highlights: the true signs of infantile temperament when some children wake up unexpectedly and are really soaked in milk. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, short subjects with one and two wheels were useful to the Studios as important training bases for new or growing talents, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamic for creating a short, successful subject was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a first-class story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and planning and capable of representing a wide range of materials, the short subjects were the perfect complement to the films of the Studios.
