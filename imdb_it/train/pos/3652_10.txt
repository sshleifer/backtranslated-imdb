I started watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another stupid airplane crash movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that goes far beyond the quality of most TV movies. He might even have made his big screen debut. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns into one of her best interpretations as a medical specialist for the CIA, and Jane Leeves of Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is well written and the story is compelling everywhere. In fact, the final hour is so full of twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second. If you have the chance to watch this movie, invest the time - almost four hours. You will be amply rewarded!
