The movie "Men in White" is certainly one of the most entertaining, if not the most comical, comedy films I've ever seen! (and I've seen a lot!) It's about two cleaners, who become "Men in white" and then stop an invasion from space. It is also a parody of many classic films, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Stranamore". Anyone who says this movie is lousy has something wrong with it. There are a lot of funny gags and jokes here, and you could really hurt your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly won't regret it!
