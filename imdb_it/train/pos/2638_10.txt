One of the best films for all ages. You will never be able to watch LION KING again without thinking about the extra story that this film adds. Almost 40 years, I saw him with my wife and two children after work tonight and I didn't laugh and I enjoyed a movie so long. <br /> <br /> Take some time and watch it with the children. It will remind you of how Disney was when you were young.
