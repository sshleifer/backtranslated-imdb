Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player who attempts a return to a tournament hosted in Italy. His brilliance is undisputed, but his obsession with chess has halted his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same town with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) to discover possible marriage partners. Vera leans towards a handsome count, but, surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met during a walk. Sascha is also taken with Natalia and proposes marriage in their second meeting. But with the concentration that Sascha must give to chess games and, with other events in his past that continue to cause problems, will Natalia's heart win? Oh, and can he become the chess champion too? This is an adorable film, based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is amazing, with Watson very beautiful, while the beautiful and rich girl and Turturro express perfection as the shy and clumsy chess enthusiast. James makes a nice turn, while the overbearing mother and other cast members are wonderful. As for the appearance of the film, it couldn't be better. The scenery is very special, the vintage costumes are fantastic and the cinematography deserves a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, sometimes, making it a film that not everyone will appreciate. Furthermore, the finish is bittersweet. However, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenarios or the refined art of filmmaking, don't miss this one. You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of spells.
