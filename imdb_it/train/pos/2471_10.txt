I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before looking at it but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow the dialogue through it. My vision of the film could be partial, since I had never read the script before, but I was caught in the understanding of this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who ever lived and the story of Hamlet is certainly one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now to the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found that all the actors in the film had a clear understanding of what they were saying and therefore were able to articulate it quite well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the king. The thing I liked most is that it worked very well as "MOVIE" and not like a game you are studying. It is not necessary to be rich with Shakespeare to relate to the whole village of Misery. I would recommend this film to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> They are my two cents.
