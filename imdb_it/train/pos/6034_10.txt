Last November, I had the chance to watch this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a lot of fun. Apart from a few technical errors, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the guy who played the main role. There is a lot of heart in this film, a lot of spirit. I had the chance to talk to some of the directors after it was done, and they looked really nice. All in all, the whole film was just a positive experience, and I would definitely recommend it. The story was fun and interesting, as a woman I had many of the same problems as the main character and I could really understand his problems because of that. The film does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. Friends in the film are really well written, they are realistic. I know people like these, I just wish my friends and I could look as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is really cool, I wish there were more movies out there. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
