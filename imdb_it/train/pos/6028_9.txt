This is the film in the middle of Antonioni that most critics quickly dismiss, as an "imperfect" aspect of American youth culture / politics of the 1960s. For what it's worth, I found it more moving and memorable than his most acclaimed films like THE ADVENTURE, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a frame for Antonioni's brilliant observations and for his criticism of American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture and the whole anti-establishment and anti-war reaction that was so important then . <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a very elaborate film; from the sequence of the opening credits to the bizarre "love-in" of the desert, to the use of billboards and up to the cathartic and stunning finish that used 17 camera set-ups (in its own way, as powerful as The Wild's climax Bunch). Moreover, Antonioni has chosen one of the protagonists of Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever on the screen. There is not much "acting", as it looks more like a docu-drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals like the guiding couple works quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only full of wonderful music, but its use is also impressive (I can't forget the beginning of the film, above all thanks to the selection of music - by Pink Floyd - which governs the graphics so well). <br /> <br /> Contrary to public opinion, this is a nice achievement in the cinema, and I would recommend it enthusiastically to anyone with a taste or tolerance for taste. It is worth looking for it and one of those key films of the 60s that requires a DVD restoration / release.
