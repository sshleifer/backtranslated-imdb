I saw it with subtitles as in Russian, but I liked it a lot. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger pushed him to do mortal things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him and ended up in a deadly battle. There was a good dose of cold blood, but not too much for the weak stomachs. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the old Hollywood movie, but for those who love independent films. I had the feeling of an Asian fantasy movie.
