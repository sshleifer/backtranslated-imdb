There was some hesitation on my part about what this movie had to offer. To begin with, the casting didn't seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in "24" and the preview did not seem to offer anything inspiring for him or the public. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and the rest does not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the film is finally finished, I wasn't completely sorry for seeing a decent thriller that could have been much better, the responsible parties took a little more attention to look at the narrative gaps and gave a little more attention to character development. We have already seen threats of this kind and this has made the main conflict much more difficult for writers. As a public, we no longer want to repeat the same old story. We want to see something different, be excited and have fun. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with casting. From the lovely first lady of Kim Basinger. It carries itself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable. Michael Douglas did it and did it before. Unfortunately, the president is far less than an entity that cares about his destiny. Sutherland redefines his "24" approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does a passable job like the newcomer. <br /> <br /> Do not expect so many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave out your expectations and enjoy the journey for what it could be. All right.
