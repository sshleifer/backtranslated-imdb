I waited to see this film for a long time and finally managed to see it at the Istanbul Festival. Maybe because I was expecting too much from this movie and that's why I was a little disappointed. I wasn't the best Korean film, but it's really worth watching. <br /> <br /> The subject was beautiful and the film keeps you watching without getting bored, even if it's long. But there are gaps in the film and you jump from one point to another. However, the acting of Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in the history of cinema and I think this film wouldn't be nice if it wasn't in the main role.
