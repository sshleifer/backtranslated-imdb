Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite shows in T.V's life: I used to watch episodes every day when I came home from school. So far I think I've seen every episode at least once and the entire series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenager / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all refer to. It's fun, smart, extrovert, witty and more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick adapt very well to the part of Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda, the crazy and extravagant, make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I must admit that the university years are not as good as his high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't good yet. I think the ending was fantastic even though it wasn't what I was hoping for, it made sense and I liked it anyway. :)
