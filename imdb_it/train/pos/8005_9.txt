I purchased this game on eBay after hearing that it was a game similar to Elite. The gameplay is really very similar, and it's very exciting. After playing it a couple of times, I immediately returned to eBay and bought copies for all my children so that they could also join in the fun ... I played this game and the plot makes it feel like you're actually in a film, it's brilliant. If you have trouble feeling free to explore due to the restrictive nature of the plot in the single player game, simply set up a Freelancer server on your PC (easy to do and the software is included) and play at your leisure. There is still a huge number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is not a problem and it's not that threatening, because often you don't mean other players unless you want to. So go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single player campaign, then set up an online presence and have fun. The depth of this game is stunning, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to discover, as well as all kinds of other things to discover: hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and above all how you can get for a couple of quid on eBay. Get one with the complete manual written if you can (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it's much better!
