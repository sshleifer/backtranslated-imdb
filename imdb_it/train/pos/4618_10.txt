I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could tell it. This will be a movie that I would show my children to let them know, the feelings they are having are normal. It's fun to see how we could be so devastated by things at such a young age ... that we knew we'd be back ... again and again .... Great movie !!!!
