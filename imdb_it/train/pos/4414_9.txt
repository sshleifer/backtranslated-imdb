Cuban Blood is one of those sleeping films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I saw him while sailing to Cuba on a cruise in the western Caribbean. Describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and in 1959 during the revolution. Not much time has passed in the revolution until the end, when the socialist regime arrived and took ownership of the boy's father. Most of the film is the boy's adult age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A film with acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story without special effects or great schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie that is worth watching several times a year.
