I went in search of this movie in the typical fan obsession. I just wanted to take a look. I didn't expect much of anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? It is not possible that so much skill resides in one person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The plot and the characters are not lost in the typical Hollywood special effects. History captures your emotions and drags you. As the credits pass, you suddenly realize that you have been pasted to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the acting seems a bit exaggerated. However, I believe it is done with comic intent and very appropriate for the character. Otherwise, I never expected the level of acting to be witnessed. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly for something I've lost or forgotten for the first time or two around. <br /> <br /> I absolutely recommend this movie. Feel free to come in with your doubts, but I'm sure you will find a place on your shelf.
