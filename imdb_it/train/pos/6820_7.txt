The film was much better than claimed by the other review. It's a nice family film. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to go back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, nobody believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. He finds and befriends a girl about his age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. He is also able to help his relationship with his father in the long run. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. He seemed more aimed at children about 6-12 years old (maybe a little older) and is practically classified as PG or G. I am an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" film - I imagine the other reviewer does not it is.
