When the Chamberlain family camps near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her child being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should try. Because it seems that the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus. Lindy does not help things either because she does not play the jury or the courtroom, she is only herself, and it is a hard one to burst, so obviously everyone thinks she is guilty because there is proof that no light has come. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps his wife. It is beautiful (or bad) to see that people are just as prejudicial and stupid elsewhere as they are in the United States, because the Australian public does not believe that history and the media are only passionate about flames. Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a lifetime of forced labor, but years later a missing proof comes out and is released, but not before the family's life is fundamentally ruined. A compelling story, very well done, a little long but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
