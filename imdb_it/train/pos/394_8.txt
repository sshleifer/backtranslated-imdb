This is an incredible comeback from the film director, Tsui Hark. It is one of the few films that deserves to be a face-to-face meeting with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the film started, there were astronaut backgrounds on each side that were <br /> <br /> depicted in superb style. If you are a Chinese martial artist or a geek, you will love the excessive amount of many 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There, comes a beautiful performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung who plays "Sky King". He teamed up with Louis Koo (Red) who impressed me with his flexible "wing" that deflected incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were skilled in every way. Not only is the action superb but it has a rather complex plot. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of story / theme or simply "pushed into random pieces of debris" and even describe it as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer cannot rely on Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga cartoons to understand this film. The others who are famously with "Wu Xia" films will have a better foothold. In due respect there may be a weakness that could be expected. The blow that was delivered to the enemy in the last fight scene may have been carried out in a more substantial and devastating way. Nevertheless, it is a must see.
