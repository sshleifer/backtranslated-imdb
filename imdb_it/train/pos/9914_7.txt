Reviewed on September 9th 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This had an interesting premise but seemed to go too long with too many stacks of electronic waste stacks (computers, keyboards, cables, etc. recycled shipped by ton from China and then ordered and redone in new products to resell) and other desolations. <br /> <br /> The directors tried to get more interviews with people to increase the human element, but they were often prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was interesting. The pieces of a high-level real estate agent from Shanghai who pranced and flaunted exhibiting his luxurious villa and its gardens, especially the scenes of others living in medieval conditions, were particularly surprising. The tracking shot at the opening of a 480-meter factory was also quite good. The scenes of the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the TIFF films Jia Khang-je (the movie Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and the documentary Dong) that were built around this topic. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, director of photography Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was presented by the public and was thanked as the most important person who witnessed the access to the field in China.
