Pandora's Clock is one of the best thrillers you've ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you've ever seen. A very faithful adaptation of the novel by John J. Nance, which had a terrifyingly real scenario in the novel, is made even more true here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for TV, this is top notch entertainment. The cast is exceptional and slips so well into the characters of the novel that one might think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson comes out of the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is exceptional in the role of an ambassador's assistant in a role that shows she can be a dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is as exceptional as Dr. Sanders and although the character is a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and adapt to their novel counterparts to the letter. <br /> <br /> There are changes in the plot of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are better compared to the novel. The plot is realistic and can be seen in the way it was presented, making it the best film set on the plane from the original Airport film. Production values ​​are high and although special effects may look as good as a decade ago, they work well. The sets are fantastic, especially the CIA headquarters and the oval office show that the filmmakers spent a lot of time on this work. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter if you see it first and read and then read the novel or vice versa. Do both and you won't regret losing four hours for this movie and how long it will take to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.
