Exploding guns, exploding buildings, breaking cars, and it's only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action-packed film involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can't seem to die, no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Hard and trinket Gary Busey, usually played as a villain in these gentlemen films, has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued: after all he is carrying on the whole show. This does not mean that there are not many formidable support roles including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and many other "forgotten" character actors. <br /> <br /> There are action sequences small enough to contain the whole story: Busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" American military elites and return a high-tech "super-energy" (a normal tank with an addition of cheese - glued on top - back to the United States. <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killer machine more than the bad guys? This question is asked, of course, as in any CIA-focused film ... but without preaching.
