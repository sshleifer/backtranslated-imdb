I desperately need this on a tape, not on a DVD, and soon! I have a nephew who is in the infantry but is not yet deployed, even though he left to go to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved stepson in Ramadi Iraq 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone . I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring, because he, like his older brother, has an idealized and romantic idea of ​​what he needs in the army. My stepson died after only 10 days in the country and never came out for any mission, so my grandchildren have no way of referring to any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary by any kind of personal experiences that could have been transmitted by the my son now deceased. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do about those who are inside, or who have left, but I have one left who has not raised his hand and sworn in AGAIN. I desperately wish him to let him know, none of the others did. <br /> <br /> The conditions help me in this. <br /> <br /> The documentary film The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen. I need somehow to let my youngest grandson see what he is doing before it's too late. BUT: (don't laugh) I NEED my mother to see this first. He must really see and feel these men and women, not simply the idea of ​​them, but the truth about what they will be immersed in, perhaps forever. Then he will have the emotional determination to show my brother this film and, once he has it, then he can make sure that his son, my youngest nephew, looks at him too. So, my nephew could start taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> (((there is another time this will be shown on TV? if so please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is , my mother does not own a DVD player, she still uses the video (is that correct? With the tapes?) So, I need to find a way for her to be able to watch this movie. Can I buy it from anyone in that form? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in tape form from anyone? There is a legitimate link from which I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If yes, who would I contact? I will gladly pay the privilege of providing a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I will consider whatever you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I've already lost a very precious and beloved one, I already know that my oldest nephew will never be the same when he comes back and I could lose him too. I can't lose three and the emotional toll for all those who make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. Can you help me please. I'll be happy to call you, send me an email number if this is the best way to get the information you need. Thank you so much for the help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
