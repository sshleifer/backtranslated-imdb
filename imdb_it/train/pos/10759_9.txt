It is true that you always remember what you were doing at a time when disaster or tragedy strike. And no more than September 11, 2001, a date that changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary did not propose to dwell on the events that led to 9 / 11. Rather, the directors, the brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet, decided to make a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie firefighter from New York. They went to the academy and did some training shots, and carefully selected their "proby" (test fireman) to join them in a New York fire station, home of Ladder 1 and Engine 7 But their production was to develop and contain at that time, believed to be the only blow of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I was traveling with a friend on the train from a night of LAN games, and I received a call at around 850pm local time from my father, who informed me of the above. A few minutes later, he told me that there was another, and that the WTC was under attack. When I arrived home, the upper floors of the twin towers were on fire and in smoke, and to my horror they collapsed in less than an hour. The filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one that had followed a team during a routine call, and that immediately ran to the WTC listening and seeing the plane crash into it. We follow what is possible the only sequence of events filmed in the hall of WTC1, where the first firefighters, paramedics and police rescuers had to make sense of what happened and quickly develop an action plan. The other camera, held by the other brother, was heading towards the WTC to look for his brother, and along the way, he captured the many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten. > <br /> During the documentary there are numerous interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7, who miraculously did not suffer any casualties. But surviving has also caused its own series of psychological disorders, as they struggle to come to terms with the event. Through the events taking place, we learn of the strong camaraderie among these men who risk living and getting stuck every day on their work, to save lives. <br /> <br /> We started with what was supposed to be the documentary, before the day's events entered and became the focal point, until the rescue phase in which the hopes of finding survivors under the rubble are been kept alive by men working twenty-four hours a day to make sense of the collapsed steel structures. It's not a movie that was made, and what you see here can't be recreated in any other documentary (and skies, not stages for Hollywood movies). It is as close as possible to that day, to witness the event up close, by security. <br /> <br /> The code 1 DVD contains an additional hour of 4 series of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7.
