Yaitate !! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! It was shown in our country only recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. This is Azuma Kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He is working at the Pantasia branch of Southern Toyo and is also helping his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight other skilled bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different types of bread, but they also learn to cook more food. It's a really fun and unique anime because it also mimics characters from other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people from real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must for people of different ages.
