This movie is gorgeous. It is real and down to the heart, but at the same time totally crazy. The characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have so many different minds, but each of us could at least refer to it. In Canada, we don't have many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go see Loners.
