Several young Iranian women dress up as boys and try to participate in a qualifying match for the World Cup between Iran and Bahrain. When captured, they are written in an area where the game remains within earshot, but not in sight. The prisoners claim to be let go, but the rules are rules. <br /> <br /> Given the director's pedigree, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to find that Offside is a comedy, and often hilarious. In 1997, The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian childhood and leaves the public to wonder what is "real". In 2000, The Circle, several Iranian women left the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> However, thinking now of Offside, it is difficult to imagine it as something other than a comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous. While women ask to know why they can't watch the football game and their kidnappers have difficulty answering, the only possible result is comedy. <br /> <br /> What makes Offside more interesting is that young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply fans of soccer and patriots and, despite the fact that they are treated unfairly, they never lose their attention on the game and on the historic victory that is within the reach of their nation.
