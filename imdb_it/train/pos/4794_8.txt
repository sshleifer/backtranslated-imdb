It takes patience to overcome the eccentric of David Lynch, but - for a change - chronicle of affirmation of the life of Alvin Straight's journey, but he remains faithful. Even if he moves slowly as John Deere of Straight, when he meets strangers Gentiles during his pilgrimage we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and finally about the power of the family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth closes his career with the most genuine performance of the year, sad and poetic, flinty and thoughtful. And Sissy Spacek identifies him as his "slow" daughter Rose who torments herself for her private loss while caring for Dad. Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about the family.
