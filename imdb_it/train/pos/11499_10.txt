Since I was only a child when this show was originally broadcast, I just took the DVD set and I hope other episodes were shot. This show was a version of the '70s of the popular TV series of the' 90s "X-Files" - but with a slightly more comical / lighter approach. But don't get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which have rather crude conspiracies (left to the imagination, of course, this was television from the early 1970s). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots in which a little silly and acting, but this is the charm and attraction of this series. If you like yellow movies, comedies or sci-fi / horror themes, this series brought this together. Each episode worked about 50 minutes (1 hour with commercials) and 50 minutes are fast, leaving me more and more. A great classic show that is underestimated in my book!
