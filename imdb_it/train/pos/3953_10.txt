I saw this movie on TV when it came out and I never saw it again. For the life of me, I could not remember the title and ran into it while I was watching the credits of Roy Thinne. Excellent, dark and spooky television horror film in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the Dark"; and "Satan's School for Girls", everyone has lost the satanic classics. I also think he has many parallels with Clint Eastwood's classic "High Plains Drifter". Why don't they publish these fantastic little films, especially considering all the latest junk that fills the shelves of discount DVDs at Wal-Mart? Most of these films have a cult following, so sales shouldn't be a problem.
