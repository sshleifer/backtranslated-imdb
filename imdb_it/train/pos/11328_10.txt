This movie is fantastic. If you like to watch class B movies, that's it. This is a classic 80s college film, in which a song is played throughout the soundtrack. A horrible film, but worth renting for teasing, or just to watch the old ones come out of the cabinets with knives. A little strange, if you ask me.
