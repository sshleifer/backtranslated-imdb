A deplorable social condition triggers the catastrophe: an impoverished Giovanna ended up in the sewer, but she still has an ace up her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a tenant from the service station, who has been going on for years, takes her from the street and offers her bed and her house along with her clumsy affection. But the physical contact to which Giovanna is now exposed gives her only feelings of disgust, and consequently does not see a benefactor in him, but a tormentor whom she must free herself from. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally offers her the desired opportunity. And you don't have to ask her twice: at the first meeting she gives him the feeling of being physically desired, and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance. <br /> <br /> Development partnership must abide by the strict rules developed by Giovanna. Gino's lust for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave his place with Giovanna and start a new life away from the fatal is set aside. Giovanna points to another goal: to have Bragana killed, inherit and, in addition to that, collect the insurance premium. In his hands Gino degenerates into a sacrificial instrument. Being completely at the mercy of this woman, she turns into a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanna, it calls into question the crime committed on a moral level. Bragana's own stance, which includes sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a profound hatred of himself. And later, after discovering the imminent payment of the insurance money and he seems to see through Giovanna's cunning plan, he also performs a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <If Visconti's film ended at this point, it could easily be classified as a condemnation portrait of a cold, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then the latest sequences bring down this carefully constructed construct of ideas. At the end Giovanna feels full of remorse for what she has done and, thanks to the uncompromising revelation of her most intimate feelings, manages to inflame Gino's love again. His violent death due to an absurd road accident not only leaves him defenseless at the mercy of an arbitrary destiny. It also affects us, as we realize that none of the acting characters have to be made responsible for their disaster. The culprit is only the state of a society that determines the way of the unalterable individual from the beginning. <br /> <br />
