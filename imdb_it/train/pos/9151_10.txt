Savage Island's savage ferocity will scare you to death! Trust me. <br /> <br /> When the boy from the wild family is struck by some tourists from the city, Pa Savage wants revenge and will stop at nothing until he has it. <br /> <br /> This is a real horror movie with some really wonderful horror moments. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the negative review clearly comes from someone who does not have adequate knowledge of the film. The directors have chosen lighting and camera work to reflect the dark, turbid and selfish mood of the story; in other words, to get a certain aesthetic. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film has won several horror film awards.
