I'm really getting old, I'm watching this 40-year-old movie and I wonder what my grandchildren will be seeing for the last 40 years, it's an old saying, but they don't do it like this anymore ... it's not just the story, it's the music, acting both young and old ... the cast, it would seem, were born to play their roles, the young oliver, the old Fagin ... too many to mention them all, the role played by the judge oliver stands, I saw in other roles over the years ... the cunning henchman, lunatic Ron as Fagin, Mr and Mrs bumble, the film not only won 5 Oscars, but also won some golden globe awards ... if you decide to watch this movie ... do yourself a favor, take someone if not all the children, to see this masterpiece
