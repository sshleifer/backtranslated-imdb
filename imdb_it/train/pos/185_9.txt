In the end I bought and added a copy of "Show People" to my collection. I cannot comment more than what the previous spectators have said and the characters, the plot and the general quality of this film without repeating their own words. Seeing the cameo, the out-of-character appearances of so many silent stars M-G-M deserves the vision itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and meets alone playing the main character in the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read his lips because there is no title card indicating what he is saying when he sees Marion Davies but it is something with the effect of "I don't think I like it!" Whisk the wheat, pop in the ribbon and get ready to go back over three-quarters of a century in the history of cinema. To enjoy!
