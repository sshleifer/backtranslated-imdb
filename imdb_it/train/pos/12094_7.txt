Castle of Blood is a good example of quality work in the horror genre that was shot in Italy in the 1960s. The film has all the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most movies worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a haunted castle. People visited, but nobody came back. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. It is the night of every year when the dead return to relive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I see in the film is the execution time. It looks almost stuffed. There is a large portion of the first act where nothing literally happens. Our hero stumbles in the dark finding nothing interesting. But once you find something, the film resumes and becomes quite fun. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
