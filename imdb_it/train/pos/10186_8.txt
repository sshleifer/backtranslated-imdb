Ok, I know that this project does not make India in a good light. But the general theme of the film is not India, it is Shakti. The power of a warlord and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and her son swallows you in their warmth. Then things go terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and his father-in-law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a simple cameo with respect to the believable desperation of Karisma Kapoor. It's easy to get caught up in the love, violence and redemption of lives in this film, and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the height. Musical interludes are strengths, credible and well made.
