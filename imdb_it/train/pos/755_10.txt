Dirty Sanchez is the most extreme English version of Jackass in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) do everything to hurt themselves and humiliate each other. The reason this show is better than Jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned, which makes the reaction much more fun. There are 3 series of the show, the first follows them and takes a long look at their lives eg. there is an episode about their love lives, jobs, etc. The second series sends the boys to try different professions. The third follows their European tour. It seems that the boys become more and more daring as the show progresses through the series. In my opinion the third series is the best, but believe me when I say that if you have a week of stomach DO NOT WATCH, since you are slightly to see a good amount of blood and vomit in each episode.
