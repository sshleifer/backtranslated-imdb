Damn, it was very interesting. I was very enchanted all the time. It was pretty perfect, although I would say that the editing had a lot to do with it. I can't believe this guy was on good terms with all of them (Anton in particular) to get all this footage without any serious ... beef. The Dandy's came out well together, middle-class children who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, who was perhaps not what many other people felt. Great piece of film and great choice of subjects. I recommend it to any music / movie enthusiast. You will probably learn something about making movies.
