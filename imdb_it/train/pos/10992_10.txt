Damn, I've seen this movie for at least 4 times and I'm still not bored watching it. <br /> <br /> The images are so good and together with the music that is absolutely fantastic and perfect this film is amazing for me. <br /> <br /> CGIs are pretty bad IMHO, but the whole graphics with the black and white feel and totally sterile interiors were just ... Just a perfect combination genius for a movie like that. The whole feeling of feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, even if the film had few defects, such as eg sometimes I thought the film was a bit too "slow", but I don't mean the scenic parts of it, I totally loved them. <br /> <br /> I was also very often distracted by the totally complex story, like when it's in an underground area similar to a digicorps bunker, where all their data is saved, and has this conversation with the guy over there ... but it could also be myself: DE the end could have been shown somehow more emphasized, they should have made the recovery part-real-memory-a little longer and "stronger" but then again without all these defects the film would have been so beautiful that I would never have stopped watching it again and again ...
