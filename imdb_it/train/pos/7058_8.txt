Immediately after seeing the film, the true magical feeling of Walt Disney's films came into me and I realized that it was so long ago that I saw the "real" magic in a movie. <br /> <br /> The combination of the right music, speeches and magical effects brings the Disney feeling back into your body. Very special things that I saw where the non-conscious effects of the film began with the Disney logo that turned into Cinderella's castle and ended up as an ancient tale with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic is back in me. I consider this film 8 out of 10.
