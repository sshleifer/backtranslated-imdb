A great effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising given that there seems to be some resurgence in the Australian quality drama. would I dare to compare this show with the splendor of love in my own way? no. but remember the initial secret life of us. the cast is fantastic, the gibney does its magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the English cast is also strong especially in the callum and lizzie characters. but if it is possible to get another season, it can be the saving light (not that it needs to be saved). I was not a fan of his performance in the fantastic time marking miniseries a few years ago, but he was as good as ever greener. it's also nice to see Brooke Satchwell again. lets hope that the show continues to improve with each episode.
