Bar some of the questionable acting (there musicians at the end of the day), this in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is "The best rock film ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, but without rapping - a young musician, trying to put himself to the test with the local community, while fighting to face a destroyed house and a rival band. Throw sexual interest and truly exceptional performance, this is the real mile 8. <br /> <br /> Prince offers a solid performance, as do Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good direction, great plot and spectacular shows. Not forgetting some of the best rock / pop / funk songs you've ever heard.
