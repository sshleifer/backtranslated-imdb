Elegantly direct, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly performed ?? Does Crosby's performance seem right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is ​​a pleasure too? the appeal of this Yankee is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> One of the main joys of the film, of course, is the songs. As one might expect, Bing has a beautiful voice. And even though Hardwicke's solo was cut, we can still hear him singing heartily as he dances happily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty issue, "Busy Doing Nothing". It is also a pleasure to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she has enjoyed a long theater and concert career as a singer, has rarely had the chance to be heard at the cinema. Does he have a beautiful voice that more than matches his enchanting looks? and it looks really exciting in her costumes Mary Kay Dodson. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his rich budget, using all the resources at his command to present each fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse seems a little too invented, but who complains?) <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer actually describes, a delight for entertainment from beginning to end.
