I liked this movie, maybe because I didn't see any reviews, etc. It was delicious and a little "romp". I don't know why he didn't sketch more than he did. As for the story, I could refer to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character and I could "see my father" in the character of Falk. It reminded me of many pasts when I was a child and I also listened to my grandparents. If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. A "sleeper", in my opinion, is one of those wellness stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser have had many wonderful verbal fights, yet nothing has been exaggerated. I would say that they are worth at least an 8, perhaps higher.
