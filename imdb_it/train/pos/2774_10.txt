For me, movies and acting are made to tell a story. The story of David and Beth-Sheva is a tragedy that is profound and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical story. In this film I thought that the narrative of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was at their best. To know and understand David's story and his journey to become the king of Israel, he made this story even more compelling. You could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who was bigger than life at the time. The fear, the reluctance of Susan Hayward, but then obedience to her authority as her King was beautifully represented by her. You could also hear David's anguish the night Uria spent the night at the gate instead of at home. As well as sadness when he was killed in battle. The powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king by Raymond Massey made me feel his anger. The sets were quite real and the atmosphere credible. All in all I think this was one of the best films of its kind. I gave a rating of ten.
