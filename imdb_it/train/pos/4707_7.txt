"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit and miss comedy that has its laughter and "eh?". But I suggest giving him a chance. I think it's much more watched. Not too many people give this film a chance. It works. Think of it as a small parody of "Those Good Guys". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And it does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He just got up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife. And of course, like many of the mob movies, someone wants him dead. 90% of jokes get a laugh. Like, I said give it a chance. Grab your favorite gangster movies and mix a comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
