I admit to being a vampire fanatic: I saw so many vampire movies that I lost count and this is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with John Carpenter's original Vampire and when I found out that there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it. This film does not obey almost the same rules as the first, and it is not so obscure, but it is close enough and I felt that it was built well on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was nice and at the same time hard enough to make the viewer believe that he would actually be able to survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite parts was only after he met Zoey and wandered into the restaurant bathroom to check if it was more than it looks. His comments are wonderfully irreverent and yet eminently practical that contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> The other cast members were well chosen and worked well to produce a fun and original film. It is not simply a rehash of the first film and has grown in a similar way to the way in which Fright Night II originated from Fright Night. There are several elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend this. If you prefer your less bloody films, then choose something else.
