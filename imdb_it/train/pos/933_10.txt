I saw this movie in the sixth grade at Christmas time, and I was really excited to see it, and when I heard George C. Scott was there, I was really excited, because I love George C. Scott! When my class and I were watching this movie, I thought about it a lot, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was absolutely fabulous! This is the best version of the Charles Dickens classic novel I've seen so far! George C. Scott's interpretation as Scrooge is something else, I thought it was the perfect choice, it was Scrooge, it's the real Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is the one with Patrick Stewart, but this one is the best! <br /> <br /> What is really great about this is acting, I thought the actors were fabulous, everyone was, the spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, couldn't find anyone better than them they had made the parts! But the best part of the film was George C. Scott! When I saw it, I thought it was the best ever! It's the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I don't think they could have found someone better! I don't think they could have found someone better to replace someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This film is probably the definitive film adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, and I really think you'll agree, you'll think this movie is fabulous! I'll probably have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was absolutely fabulous! I highly recommend seeing this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
