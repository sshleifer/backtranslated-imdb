hi, I scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on t.v as I think she's fine. I'm a true Sabrina fan even the teenage witch, so this helped me to see it (don't ask). I like the way Nicole plans her parents by killing them very carefully, while making sure someone else pulls the trigger and exercises the bottles, so she won't give her her fingerprints (a well-planned idea), again I guess it all turned back against Nicole when she was surprised while her old boyfriend arrives and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this film a nine out of ten and I put it in my top 10 movies. And last but not least, if anyone sees this film in stores, please tell me how I saw it on TV and I didn't record it. goodbye
