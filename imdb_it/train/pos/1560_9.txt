This is a meeting, a team and a great episode of justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark made a major leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny, to a Superman who, like Freccia Verde, sets his emotions aside for his loved ones, ready to save the entire planet . This is not just an electrifying story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; it's also about deciding what's most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I don't want the series to end, but I hope the episodes that follow will stay true to what Justice shows without "rewind" shoving and put an end to Smallville here --- and a wonderful start to Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and the Team. Nine stars should give you enough credit.
