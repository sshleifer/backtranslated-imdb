This film Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain contains very little thought or effort. He is ridiculed with the characteristics of a super-fast slasher-style death and simple disgusting acts of death. The acting was rated as a D because the actors show very few skills, and their stupidity in the film is too questionable. The way they portrayed what people of their age behaved was incredibly different. The strange splitting of porn is in tune with the thought that in reality it doesn't offer much, and any area that is respectable, but is fairly quickly filled with absolute death. Example is the poor boy who is gutted by his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes. It is terribly obvious how little of a struggle the boys have made. This film is a good choice for someone who likes to witness terrible deaths and practically torture.
