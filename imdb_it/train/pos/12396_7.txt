This is the second part of "The Animatrix", a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the world of "The Matrix". <br /> <br /> In this we learn how men and machines may not work and live together. It's a little history lesson in the world of "The Matrix". Not as good as the first part ('The Final Flight of the Osiris'), but still quite fun.
