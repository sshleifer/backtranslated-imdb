This was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of my brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family. Well acted and well directed. If there were any flaws, I should say that the story showed again the typical suburban family and their difficulties. What about all the people of every cultural background? I'd like to see a movie where all these cultures are shown, like in real life. However, the film has grown in terms of values ​​and understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to its creator. I loved the movie and it brought tears to my eyes
