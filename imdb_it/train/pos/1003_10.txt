Another Australian masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and does it very well. He does not resort to great special effects like American films, but focuses more on the emotional impact. A relatively simple storyline that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. Following is the story of a couple who buy an old house that was to be inhabited by a very old woman who never came out and whose husband disappeared under mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things start happening at home, and John Adam begins to turn into the missing man, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
