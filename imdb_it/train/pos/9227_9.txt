Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> spoiler warning! <br /> <br /> This underrated gem of a film tells the story of Flavia, a 15th-century noble girl walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole medieval Christian society by observing a fallen Islamic warrior as human figure rather than demonic. <br /> <br /> Unable to accept the patriarchal domain of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene in which the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to question herself explicitly about the society in which she finds herself and, through the struggle against an entire system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to itself but to all those around her. <br /> <br /> Announced as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth. This is a cinematographic representation of the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I described it in the title of this piece as "post-feminist" "and in the end Flavia's triumphs must always be corrupt, compromised and perverted by men. Even Flavia's macabre end is perpetrated from men to men (women turn and only the monks look without horror. <br /> <br /> As for the much-discussed violence: this is a representation of the effects of violence and horrors of a world gone mad from excess religious: having removed the violence would have limited the impact of the film, would have made the film cheaper and allowed to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse that it is exposing. It is also a realistic portrait of medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, brilliantly performed (in particular by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), containing a splendid soundtrack of rain and still challenging after all these years Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
