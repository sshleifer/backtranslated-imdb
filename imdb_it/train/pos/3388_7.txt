New York, 2022: greenhouse effect, disappeared oceans, grinding of unemployment and scarcity of water, energy and food .. and the population of New York has exceeded 40 million. This is a small jewel of image, not least because a future impoverished by resources is a reality for us citizens of the XXI century. <br /> <br /> The low-budget opening titles of this film are fantastic: the music, a sequence of "low-tech" subtitles composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography until 1973, depicts a pastoral pristine American that is developing into polluted and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes. Succinct and unambiguous, it is truly memorable. The limits of the budget are also the basis of a rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, in contrast to the brilliant premise of the story. The police station sequences are like an episode of a TV show on the TV in the 70s, and the other interiors seem essential at best. Probably the budget has continued to try to "make futuristic" the "Chelsea West" apartment of Soylent Executive with avant-garde gems, which means that the other costumes are superficial, some shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exterior looks like a smoke filter. . <br /> <br /> The memorable scene in which Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare foods perfectly sums up their society: they enjoy true bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple and beef and we feel really their open-mouthed appreciation of someone else's rich privileges. <br /> <br /> The crucial scene of Robinson's death, in which his character is voluntarily and instead in a place called "Home", describes him immersed in images of the once beautiful flora and fauna in the world, as he reminded her, beautifully at odds with Thorn's gripping awareness that the future has been bankrupt, among other horrors. <br /> <br /> This is an intelligent film and its main message is as relevant today as it was in the early 1970s. Yes, I know we are not eating the dead yet, but with our resource-consuming longevity, the spiral of poverty, global corporate capitalism and the uncontrolled destruction of habitats leading to climate change, the lasting prediction of "Soylent Green" could come true.
