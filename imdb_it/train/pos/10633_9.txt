This film is as unique as it is neglected ...... A different story is just that, it shows how to survive or maintain, you can find the ability to love if you have an open heart and an open mind. I saw it for the first time on cable in the late 1970s and at that moment it really represented the limits of the gay community. I believe this film was ahead of its time in depicting a small slice of an obscure way of life. It is truly a classic, in the sense that it was a forerunner of what is now represented as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be recognized, but show how far we've come and we still have to go where the relationships are.
