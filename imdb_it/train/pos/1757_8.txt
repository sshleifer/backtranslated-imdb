The key to The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not just that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but rather the way Steve Carell presents him as one. In a genre of coarse "comedy" that has been characterized by its lack of humor and engaging characters, The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the ass of cruel jokes . That Andy is still a virgin at forty is not so much a joke, in fact, since it is a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, a veteran of Anchorman's Ferrell Team and a former Daily Show actor, uses the concept of the film to expand his character ?? we understand why Andy is as it is. It's the little things that make this movie work. When Andy's collaborator in an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his failed cooking attempts. When Andy rides his bicycle to work, he signals his shifts. Does he not only decorate his house with action figures ?? he paints them and talks to them, and reveals that some of the really old ones belonged to him since childhood. A minor comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> Is the plot pretty simplistic ?? Andy's workmates find that he never had sex and do a personal search to put him to bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film doesn't try to hide its youth. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend over two years ago, but is still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a female ladies for women and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts to bring Andy back into the bag many times, and each time leaves Andy less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Andy finally meets his single mother Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and, to the great regret of his worried friends who say that mothers are not worth it, falls in love with her. They start a relationship and agree to suspend sex for twenty days ?? Trish is not aware that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and began the short-lived cult TV show Maniacs and misfits. Is Apatow renowned for its unique sense of humor and script? co-written by Carell ?? offers a lot. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the most interesting and (truly surprising) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity. By now you're probably well aware that the film has received rave reviews from critics, and I was also surprised by its warm welcome. But after seeing the movie, it's easy to see why. We like Andy. We take care of him. Isn't it just a clich√© of cardboard-cut sexual comedy ?? he is a real, living, breathing person. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with a childlike naivety. His friends are not unpleasant jerks and his love affair is tumultuous and bittersweet. It affects the public. <br /> <br /> Although this is far from being a perfect film and certainly contains some rather crude insinuations and sexual humor, it does not offend to the extent that other genre voices could have because we have affection for people on the screen . The best sexual comedies work this way ?? from risky business to American pie ?? and this is the main difference between something like 40 years virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
