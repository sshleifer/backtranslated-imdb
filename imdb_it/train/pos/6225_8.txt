This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and that has the highest score and is quite unusual as two of the numbers are played by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divided and / or shared between the main. As usual the plot does not need to hold her back, because for the record it was based on a theatrical work, Shore Leave, which also served as the basis for a Broadway musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who has seen Shore Leave in the theater may have been momentarily stunned as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the film, but what matters, as always, is the music, the lyrics and the hoof and that's all out right hand bottle. It's a departure from the other titles in the series in this 1) we see Astaire playing the piano - in real life he was an experienced pianist and composed several songs, one of which, I'm building up to a terrible let-Down, had a text by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks on the charts - and is the only one in the series in which he plays a military man, although an ex-hoofer who joined the navy after being dumped by his dance partner Ginger before the story begins. Arrives to perform in a little-known but excellent Berlin issue, I'd rather lead a band and sing with I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket, but the maximum is the prophetic - in 1936 the rumbles of the Second World War were already have been heard - Let's Face The Music And Dance, one of the most powerful ballads ever performed by the team. What if Randolph Scott were a bit of wood and fish out of the water without a horse or a six-shot gun on hand and Harriet Hilliard doesn't exactly burn the screen; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, they deliver. Answer: A spade.
