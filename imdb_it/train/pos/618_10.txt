This film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was "enchanted", I should say, and surprised by the way it was uniquely made. Cast, sequencing, effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made him exceptional from the rest is that he was told in a fun and healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me it is the representation of the modern fairy tale. It's like the modern peter pan ... just awesome <br /> <br /> I would definitely buy a copy of this when it hit the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double MUST SEE one ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
