Yes, as other reviewers have already stated, this may not be vintage L & H but it is far from being their worst job as 20th Century Stupid ... I mean Fox. This film certainly has all the basic ingredients that make things bad for kids. But it is their serious approach and their determination that makes them fun. They don't play it to laugh like other comedians might, but they take their work and their situation seriously and this is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are faced with some basic questions that could really be encountered by some of us today, namely work-related stress. First, we would check out a doctor and he would prescribe some necessary rest and maybe stay close to the sea. This is where the surreal comes to all this. L & H always takes a series of plausible and exaggerated circumstances but never to the point of being incredible, except maybe once in a while. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their self-caused situations and external attempts. This is what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film all these ingredients are presented in a delicious and graciously slapstick way. It's not the best compared to their previous work, probably because this was the last film they made for Roach because he wanted to mirror the "big" studios and devote himself exclusively to the creation of features and he also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligations. BIG MISTAKE! They should all be together and continue for maybe another five years. What the world may have lost in their not considering this option as an option. Look, laugh and have fun as a last great performance.
