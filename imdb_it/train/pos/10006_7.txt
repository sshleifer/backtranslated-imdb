In this "critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on real events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a famous writer and late-night talk show host, is fascinated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). questions arise about the story of this boy, however, Gabriel finds himself involved in a mystery that hides a deadly secret "according to the official synopsis of the film. <br /> <br /> You really should stop reading these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> "How did he lose his leg?" In the end, with Mrs. Collette who is planning her new life, it should be cut and sent to the "deleted scenes" lands. It's excessive. The true nature of his physical and mental disorders should be obvious when Mr. Williams returns to New York. Perhaps, his blindness could be questioned, but a revelation could be made secure in the "highway" or "videotape" scenes. The film would benefit from a new montage: how about a "director's cut"? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (like Jess) do not initially seem credible as a couple. A scene or two that establish their relationship may have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a "gay representation". Sandra Oh (like Anna), Joe Morton (like Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. Best of all, "Donna" by Collette belongs to the frightening Hall of Fame. Ms. Oh is right in saying that Collette could be, "you know, like that" Psycho "guy." There have been several years in which the organizations that gave awards for acting seemed to reach women, due to less dispersion of roles; sure, they could have noticed Collette with some consideration of the prize. She is so good. And director Patrick Stettner certainly conjures up Hitchcock - he even gets a sandwich from a suspense vending machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere. > <br /> ******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
