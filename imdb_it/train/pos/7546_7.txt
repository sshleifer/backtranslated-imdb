CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" type kittens that embark on a bizarre journey across the afterlife, where anything can happen, and it does. This Asian short that attracts the mind does not use dialogues, instead replacing the word balloons. There is no way to describe this demented comic if not to tell you to see it alone. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. The dismemberment and the cannibalism and the cruelty and the ferocity and the sudden death and the cruel contempt for the others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant made up of water that kittens swim through and in, and even ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that unusual, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.
