A surprising rent in a local video store, I was pleased to find a media satire worthy of being tested with "Natural Born Killers" by Oliver Stone. And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my vision of being at the end of 2004 watching the Republican machine do its magic on most of the populated American television vision. It raises the question "Are we really so manipulative?" <br /> <br /> It has definitely distorted my point of view. There was also a wider theological question that was provoked: the story of Christ. Could the word of mouth and the overwhelming dependence on something exploited like television produce a messiah? Could the story of Christ have been exaggerated? Could it have been completely manufactured? It is something that the film puts in an extremely perceptive light.
