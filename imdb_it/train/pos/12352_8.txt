My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this movie. The viewer is swept away by modern life in old Japan, while at the same time being exposed to very current themes. The characters are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable ending and history, which is very refreshing. The plot is composed of mini-plots in the lives of different geisha living together in a poor neighborhood of the city. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
