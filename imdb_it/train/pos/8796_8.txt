<br /> <br /> Everything is relative seems to be the main theme since the beginning of this set of eleven pieces from eleven directors. This means that what may be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company, may not be the case for many other people, ordinary people. From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress his little students the most important thing that happened, with the result that the children are not impressed, since the death of a neighbor and such things obviously affect them much more up close, whatever may have happened in New York, in the United States, wherever it is, this series of almost documentary pieces states that not all things are the same as all men as some world leaders would try to prophesy. <br /> <br /> Considering that, obviously, the attack on the WTC was a vile event from a point of view, one gets the impression that both politicians and television cameramen tend to blow things up so disproportionate - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same international reaction have occurred if the attack had been done on Lagos, for example, or on Djakarta, for example, or even on Rio de Janeiro, for example? But I think not. The news seems to suffer from distortions depending on where things happen: much more time than TV is given to an earthquake in Italy, for example, than once ten times more destructive in Outerina Mongolia, for example. The greater distances seem to diminish the extent of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This eleven piece series helps to put things in a better perspective - or, maybe I should say, some of the pieces do, since every director with complete freedom has invented his own story, his own translated perspective, such that it is not possible to judge the entire merit, but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /> <br /> In no way should it be inferred that this is an anti-American film: it would be too simple a reading of the different messages manifested through the segments. However, he is not even pro-American. The eleven segments adopt different attitudes and the common connection, if there is one, is that the WTC attack disaster must be seen in perspective from different points of view. Only then will people like George Bush begin to understand the planet they are living on. <br /> <br /> Clearly stated in one segment is my belief that I have had for two years: America has not learned its lesson. And the lesson is that the United States must share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it with ruthless economic persuasion or simply by force. Instead of learning that the United States cannot continue to beat everyone and everywhere, its political leaders, helped and helped by Blair (and even Aznar), have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, which is not doing anyone any good in Afghanistan or Iraq at the moment, let alone much elsewhere. The mentality of the White House is totally deniable: the United States and the United Kingdom have invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos, and therefore should clear up the chaos they have caused - do not insist on the United Nations and other nations to dig with one hand and thus find an easy way out of the chaos. <br /> <br /> The radical positions adopted by the United States (or even by Israel) will be satisfied only by radical positions of the Islamic people, which for years have been preparing for fanatical fundamentalism, if only to hide their macho futility , that is stoning women to death or simply wrapping them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of some rich countries that seem intent on not seeing or understanding anything from multiple multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this lugubrious and stupid posture.
