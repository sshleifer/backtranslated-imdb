What don't you like about this movie? Every year you know you will get one or two tide movies during the Christmas season and many of them will be terrible. This film is definitely a new idea that has been taken up quite well. A very fun way for a rich young man who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the advantage of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A normal family gets six figures and a rich boy can experience Christmas as he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to manage and it was a blast to see the family reluctantly conforming to his absurd requests. It was a fun and entertaining film.
