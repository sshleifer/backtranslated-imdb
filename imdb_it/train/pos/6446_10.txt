"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I saw in my life. Who did not win the Oscar, I will not shed tears. This film is in a sort of class of its own, that an Oscar win would probably have diminished !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you made the real magnificence with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation and all those who have contributed, all of you have given a gift of love to our world. Among the points of entry into this world of ours, then going out - you can really say that you did it better! A special personal thanks from my soul to all of you who have brought back some precious memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and presentness Beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to you all. With love and light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
