When Tsui Hark experiments, nothing and no one can resist him. The legend of Zu is probably 6 hours condensed in 1 hour and 40 minutes. You don't understand everything but, as in "2001 A Space Odyssey", it's not necessary, but you can feel the power of the film every second, every image. An extraordinary vision of the future of the seventh art and the most pioneering, stunning, exultant in recent years. VITAL severe MASTERPIECE! It is absolutely perfect as it is. <br /> <br /> When Tsui Hark experiments, nothing and no one can resist him. The legend of Zu is probably 6 hours condensed in 1 hour and 40 minutes.
