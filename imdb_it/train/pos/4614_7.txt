This film is ridiculous! This is exactly what I like about this piece of "Guilty Pleasure". It's easy to condemn this film for not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had grown too big for their parts! Time does it to young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who re-appreciated her role as Lili, was pushing the Big 6-0 (although she still looked good and was still the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> Too bad that Yvonne has not been given a bigger part in De Carlo. However, it was nice to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! During the 2 seasons that THE MUNSTERS was in prime time, it was Gwynne / Lewis's chemistry that made the series such a success. The rest of the cast supported the cast members, not to mention they weren't necessary. They were! The TV series would not have survived until it did without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice on Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not up to the original TV series, it is still well calibrated and is one of the best television reunuin specials that plagued the breast tube during the late 1970s early 80s. <br /> <br />
