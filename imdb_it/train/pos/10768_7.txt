I saw this century ago when I was younger and I could never remember the title until one day I was browsing John Candy's titles on IMDb and I noticed a voice called "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something rang a bell and I clicked on it, and after reading the plot summary it brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I found out that he aged quite well despite not being a "big" comedy. It is, however, rather amusing and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of wrong identity and chills all over the world. <br /> <br /> The film has a cast of characters, including an American couple who find a woman's dog while on vacation in Europe and I decide to give it back for a reward - only to find his body at arrival. From there the plot becomes more insane and more silent and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers. <br /> <br /> Type of mix between "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and a lighter Hitchcock feature, this one was directed by Eugene Levy and managed to get some of his good friends, like John Candy . The film is mostly engaging for its cast, and the ending has a fun touch that isn't entirely unpredictable, but it's also a bit unexpected.
