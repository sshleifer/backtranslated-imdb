I grew up watching Scooby and I was a fan forever. This cartoon moves away from the usual routine that can become boring for viewers. The routine of Crooks in Mask ages and this comic is a change from this. It's not meant to replace Scooby's gang, it's just a break from the usual crime scene for both viewers and writers, I'm sure. The cartoon's focus is on Scooby and Shaggy who inherit a large sum of money and use that money to thwart plans to conquer the world by a mad scientist and his henchmen. Small gifts from the band and the same band are present from time to time. If you are a Scooby-Doo fan you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come from it. Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so that this is not the last Scooby comic.
