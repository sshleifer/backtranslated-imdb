This is a visually stunning film. The images of the Mexican desert, the ancient villa, the characters in their picturesque costumes ... are all works of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little loose, but because it is not meant to be realistic. It is taken from a book called Hundred Years of Solitude, and should be an evocation of the isolated and otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States". The terrible debt that Erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of the burden of the Latin American international debt, although there are many layers of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate a slow-moving and richly textured film, this is for you.
