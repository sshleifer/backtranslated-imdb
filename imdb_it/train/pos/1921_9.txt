ABC did more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this show. In the beginning, the show was watchable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. The loss of John shocked the world. Katey and the three children are really a solid professional cast. The lesson of an hour after John's death in real life hit me at home. I lost my father at 17 and I could sympathize and understand their pain and torment. ABC should be proud to keep this show and even preserve it as John's last wish. This show has matured and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They should be awarded Emmy.
