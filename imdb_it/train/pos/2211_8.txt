I don't watch much TV, except The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup. I think I keep this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the pungent review of pop culture that this show offers. Soup also helps me keep up with what people in the office refer to when we talk about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (come on, most people are fond of watching American Idol at because of the strange show that the auditions are), which is why most people say they look. And that means that I don't have to suffer for the other 98% of these "reality" talk shows or shows, for a nugget of "funny" or "shock". The only reason why Soup doesn't get a 10 in my opinion is that sometimes the sketches are not so funny, and on an occasion even more rare, the comment is not always up to par. But they can't all be home runs, if that were the case, Soup wouldn't be on E!. <br /> <br /> Joel's witty spirit and Soup's script team (which includes McHale) make a great show. I happen to enjoy the laughter and the comments of the crew that are out of range. Even when they are overtly obvious giving occasional courtesy laughter, it's hilarious because it's forced. Obviously they are ironic. And that's part of what makes this show fun.
