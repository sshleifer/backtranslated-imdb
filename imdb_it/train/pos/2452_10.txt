It's a good show, and I find it fun. Finally the bad types of Latin stereos are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show and I just started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of a Latin family TV show really struck me. I'm surprised the Latins finally have a good chance of being on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, it's fun, moving, touchy and beautiful.
