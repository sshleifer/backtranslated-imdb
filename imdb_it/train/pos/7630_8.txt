Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked the REAL Elvis in It Happened at the World's Fair, will probably never pass his performance as a King in this biographical movie led by Slash and shock meister Carpenter. There are times when you feel that you are watching Elvis until something brings you back to reality ... perhaps you remember an unfortunate Don Johnson of Elvis and the Queen of Beauty? All the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nervousness and hysteria to her performance as Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt Bing's dad is here playing Elvis's father, Vernon, and a beautiful and underrated performance of Robert Gray as Elvis's friend and Red West bodyguard. <br /> <br /> To see for rock and roll fans.
