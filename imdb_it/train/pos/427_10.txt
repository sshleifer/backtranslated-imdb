one of the best acting movies I've ever seen. There isn't much to the plot, but the acting is incredible. You see the characters change so subtly, the influence of the rented villa in Italy and love. And happiness. The film casts a hypnotic spell on you, just like the villa does on all women. Really "enchanted".
