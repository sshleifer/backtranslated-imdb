DO NOT judge this production from the 2-hour version that was released on VHS in the United States, which is an incomprehensible and incomprehensible chaos. I had the pleasure of seeing the full 6 hour version available on DVD from the UK, and I was enchanted. The intentional rhythm and the growing sense of threat are hypnotic, as is the extraordinary visual and sound landscape; this is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and much more authentic than many. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was rightly celebrated for his 1968 Odyssey miniseries, and this mini series is equally powerful. Just like Bekim Fehmiu has become the best Ulysses on the screen, so Klaus Maria Brandauer could be the best screen black. Now, I hope one day to see Rossi's version of The Eneide (Eneide) which was broadcast on Italian TV in 1971. <br /> <br /> I am undecided about which version of QUO VADIS is more powerful, this or that Polish mini series since 2001; everyone has different virtues and in many ways they complement each other. Certainly, one of the two haunts the Hollywood camp with Peter Ustinov.
