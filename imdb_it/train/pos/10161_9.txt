I took a flyer to rent this movie, but I have to say that it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc. Evidence Eva Longoria Parker is at the head and head in rom / com above bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who call and act. Who did it? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to resist for projects like "Over Her Dead Body". Lake Bell is also excellent, and this is the first time I've seen it. And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really cool movie, rather than in minor movies. <br /> <br /> A film like this never gets its debts from narrow-minded males. It's too bad. As other reviewers of IMDb have noted, there is nothing wrong with this gem - no hack writing or acting. <br /> <br /> And its representation of contemporary L.A. and of California, in general, makes every scene bright, beautiful, clean and in any case exceptional. Never before has a film made L.A. so beautiful. Ah, what a little talent and a lot of care they can do for a movie. <br /> <br /> I will not divulge the plot, but as a longtime and hard atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy the supernatural theme to enjoy an excellent and carefree piece of entertainment. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also so funny. <br /> <br /> This film shows popular but otherwise banal films like "Ghost" for the mediocre and excessively sentimental crap fests we are. We already know that the public's taste leans heavily on the mediocre. Some of us save our praise for the most deserving, however. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed other neglected gems such as "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, " Chances Are "with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard," Making Mr. Right "with John Malkovich, etc., you'll like this. <br /> <br /> A first-rate job (although it is hard to believe that a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.) But even that plot device takes nothing away from the film general excellence.
