This film was a disaster at the Box Office, and the reason for this is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of this story is very good, Director did his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in the emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. The star cast simply remained okay. The music and all the songs are good, Himesh is awesome as a singer here. Don't miss this movie, it's a wonderful film and it pleases us. Abhay works best until the date. I will give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
