Franco proves, once again, to be the prince of surreal and erotic cinema. Certainly, much of his work can be considered a funny joke, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is really capable of when he lets his distorted creativity flow and gives us a film that is hypnotic and enigmatic while maintaining the erotic eroticism intrinsic in his work. Jerry Van Rooyen's stunning score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre setting to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or might really (as a mysterious character claims) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world in which he lives. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anyone who also has a passing interest in alternative cinema.
