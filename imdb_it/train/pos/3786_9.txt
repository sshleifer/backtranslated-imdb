Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to the screening of a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotáři (Loners, 2000) and it was quite nice. <br /> <br /> Much like in many other Czech films, the seven central characters seem to have a rather difficult, dirty life; the web indicates that this theme was popular among US films in the early 1990s. Their relationships are melting, combining and recombining. Another typical feature of Czech films is that none of the characters is designed to be universally negative and neither is a permanently positive character. Furthermore, you can see how the characters judge the characteristics of others according to the context; this is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a young talented and married surgeon who has two daughters. However, we learn that he only studied neurobiology to show how much he loved another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses as a plumber to enter Hanka's parents' house - a house that burns repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents. He decides alone - throwing a coin - to break up with Petr who works in a private radio station. Hanka does not consider the bourgeois life of her parents as a good example, but rather seems fruitless in creating a better environment. But she is a very flexible figure, regarding the type of her boyfriends. <br /> <br /> For a while, Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be quite devastated by drugs. However, friends of his band inform Jakub that he already has another girl. Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr disband, it is organized by Robert, a broker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of the ordinary Czech people to Japanese tourists. Robert - who also supplies Jakub with marijuana - is never serious about anything and usually sleeps with many different women; in the end, his mother dies in a hospital and has his own ways to deal with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (a Slavic word for "Spring") who came to Prague from Macedonia works as a bartender - and you won't learn if she came to Czechia to see her father or UFOs. It seems pretty confusing, but sometimes it helps other characters solve their problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works at the radio station and is the only one who likes his job, a job he eventually loses. He announces to his public that he broke up with Hanka - which is how Ondřej learns of the news that makes him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ondřej's wife, Lenka, is always ready to forgive and stabilize their marriage - even after Ondřej asks a magician to make him disappear so that Ondřej can try to capture Hanka again . (The magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of a major car accident - Jakub and Hanka bring the victim to the hospital and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and at end must translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or more Japanese tourists who are shooting their films during Hanka's parents dinner. <br /> <br /> The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were smaller than four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems a little unlikely that all these events will take place between seven people, but it's fun.
