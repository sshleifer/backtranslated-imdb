I was expecting something different: more passion, drama ... Yet another failed attempt at originality. I'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clich√© of "cheesiness". 15-year-old teenagers might appreciate it though. The acting was not very convincing and the common lines lacked wit. Again, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can't say that this film is a total failure, because people look at it but don't meet the expectations of the public and sunk into mediocrity. So to conclude, the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is an appreciable thing. So, I think it's worth seeing if they don't bother you
