I was puzzled as to why the damn FOX canceled the season3 even though the season2 wasn't as good as the season1, which is really excellent !!! I like it so much that I even thought of buying DVDs on Amazon (I couldn't !: _ (I'm a Chinese student and it's inconvenient for me to get an international credit card and $.) I just hope FOX can report DA some way!
