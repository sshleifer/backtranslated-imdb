My discovery of Jan Svankmajer's cinema opened my eyes to the whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the most beautiful and technically outstanding animated films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up and waters his plant. Then he goes to make a dish. But there comes the huge hand that makes the vase collapse and asks the potter to make a statue of himself. He throws his hand, but soon returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he is forced to carve a hand of stone. He sets himself up, fainting with fatigue, but eventually completes the task. <br /> <br /> In a marvelous sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings, which keep him enslaved, and he flees home again. He closes and is accidentally killed by his beloved plant when he falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern films that strive to be realistic (why?). The hand, for example, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. All the rest is clay. The strings are visible and part of the story, making it a precursor of the movie Strings. The atmosphere is disturbing: that hand that followed the little potter managed to instill in me more terror than many horror films put together. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious but avoids being totally manipulative due to its simplicity. it is a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that cannot help to win the hearts and minds of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right.
