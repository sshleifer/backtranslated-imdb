Guys and Dolls is a film that itches for a remake. It was created forty-eight years ago. His two main stars died or Â£ 409. Even if a remake, with big stars now, would have been a box office success, he wouldn't have been able to capture the magic of this version. His boundless energy cannot be recaptured, nor the pure joy that is achieved by looking at something like this: a huge, large screen, a great entertainment film. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (the last one has a 409-pound watch. the last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest gamblers in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose crap game as can often be found-to speak is for the famous city. However, when the only place he has been held in is charging $ 1,000, Detroit needs money fast. He bets Masterson $ 1,000 who can't bring missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls is nothing but unclear types that sing and dance, which usually, as it does here, add up to the fun. It's obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical: there weren't many sets and the scenes were long. If I had to complain about something, it's like the songs were irregular. Sometimes, there were two songs in a scene; other times, thirty minutes passed without one. Guys and Dolls is never boring, just a beautiful moment. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
