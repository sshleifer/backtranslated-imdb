I think this is a fantastic version, which I saw before, to help me find which version I should use and I went to Jane Eyre in 1983 and read a comment from the users' comment and then helped me get this version. I don't regret having chosen this version nor you. I have tried to look at all the other versions and no correspondence, there is nothing like the book, and TRUST ME if you are reading the book you want something that will match it. When you are looking for something real and moving after reading the book, it is difficult because you want something that matches this. I would say that God personally brought me to this version. Indicates true love for a man. I would say that God's love is greater. If there's anything better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is no one like this!
