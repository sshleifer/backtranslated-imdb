Like the Jeffersons, Good Times was one of those classic American sitcoms that was never broadcast in the UK, not to mention the fact that it came out in the 1970s - a decade when I wasn't even born. <br /> <br /> But like most fans of the show, I saw a few episodes on You Tube - and later I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is led by James and Florida - two parents trying to come to terms with each other and, despite their lack of qualifications, they encourage their children, who have their aspirations in life to satisfy them and take the risk. James was the stern but loving father, who did not dare to hesitate in the J.J, Michael and Thelma discipline - if they were to cross the line. While Florida, on the other hand, was a loving, kind and caring mother and a loving wife, although in many ways similar to James, regarding their attitude towards parenting and family values ​​from an African American perspective. <br /> <br /> The children were just as lively and fun as the parents themselves: JJ was an aspiring artist with a foolish personality and a crazy sense of humor, who often wore multicolored clothes, and whose "DY-NO -MITE "Is the slogan contagious and familiar as" Whatchoo talking "by Arnold Jackson on Willis? "from Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was the smart-alec, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while his sister Thelma has his dreams and hopes. His verbal provocations with JJ were mostly hilarious, just as he was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was very well played by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Throughout the seasons, there were a few cameo appearances, especially from Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as himself! Actually I prefer the Good Times to say, The Cosby Show, which was a 80s show because a) I preferred the Evans family over the Huxtables, both in terms of a) characterization and b) because I thought it faced serious and difficult social problems, in a way that resonated with many spectators.It was a comedy but it was also a social comment that aimed to highlight the life of the working class, the African Americans in the America of the ann the 70s. The Cosby Show attempted to satisfy the mainstream public in a "caramelized" way, as the Huxtables were interpreted as blacks who easily assimilated to an upper class US culture with which we associate whites, while the Good Times in contrast was much more "edgy" and not afraid to tackle issues like drugs and child abuse in a realistic way. Actually I discovered that while The Cosby Show can be fun to watch, at times, it lacked the little "sassiness" that the Good Times has and has become more trendy and cool. <br /> <br /> The show missed shark during the last seasons, as it continued after the character of John Amos, James died in a bizarre accident (in fact, it was known at the time that John had left Good Times forever, and so, the death of his character was written as is on the show). Without John, the show suffered and, alas, lost much of its charm. <br /> <br /> Again, for a sitcom, Good Times has ticked all the right boxes. If only they had shown it in the UK during the 1980s. As certainly, as JJ would say, "DY-NO-MITE !!" <br /> <br /> My vote: 8 and a half
