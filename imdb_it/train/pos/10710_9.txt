I really have to disagree with Guy-yardley-rees who (if he had watched the whole movie) would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish landscapes (some of the best ever filmed in Skye) and found a film with a difficult start together with a whole moving. <br /> <br /> This is not a big-budget film. Rather it is a film that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can't say how many "standard" films bore me - always push the same things polished. Seachd doesn't look like this at all. He really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. <br /> <br /> OK, so acting is not a blockbuster style. This is because the actors are apparently real people. I actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes unusually beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really bears a second vision, since there are many threads that become clearer for the second time - Overall, the combination of music and (sometimes) extraordinary images, plus an approach communal to the acting and non-normal structure, it has transformed Seachd into a real memorable film. More of these please!
