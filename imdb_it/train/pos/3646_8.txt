"The Rookie" by Walt Disney is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former picher of the minor league who made one of the most incredible comebacks in the history of sport, closing a retreat of almost 10 years and making his Major League debut in the 1999 at the age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris's childhood, which included a series of re-locations: his father was a military man. And even when his family settled permanently in crazy Texas football, Morris's passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years at the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball teacher and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was the Reagan County High School, Big Lake, Texas). He is said to have attempted a career as a baseball player but that didn't work. <br /> <br /> Morris's team is fighting and teaching them to give up their dreams. They turn the table against him, telling him he should try for a Major League team. On several occasions, when he gets close to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he launches. Morris seems unconvinced, but accepts an agreement with his players in which, if they win the district, he will try for a Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins the district and, joining its part of the agreement, Morris participates in a Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Phenomenally, he launched 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his career in the league and exceptional speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another try with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves him a difficult decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue the dream of the Major League going through the secondary series of earning little money and spending months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more distressing than during his first stint of the minor league, because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs with the Devil Rays, starts at level AA and moves quickly to level AAA, a level under Major League Baseball. But as the season shrinks, the chances of it being "recalled" become increasingly scarce. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I love this movie. There are a lot of great shows and nice characters and it's easy to really find yourself looking for Morris. Moreover, the film does a great job interpreting professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels. And above all, it teaches the timeless message of keeping you close to your dreams even when they seem far away and almost impossible to reach. <br /> <br /> However, the film has some flaws. Although generally accurate, it exaggerates and also creates some things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Furthermore, with the exception of one scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores the Christian faith of Morris. But considering the left-wing zeal of Disney, it's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, many of the exaggerations / fabrications have been made to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20-minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD contains some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth to his family he settled in Texas forever when he was 12, Morris moved 14 times. And his early minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left shoulder (pitching), making his launch of 98 mph even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's nice not only to watch "The Rookie" but to watch the DVD documentary, check the link above to the film's inaccuracies and probably also read the Morris biography , also entitled "The Rookie". I haven't read the book but I hope for one of these days. <br /> <br /> But overall, "The Rookie" is a great portrait of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10
