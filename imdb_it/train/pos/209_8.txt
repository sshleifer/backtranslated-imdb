Walter Matthau and George Burns work so well together. Willy's acidity with the amnesic Al perplexed is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willy's apartment is a gem and the final scene completes the film perfectly. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can. The timing of George Burns is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, his calm amusement with the dry answers of the desert is memorable. Watch the scene towards the end when Al and his daughter ask the Spanish guardian something and Al - priceless reaction.
