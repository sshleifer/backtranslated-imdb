I saw it on the cable in the early 1990s and I loved it. I never saw him again until he appeared on the cable recently again. I still find it a great Vietnam film. I'm not sure why it wasn't rated higher. I found everything about this compelling film. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can refer to the situations brought by Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is more touching now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this was offered more often by cable for people to see. The human tribute on our soldiers is not left on the battlefield. He is brought home for the rest of his life. And this film is one of many that brings that house in a very difficult way. Excellent movie
