When I was little, my parents showed me this movie. I loved it and watched it again and again. Even when I was in third grade, I still looked at him from time to time. Recently, I looked at it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and even though the show was not aimed at my age group (I'm in my late teens), I found it fun and educational anyway. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and gets along well with others. Some parts I found quite funny. Furthermore, this show has no bad content, so you can leave the children alone with this show and don't worry about making fun of bad tongues or anything. I would recommend it.
