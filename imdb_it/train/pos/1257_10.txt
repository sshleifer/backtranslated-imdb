I read a number of reviews on this movie and I have to say "What's wrong with you people?!?!" This was an excellent movie! I thought this film was excellent from beginning to end and the story was told very well. I am convinced that the people who did not like this film did not pay much attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes that if you are not paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge anyone who doesn't like this movie to watch it again and watch it for yourself so you can really pay attention. The story makes perfect sense to me and, as I said, it was told very well. Every scene in the film has a point and everything combines at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good at his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was as superb as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I didn't really expect great results from him, but he did a great performance. Ed Harris was the real jewel of the film. He plays a really sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is. Look at his eyes in his scenes, simply fantastic !!! Also, there's a very young Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) in one of her first roles ... it's not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes cast members or just likes thrillers. This is a great movie and should be seen. Don't listen to all the opinions of these other people, go see the movie and come to your conclusions. I hope you will see the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
