"Magic" is not a word too strong for the spell that this film weaves. You find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light ... Every film that has a civilizing effect on viewers deserves serious attention. We are seldom soaked in beauty like this. What's more, it's fun. The performances are, without exception, extraordinary, but a special mention must be made to the miraculous Miranda Richardson and the superb Josie Walker, both open as roses. <br /> <br /> Why is NOT this DVD movie? Deserves to live forever.
