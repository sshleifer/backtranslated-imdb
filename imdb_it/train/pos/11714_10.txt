So you have to see this movie, to understand the reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke is now a supporter of those with bipolar disorder; ex-labeled maniac-depression. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that nowadays people still criticize others with emotional problems or those seeking psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and this is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> In this film, the audience sees the pain and suffering that Mrs. Duke had gone through, especially as a child. Many of us could remember it from the adolescent "Patty Duke Show". He was a household name in America at the age of 15. <br /> <br /> We learn of its exploitation by Ross (well played by Howard Hesseman). While growing in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. However, let's see how she advances in her career, yet the illness gets worse. You go through periods of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone who divorces next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and her elderly mother. All these problems occurred before you received adequate therapy and medication. <br /> <br /> A recent survey published by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) found that most US adults do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also released that one in five respondents in the survey believed that people could CHECK their disease without drugs, if they wanted to. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not "pull herself up from her boots" and "heal" until she was educated to talk about her condition, and received adequate treatment. Thank you, Mrs Duke, for being a supporter of ignorance and prejudice.
