At the time, when he was a young teenager, Airwolf was a mandatory vision for a generation that wanted its "Cowboys and Indians" to possess fantastic gadgets and blows of blows. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in the skies: a similar comic technology, a central character that was essentially a loner and that echoed the concept of a man who made the difference. <br /> <br /> But in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. First, the premise of the series is built not on the desire to help those in need, but on Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as a lever to try to find his brother MIA, St John). And then there's the dark side provided by basing the series firmly in a context of the Cold War of the 1980s, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy inside. Of course, the A-Team constantly referred to Vietnam as the team's fugitive status, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the story itself. With Airwolf, intrigue was the key to the tone and direction of the show - even though it was (thoughtlessly) diluted as the series progressed. <br /> <br /> In hindsight, the Cold War setting clearly goes back to the series, many of the stories are creaky and invented, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. But that's not the point. Airwolf was a spooky fun, trying to tell interesting stories without relying exclusively on the big action sequences, and it didn't cover everything with sugar, miraculously ensuring that no one died. Sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded very well - and with a TV budget to start. <br /> <br /> For UK readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) has just begun (January 2008) daily replicas of Airwolf. Set your Sky + box for this explosion of the past - we might even get the fourth reusable, re-cast (and unfortunately vastly inferior) season, which to my knowledge was never shown before in the UK.
