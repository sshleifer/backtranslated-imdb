it's amazing that so many people I know haven't seen this little gem. everyone I participated in returned with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT FILM !! <br /> <br /> I never really cared much about Brad Pitt (although his 12 monkeys shifts and the Fight Club show improved) but his performance in this psychopathic film is unnerving, obscure and right on target. <br /> <br /> All the other actors in the film give excellent results and the slow and thoughtful rhythm of the film greatly improves the process. the sense of terror for the characters increases as they realize what is really happening. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps it from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before, the ending is a bit too long and exaggerated. but this is the only fault I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you control this film, try to get the directorial cut without literate reviews for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> vote: 9
