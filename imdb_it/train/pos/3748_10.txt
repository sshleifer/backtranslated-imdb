I've looked at it a lot of times and I'm going to buy the full functionality. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It's very different and unique and it's a lot of fun. I love independent films and this is simply fantastic. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking spatula named Edward. The order of events is a bit confusing, making this movie very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus moves up first in his life. This is a stupid movie, but of course it's still fantastic. I highly recommend watching this movie on www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's really funny. Humor may not match all tastes, but be careful anyway. It will only take 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO WATCH HAPPY SPATULA!
