This is a very old fashioned fascinating film. The locations are fantastic and the situation is one of those old Preston movies. If you want to watch a movie that does not require much more, then sit back and relax, then it is. The acting is good and I really enjoyed Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. That's exactly what happens when two people about to get married meet the one they really love at the weekend who are planning their marriages. I know ... he looks eccentric ... but he is. And that's what makes it fun to watch. Your girlfriend will hug you or leave you, but at least you'll know.
