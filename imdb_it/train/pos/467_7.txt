This film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and certainly one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is excellent as is the recitation of Turturro and Watson. Turturro certainly gives its best result to date, showing that it is worth much more than we thought. Even Watson behaves brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro) who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with several flashbacks of Luzhin's childhood. Through them, the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say, but suggest this film to anyone.
