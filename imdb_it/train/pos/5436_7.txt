For years I thought that this surprise service comedy was a product of John Ford, in particular with Victor McLaglen as one of the protagonists. He certainly has the same house humor that Ford deserves his films with. <br /> <br /> To my surprise I learned that it was George Stevens who directed it. I still refuse to believe that this film was not offered to John Ford, but it was probably out to Monument Valley to do the stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., play three Indian army sergeants who have a nice companion / friend / companion. But the old band is melting because Fairbanks is engaged to Joan Fontaine. Not if his two friends can help him, helped and favored by the Gedy Din regimental bestie played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> The Rudyard Kipling poem was the inspiration for this RKO film about barrack life in the British Raj. The comic play of the protagonists is so beautiful that it obscures the film's incredibly racist message. Not that the producers were racist, but this was the hiring of the British at that time, including our leads and Gunga Din shows it more effectively. <br /> <br /> The British took India in increments, doing business here and there with the local rulers under a weak emperor Mogol who was suppressed in the mid-19th century. They governed very little of India outright, which would have been impossible. Their rule depended on the native troops you see here. Note that soldiers cannot exceed the rank of corporal and Gunga Din has a much lower status than that. <br /> <br /> Note that the rebels are Hindus, not Muslims. There are as many varieties of that religion as there are Christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real. Of course those who are strangled may not have the same vision of them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until Congress was born, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> But whatever you do it, strangling people is not a nice thing to do and even the British had their point here. When I look at Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason the main directive was born. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant interpreted his true cockney self instead of the humble Cary we are used to seeing. Fairbanks and McLaglen behave very well with roles that fit their personalities perfectly. <br /> <br /> The best role in the film, however, is Eduard Ciannelli as the guru, the head of the cult of the stranglers. Notice the fire and the passion in his performance, he blows all the others from the screen when he is up. <br /> <br /> The favorite scene of Gunga Din is Ciannelli who exhorts his troops in the mountain temple. Notice how Stevens progressively darkens the background around Ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a macabre Halloween mask. Disturbing, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was immediately after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more British audiences began to question the underlying assumptions that justify the Raj. But this is Gandhi's theme. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great movie, fun and entertaining. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can trace how the Indian independence movement has evolved.
