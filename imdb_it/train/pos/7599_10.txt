Before Lost all that was shown on TV was predictable. You could predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost you could predict NOTHING. Everything was so surprisingly beautiful and it was really a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so beautiful. I became literally dependent on it. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. It is brilliant. The environment is bright, calm and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are a brilliant work each of them, especially those already on the island. The castaways are so dramatic but we can never foresee their death because they have much more to do and much more to say and they have secrets concerning the other castaways who die with them.
