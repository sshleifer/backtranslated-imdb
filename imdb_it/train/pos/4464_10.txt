Incredibly NO ARTISTIC COULD DO IT NOW, I THINK. The biggest and greatest musical ever made to listen to beautiful songs that are quite poetic seems perfect. I AM ITALIAN AND ADMIRED BY MUSICAL American. why can't you do something like that now? American was the best and that's why I absolutely show you my devotion to this movie. There are words to describe the perfection of this film. all of a sudden my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I fall in love easily, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the biggest without reservations. if you don't know that your eyes are not open my friends have to see them and appreciate them ... wake up!
