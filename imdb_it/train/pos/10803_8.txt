I do not understand. Not being a critic, I'm not evaluating the quality of acting, which I find credible, a good thing. My confusion lies in the content. No one else is sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justified their infidelity to the men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continuous freedom of their families and their country. Shouldn't there have been a prologue telling us if the men had done it at home and, if so, what effect their "wives" infidelity would have on them? While these women were adjusting their paramours for a sense of loneliness, did they think their husbands were having fun shooting while they faced death or dismemberment every day? They didn't think about their husbands at all! Only about yourself. Forgive me, except when they wanted their dead husbands.
