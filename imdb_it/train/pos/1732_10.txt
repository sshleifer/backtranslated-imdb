"Sandra, the Making of a Woman" is an extraordinary feat among exploitative films, and for two reasons: (1) an excellent performance, but without effort, by Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents, both very undervalued, make "Sandra" a film that should be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the film's success is its realism - there is nothing fake or "Hollywood" about this film set in California. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple clothes worn by the character, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing on her door, and Sandra sits on the sofa without makeup. while Digart tries to sell him some cosmetics, as if he had just woken up (but still beautiful), the innocuous weird Sandra gathers who loves making love with her while wearing a bra, the apartment from a room that Sandra moves - all these elements of the film seem completely real, and as such, the viewer is attracted to Sandra's small world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and comes with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This film could easily fail in less competent hands, and could have gone into any the usual indications about sex, but the Garver / Gale team makes sure that "Sandra" is not just creating a woman, but the making of an excellent film.
