I can't believe a movie that can be made so good in 1987 and is practically unknown in the West. Don't repeat other reviews here. The score is very good and moving. Literally it means "Dawn please never comes" - when it arrives, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie are still gorgeous. I liked Joel in God of Gamblers and many of Leslie's films, including Better Tomorrow.
