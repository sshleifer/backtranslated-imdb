After losing the Emmy for his portrayal of Mama Rose on the television version of GYPSY, Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live special shot for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who performed live live in the 1970s, still proves to be one of the most electrifying live performances in the business world. From her opening number, her classic "Friends", where she drops from the wings on top of a beautiful cloud of props, Bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap style number called "I Look Good", then proves to have a way with a joke like few other artists in this area as it makes its way through a variety of musical selections. The section of the show in which he greets burlesque goes on a little too long, but manages to incorporate his old lines of Sophie Tucker here to good advantage (although in reality he forgets a joke in the middle of saying it, but his announcement advertising until you remember that it is hysterical). Bette also talks about "Rose's Turn" by GYPSY and the title of her hit film THE ROSE, as well as a shameless thorn for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Lower the house towards the end with "Stay with Me, Baby" by THE ROSE and his only successful # 1 record, "Wind Beneath My Wings" by BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of comic musical entertainment and for Midler fans, it's a must.
