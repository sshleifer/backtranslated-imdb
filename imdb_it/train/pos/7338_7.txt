Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. The film is about a village destroyed by a giant glacier that is the home of the evil ice lord named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who intends to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the fiery earth and the land princess named Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn sets out to find her and decides to find and kill Nekron. Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He gave us animated masterpieces like the film version of Fritz The Cat and some films he wrote himself, like the great movie Heavy Traffic. I didn't like Fire And Ice almost as much as Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I still found the film funny. It had some very nice animations in some parts and the story was pretty funny. The only basic complaint I have is that I would like there to be more than one story for the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much to do. I would also like the film to be a little longer because it has less than 80 minutes of time. Yet it is an action and adventure film that unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic is appropriate for 8 year olds. I just hope there's a more developed story and it's gone a little longer than it was.
