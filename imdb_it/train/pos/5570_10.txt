Sophmoric this film is. But it's fun when everyone comes out. Show the "men's dressing room mentality" interpreted by the other side. It's nice to see how these tides turn and how silly they are. But it's probably not new to most women, because (just ask for one), "they've all heard them before". <br /> <br /> Watch it with a small group or a mixed gender party and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7% ... will you ever really like it?
