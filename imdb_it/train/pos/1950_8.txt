Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" parts in her many years on the big screen, but is mainly known for "light and fluffy" with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. You deserve an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it doesn't matter what the competition of the year in which it was presented for the first time. Try and find a scene where it doesn't appear. And it was all a heavy drama, exhausting in its rhythm and resumed, action, all at full speed. The make-up made her as young as possible and adapted to the category of the 1930s even in close-ups, but she played at half her age and at a very fast pace. The film, on the whole, was pretty well done, staged and shot well with a strong supporting cast, but Keaton brought the load.
