I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four stars out of four, but, apart from his, I never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three major themes stories romantic or movies have in common). <br /> <br /> The main theme here is the class division. Stella is a story of American depression. That said, it has been translated so memorably on the screen that this remake (if you ask one or two Stanwyck fans) was not exactly appreciated. Fans of the original never gave him a chance. Furthermore, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, not exactly a period of major financial problems in America (such as depression was). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove the pink-colored glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and to see that this powerful story still sounds true, is as timely as ever. relevant, in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, the class gap is the main theme here. Stella is among the poor workers, single, with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams. He works in a bar, he doesn't have much money, he lives in a poor apartment. You have the drift. In the morning, she really doesn't want to get out of bed. On his wall, photos of the movie stars she idolizes. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dancing at the bar. He is rich, polite, from one of those upper middle class families that has nothing in common with Stella. His main concern is the Edy League college to attend, his is like paying rent, being "happy". They have a relationship. They like each other. Stella ends up pregnant. Stella tells the boy the news. His answer? "How about an abortion?" She replies: "I just wanted a room full of balloons". He gives the balloons and the proposal, but he sees his heart is not in it, and he has too much pride to accept. She sends him to pack. <br /> <br /> His daughter is finally split between the two lifestyles: the love she has for her mother and the advantages, happiness and love that the rich father offers her. Stella, alone and unloved, and who does not want her daughter to become as unhappy as she is one day, makes the greatest sacrifice. He abandons the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure her daughter's happiness, and perhaps live indirectly, and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter has found something to live for. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. Everything is right about it. Beautiful soundtrack, artistic photography, great scenography (contrast between the two lifestyles, the messy apartment and decorated villas), wonderful performances and felt by the whole cast, with Bette Midler, in particular, worthy of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is a much more meaningful and well-made film than you've been led to believe.
