I love this show, but I saw the second episode before. After seeing the first episode, I could see why people had been turned off at first. The humor of the first episode is not the best and they struggle to start the series correctly. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become really funny characters. As a first episode, it really doesn't represent exactly the rest of the show which is really quite good. The episode is not bad in any way, but as the show proceeds it becomes better and better, so watch other episodes before judging the quality of the show.
