Much of the problem that many people have with this film is that they seem to think that the story should have been more fun (ignoring that it is based on a true story) or railing against a film that glorifies Che (which it really doesn't). This film is very close to the definitive biography of Jon Anderson on Che and gets the right story. Soderburgh does a great job in setting the mood for the defeat that was the Bolivian adventure of Che. You really have the impression of the total shyness and bewilderment of the Bolzano peasant towards the revolutionary ideas of Che or the difficulties his men face with hunger and soil. I'm sorry to bore the attention of the challenged fan out there, but that's how it happened. So don't go in this movie expecting a rambo shoot em, it's a true story!
