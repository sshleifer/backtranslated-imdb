I love this movie, but I can't get what is in this film that you don't have to like. People who don't like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe Mr. Carrey is behind all that trick. And I'm sure most of the actors and actresses in the film made films before this. And there's a new face in the film. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. At the opening, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And it causes some fun for whos in Whoville. We know that whos love Christmas. While The Grinch does not love Christmas. And he even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the city's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrator's voice is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is chosen as mayor of whoville. Who does not like to talk about the Grinch near Christmas.
