Best Seinfeld show. She is really very funny. Its total self-centeredness, its massive gay stoner neighbors, departures in songs or cartoons, make this show the freshest on TV. One of the few shows that I make point of observation. The scene with the old and wise black woman in the pharmacy ("oh wait now that you're close, you look old" turns face to face and leaves), the cough syrup overdose, sleeping with God, it's all so funny or so stupid is just very funny. The weaknesses of the shows are his sister and the policeman, just because they are really damn normal !! I'm really looking forward to the next show, something I've never tried for a long time.
