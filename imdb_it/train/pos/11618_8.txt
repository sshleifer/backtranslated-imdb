Rachel Mcadams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A fantastic plot. A great turning point. A great pleasure for the eyes. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest films besides "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the film and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a distressed hotel manager, hails a late eye in Los Angeles late. Little does he know that it was followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. Later he reveals that he is a murderer who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security located in Lisa's hotel. And what does it have to do with Lisa. Well, he should have moved his room to the upper suite so he could bomb it, if he doesn't, Ripner will kill his father (Brian Cox). The twist and the bringing of history really give it the extra zing and the side characters and side jokes really add it. Overall, definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 on 4 stars
