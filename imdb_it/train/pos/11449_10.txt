this was by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a type of man who is at extinction. he sees the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good sense. its purity, honesty and kindness clearly breathes as you watch it work in works of art so simple and full of life. I was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor brilliantly covers his disappointments. the film is shot elegantly and contains the same stream as Goldsworthy's art. combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. Fred Frith's soundtrack is organic enough to blend everything without interfering with his naturalistic sound. this is overall a great job in every aspect. it has no boundaries in terms of age.
