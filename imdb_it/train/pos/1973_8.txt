I never trust anyone's opinions about a movie. This also applies to critics. Of course, if you get positive reviews it's okay and a plus, but most movies that get a rave critical hate. I liked this movie for what it was, a funny movie. It takes you out of your life for a couple of hours and into a fictional character ... who is Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is exceptional in this role, just as she was in the first. Anyone who says they are horrible in this film must have experienced the same thing in the first b / c, returned to acting the same way in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays it perfectly. His one liners are fantastic, just like in the first one. Who can forget in the first film when he tells the cops: "If you want to arrest me do it ... otherwise send away the f ** k!" Great scene, and believe me, it does it again in this. I was fascinated by her. Believe me, his clothes, the way he smoked his cigarettes, are worth the price to see Stone's performance. I can't wait for the film to be released on DVD, without cuts, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are many twists, like the first one, including the finale!
