A truly adorable heroine who, in turn, is surprised and terrified by giblets, struggles with mattresses, runs behind closed doors ... just some of the moments that shine in my memory of "The Naked Truth". I really liked what I discovered of this show: pleasant plots and some good supporting characters provided the backdrop for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni as, 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clownish, and wonderfully accident-prone - How good it is to see an actress who knows how to make a clown - it's no wonder Hollyood doesn't seem to know how to launch it. But where-oh-WHERE are the DVD releases? The amount of (beeps) they release, it's amazing that this little gem continues to remain buried. (Someone, please correct me if I'm wrong.)
