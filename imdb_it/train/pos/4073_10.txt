Have you ever wanted to be able to escape your boring and stressful life at school or at work and embark on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends by your side, facing all sorts of dangers and evils and revealing the mystery of a lost civilization waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you are not so much a lover of fantasy, have you ever wanted to be able to simply try what it means to be a child again, and not have a cure in the world, just for a couple of hours? <br /> <br /> This is exactly the meaning of Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky". Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day a girl named Sheeta falls from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey away from the clouds, while all the time they have pirates and military units on their tracks. In a nutshell, it is the incredible adventure that every child dreams of in one place or another, and I can't help but feel my worries fade away whenever I see it. <br /> <br /> As one of the oldest works of Miyazaki and occupies a lot of space in the everyday world, the film is not visually spectacular or profound in its plot like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. However, I find it difficult to say that one of these films is superior to the other, because all three of these films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of the spectators. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, does not attempt to be an allegory of any kind, nor is it a growth story; it is quite probably one of the best representations of the interior of a child's mind that I have ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from children's eyes is simply fantastic; if it is the panning of the "camera" to see the huge trees or the clouds above the head, or the incredible sense of height from looking at the ground or the ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I really can't do without FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a child in another world, very far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even children do not have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, who literally fell into his life from heaven one day, the absolutely perfect person for him from the beginning. As the film progresses, more and more their adventurous spirit of childhood comes out through their kind words and wonderfully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they a lovely reminder of who I was, but their captivating friendship never lets them out throughout the film, but it gets stronger and stronger until the last frame. Because of this, I fell in love with them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual spectator you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, science fiction, romance, even a little western ... that's all, almost everything that people go to the movies (except maybe the horror). This is because I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it is perfect for those who have no expectation of having already seen the incredible world of some of his most recent works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, translated into English, conveys a sense of desire to discover a kind of lost civilization and a kind of soul mate, which could not be found in our worldly lives . "The reason I ardently desire the many lights is that you are there in one of them ... The earth turns, transporting you, bringing us both that will surely meet." Miyazaki has always provided poetic texts to end the songs of the beautiful scores of Joe Hiasashi, but this is the only one that I have seen is both a moving love song and an inspiring dream. I found myself close to tears just listening to him. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" may not be the most developed, spectacular or significant work of Miyazaki, but it is absolutely perfect for what it really should have been: a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for all adults who wish to have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree children. Sit down, relax and love for what it is.
