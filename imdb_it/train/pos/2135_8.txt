Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Dance is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of individuality. This is certainly the case with Aoki. At work it is a humble office, but puts it on the dance floor and all its intensity in the bottle is released. Surprisingly, this version is frowned upon in Japan because of the strict compliance culture. At the beginning of the film, all the characters are ashamed or fear their desire to dance. They will be indignant, or considered perverse, to express their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching this film to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. Leave a smile on your face for days.
