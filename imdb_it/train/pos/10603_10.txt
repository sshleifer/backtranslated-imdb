I get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly watching Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It seems that they are always the same old cartoons tired to rework. When my daughters couldn't go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to relax and rest for a while. I turned on the TV and looking for something different, I reversed the channels. My finger interrupted the navigation channel the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I love every single lonely thing that this man did and when I saw that he was doing the voice-over job for a little duck ... well, I couldn't change channels! My daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show TOGETHER, the more I grew up loving it together with the message that was being represented. He is not necessarily a supporter of "gay rights", but rather of anyone who has been ostracized as a child for ANYTHING. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, being a bully, not being smart enough, just having one parent ... call it! Children, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other so I was happy to see a funny cartoon that actually transmitted a LIFE MESSAGE to its audience. My girls already accept others as they are and do not choose others to be different. My eldest daughter actually fights for her friends if they are chosen (it happens to have a single mother and that little girl is often chosen - it warms my heart when Kassie defends her!). <Br /> <br /> So, those of you who condemn this show because you think it is a supporter of "gay rights" or are forced to "accept certain points of view", you have clearly and completely lost the point of small moving cardboard. <br /> <br /> And if you need it it has been explained to you ... well, you need more help than any TV program can ever offer.
