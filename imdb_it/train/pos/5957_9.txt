The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic, nor will I behave like the rest of the snobbish people who comment on this film. <br /> <br /> Obviously this film did not work I have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was fantastic and the cinematography was fantastic! It seems like everyone had a lot of fun making this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on one channel instead of both, but I guess this could have been a mistake in recording the DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other films produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
