Well, I gave this movie to 7. It was better than "Thirdspace" but not as good as "In the Beginning" for B5 movies. I really think that the television series did a much better job in general with special effects and character representation. We hope that the producers and the cast will get the next "Crusade" series according to B5 standards.
