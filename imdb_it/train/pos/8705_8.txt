Despite the title, The Sword Bearer, and the DVD cover (action / herioc poses of The Sword Bearer) this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) Following is the story of Sasha, The Sword Bearer, who is cursed with a retractable sword in his forearm. Cool you say, but no, this is real life. If you had this power as a child you could control it when, for example, in front of a crazy man, or when your mother's boyfriend is beating her. And if you don't control it, how can you be a two-year killer at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> This is essentially where we meet Sasha. Wandering aimlessly after another murder (very similar to A Bout de Souffl√©). Then he meets Katya and the couple instantly falls in love, giving Sasha a real reason to live and try and change his ways. However, his past is still pursuing him, in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on the screen, albeit much if suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood superhero films, we have a very little retrospective story, there is no villain (unless you count the same Sword Bearer) there is a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking if you can find it.
