You can survive the surviving Christmas. I thought the TV version was a bit modified. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a family, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos played by James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as their parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is alone on vacation during the holidays because he doesn't have a family for which he rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, who I remember best for playing Maude's husband, Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos family is crumbling apart from Drew's situation. Drew's rich girl and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you want! The acting and writing are mediocre but the first quality cast takes him to the final scene.
