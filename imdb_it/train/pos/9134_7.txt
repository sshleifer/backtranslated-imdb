"Purple Rain" has never been a great critic, but it is a cult classic - and it deserves to be. If you are a Prince fan, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is to see his abusive parents in himself and he fall in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this film is not just about singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is moving. Sometimes it's fun but when it works it really works. Very inconstant. <br /> <br /> No one can really act in the film. All come from one of Prince's parts, like "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Still, it adds charm to the film. When Prince is always on the screen, he turns it on and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go see this if you love Prince like me. If you're not a fan, you'll get one.
