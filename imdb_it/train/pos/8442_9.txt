The film was excellent, except for some scenes with Esposito. I liked how it brought together all the detectives in the series, and wrapped some stories that were never solved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was nice to see Pembleton and Bayliss together with their most humane and simple people. Braugher and Secor have done a great job, but as usual they will be neglected. It hurts to see that this was the end of Homicide. Memories, tapes and replicas on CourtTV are not the same as watching him come every Friday. But the film did its job and did it very well, presenting a great representation of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I loved it.
