Chris Gerolmo made sure not to simply give us a list of people murdered as "Jack-the-stripper": he investigated the psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps especially due to the excellent performance of Stephen Rea who plays against Donald Sutherland with a good empathy on the part of both. Was it the game of these two parts? mostly ?? which made the film something more than just a morbid tale of the Rostov butcher's story. The supporting actors, particularly Max von Sydow, performed their parts very well. Good direction The photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was intended to produce a couple of aberrations, but frankly, given the depth of the narratives and interpretations, we can completely forget these little trivialities. <br /> <For once, an HBO TV movie has become a hit. Recommended, especially if you like to analyze caracteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes ?? which, I hasten to add, I have never exaggerated.
