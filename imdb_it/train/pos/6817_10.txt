I love the film, it was a very interesting fantasy film b / c of the true meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the action full of fun shown in the film. I look at the time at the top of 4 X of a week and I love it! I wish a sequel had been made to see more of Susan's dad in the past and observe how Susan was upset with her new little sister and had no phone, computer, gameboys or anything from the 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the film as much as I imagined that you could say that I'm a fan time at most and I don't mind. The kid in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adorable, I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he starred in movies or TV series?
