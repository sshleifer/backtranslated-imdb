I've seen this movie many times and I have to tell you, I liked it every time. This is Belushi's best movie in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so nice and identifiable with the common man that you can't help being involved once you start looking. The film has a wonderful cast of stars, some were already large and others had just started. It's considered a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This film teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all. Sometimes you just have to look at things in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you finish watching, you will appreciate the things you have much more and you smile too. You can't ask for much more from a film in my opinion, not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest. Very very underestimated film here people. <br /> <br /> Evaluation from me: 10 I am out !!!
