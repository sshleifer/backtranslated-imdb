I have read several conflicting reviews and many of them have completely destroyed the film. Initially I became interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me. Before starting my review, I would first like to say this ... it is wonderful to see that this film could have been told in a boring and ordinary way, yet the writers and Scott have chosen a different approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies provide "tried and true" plots that know they will connect with people, often ensuring the audience's acceptance of the film and creating a greater likelihood of profit. This plot was one of the most interesting I had seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently watched "The Weather Man" and "Lord of War" and while I will say that these films are excellent, and I both enjoyed them tremendously, both the plots in these films are boring and they are told exactly how would you expect them to be told. They have no chance, and they are extremely predictable after seeing a good amount of American films. Domino's plot is both interesting and told in a way that makes you think: "oh man, I'm screwed now". And I feel that he has missed many recent films. It has a lot of depth, in my opinion, and gives you a lot of things to question while you watch it. Overall, this is what kept me so interested in the film. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I heard the characters were accurate. Knightley did a great job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but inside and wanted to be seen as what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and that she had taken any means to achieve it. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very credible, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his problems of jealousy within the team ... everyone has sounded good to me, which made me feel that his character was much more realistic. <br /> <br /> The character of Rourke was the least interesting for me, but it still sounded true to me. He seemed a normal type, trying to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what I got. He did a great job of showing Ed in an average Joe way that he made his mistakes, yet he's still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I think they provided the heart they needed so much in history. It was not just people who were looking for money to buy a Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and were looking for others to reach that goal. You could empathize with them because, for them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. These characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate and who needed help. <br /> <br /> The mobsters: they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the crowd can do. And I really liked this part. They also filled the story with small intricacies that made the plot much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 boys: <br /> <br /> They provided the relief of the comic in an otherwise very serious film. From Walken's embarrassing statements to the incessant references to the 90210 kids who have become happy. Their involvement in the film made it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. This is where this film seems to have lost many potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was brilliant, the use of the camera to translate the atmosphere of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered it a method that was done correctly but could always be improved, just like anything else. I appreciate both of them and congratulate Scott, the publisher, the cinematographer and the director of photography for taking real chances with this film. Not only did they go much higher with his presentation, but they went much further. The use of extremely light and extremely dark colors has given the look a sinister and ramshackle look that accurately describes the life of the crowd, bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a way that shows that their life is not like it peachy or "clean" like everyone else. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few tricks with the camera, if at all. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to get something with this look and were not doing it just for the fun of it. I realize that most of the people who watched this movie didn't expect it and that many of them were turned off in this movie, but I think it was great that Scott adopted this approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and tasteless. Many of them are shot the same way with the same twists. And I'm glad that Scott tried to do something different. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is not for everyone, but to say that it is rubbish and has nothing to offer completely misses the point. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I spent the money on this movie. I would recommend it to everyone, but I'm sure it will only hit a deal with a few. I have to agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the "MTV sphere" will not appreciate this film, but I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it because Scott and co. he took some chances and tried to offer something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think he succeeded in an extraordinary way.
