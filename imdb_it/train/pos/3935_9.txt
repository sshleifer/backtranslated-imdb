The basic link here is: Lincoln Is Slow. It is his slowness that represents his concern and decision, making him a Great Leader who is here committed to civilizing the American border alone through the great instrument of the Law. All that John Ford has again and again, including a lurking slave and the alien Death By Injun. However! The "slow" idea is also at the center of a brilliant piece of film, fun and moving to extremes. History can be a gimmick, but the story of it suggests a vision of history as a process that inspires exciting moments that seem real. Take a look at Henry Fonda's great introductory walk on the bridge, on his second surprisingly beautiful visit with his girlfriend by the river, his passion with Mary Todd on the porch and the priceless business that follows "Madam, we must hurry!" Things get thinner once we settle into the great court drama, but Fonda is priceless in everything.
