I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I understood it simply because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It didn't look particularly nice. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most intelligently composed films of recent memory. <br /> <br /> She is a woman of twenty who wants to know everything. Keep every little information it collects in a huge archive. Experience experiences in sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown making the film and seeing their reactions to the story and each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics prevented this film from being shown in the United States while its seizure by the customs had been appealed. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary that shows us the world behind the scenes of filmmakers during the narration, the fourth wall is broken. This film is the most direct way to make a film I've ever seen. The film works mainly as a capsule of the 1960s, of psychedelic struggle, freedom struggle and sexual liberation. I like to think of it much more. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I wanted to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but actually I really do. This film is a buried treasure. Give it a go.
