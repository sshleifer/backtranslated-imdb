This is the best of Shelley Duvall's high quality "Faerie Tale Theater" series. The ugly stepsisters are a relief from the Broadway quality comedy, and Eve Arden is the personification of the evil stepmother. Jennifer Beals does a great job as Cinderella straight, especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming. Jean Stapleton interprets the fairy godmother well, although I'm not sure I liked the characterization of the "lady of the south" with some lines. The relief from Steve Martin's comedy as Royal Orchestra Conductor is the quintessential Martin, but a little out of place in the show's flow. <br /> <br /> As is customary in the series, there are several ironic comments for older children (ages 15 and up). With a couple of small bumps, the show runs well, and they live happily ever after. Children up to 8 years will continue to watch it after their parents get tired - I found 3 times in a day to be a little too much.
