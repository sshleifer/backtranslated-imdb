THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on a mission to Mexico where he made friends with a penniless but likeable American businessman (Kinnear at his best) and discovers that there's more to life than death. The newbie director Richard Shepard makes his big screen debut with a decidedly bad black comedy with a keen eye for visual details and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath of fresh air in comedy friend 'formula that pierces what is anticipated of its clues and allows Brosnan to bring out his ya with a diabolical joy. A successful indie dormant gem.
