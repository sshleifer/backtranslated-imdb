I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and looks oh so familiar. And this is. All the intrigues and emotions of the plot have been explored first in other films - and perhaps even better. But despite being familiar and resistant to all the formulas of Hollywood, this film is winning and likeable at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters in the Steven Sondheim musical MERRILY WE ROLL LUNGO remained standing on the terrace of their apartment hoping to launch their new generation ("What is it called? It's called a miracle."), Sputnik has a similar effect on young rockets of this true story. While the weary citizens of their coal town of the 1950s liquidate the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket to a life in the mines. <br /> <br /> The management and the master casting make the missile boy Homer and his friends' journey seem fresh and new. The subplots concerning the teacher with young teachers are particularly interesting. The remarkable containment is shown in painting their delicate relationship. Also noteworthy is the father / son who supports the film. Perfectly played all around. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without clich√©s or intrusions. His ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and broken. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A chain of important videos that I disregard has a sign next to this film stating that you will love this movie or will refund your money. For once, I agree with them. You will never look at the October sky the same way again. <br /> <br />
