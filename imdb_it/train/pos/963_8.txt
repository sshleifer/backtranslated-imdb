Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried that he would make a film for children, because I hate to see him move away from his films I learned to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he is succeeding. Although it was the first of his films, I had seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. I bought it without seeing it and I was glad I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect children's movie and adults too should like it. The whole film reminded me so much of the films I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I liked those films because they didn't treat children like they were stupid and this one isn't. The underlying moral morality is there, but it is also as stupid as any children's film should be. Personally I was not bothered by CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and I don't think kids will notice. <br /> <br /> If you're a huge Takashi Miike fan, you might not like this. But, I suggest you give it a shot. It shows that Miike is as different and talented as I suspected he was. Furthermore, he continues to make his films signed Miike outside of these, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic like this, I suggest these other films by Miike: 'Zebraman' 'The happiness of the Katakuris'' Sabu 'and' The Bird People in China. ' <br /> <br /> Good work Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
