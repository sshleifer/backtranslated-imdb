I bought, "The Feast of All Saints", and it's not really a horrible movie, but many things could have been better. He had a lot of historical value, played by talented actresses / actors, and it is not a daily occurrence that actors can play such a role and is quite credible. There were some slightly mediocre and confusing parts, but I wouldn't say the whole movie was horrible. Once you think about it, capturing the New Orleans of the 1800s and doing something about it, it's pretty hard, and much harder to get actors that can strongly mean those parts. But the only big problem I had with the film was that most of the actors who played the free people of color were mostly light-skinned Africans, not very universal in casting others who didn't have fair skin; one of the old Creole stereotypes still existing. Those who did the casting could have chosen a wider variety when it came to tone, although many Creoles were aware of color. Rather to choose actors who looked close to white in a sense, could have been more thought out. The actors did a great job, the script could have written better, and overall I found that the performances were very credible.
