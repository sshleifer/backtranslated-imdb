I must say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and looked through the t.v. and I found "Home Room" and it was already about 5 minutes, but I got passionate. It was so interesting and moving. Show what can happen in anyone's life. I give him a 10, plus if possible. The director / screenwriter and the actors did a great job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn it from it. It was great, dramatic, mysterious and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more films like this. I loved it! I didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so beautiful. I wish he could go to the movies for more people to see him.
