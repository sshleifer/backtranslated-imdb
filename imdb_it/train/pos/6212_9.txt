I like this film deeply, despite appearing deliberately less "polished" than Fred and Ginger's other films, not to mention Harriet Hillard's somewhat problematic casting as a romantic lead. <br /> <br /> Once again with these films, the plot is of secondary importance - Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who by chance is a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and Rogers an aspiring actor in a squalid dime-a-dance music room. Although their relationship is brilliant and fun to watch, they are bogged down by a non-addictive main story by Hilliard and Randolph Scott who can't find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last minute decision, Hilliard was rather rude as he has no screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and friendly. The film could have benefited from promoting a larger and brighter character than Lucille Ball in a larger role since he simply shone in every little scene, and would have done a nice Helen Broderick attack on Rogers in this kind of brilliant film (See 'Stage Door', made the following year, for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). That Scott's one-dimensional Neanderthal character eventually falls in love with Hilliard is even more difficult to believe than Astaire is in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Now on the important part, singing and dancing: you can't say more about "Let's do music and dance" except that it's brilliant, moving and perfectly executed and I often end up watching that scene with tears in his eyes. However, other songs in the film also deserve recognition; "I'm putting all my eggs in one basket" is a fine example of Astaire and Rogers' comedic instinct, and almost mocks their reputation of bursting into spontaneous and perfectly synchronized dances. Other highlights are "I'd Rather Lead the Band" and "Let Yourself Go", which show how these two talents could perform alone as a whole. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) moments in which Astaire brilliantly plays the piano; It seems that this man's talent was infinite! <br /> <br /> In general, I actually prefer this to "Top Hat" and "Swing Time" (even if just right), since it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved, it is difficult don't like the fun factor.
