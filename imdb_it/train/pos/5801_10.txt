This film is exciting, bold and the music is very good. The film Moonwalker had to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have bad. It's excellent (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson performing "Man In The Mirror" on stage. Then, he shows a story of Michael, from his early days in the Jackson 5 to the bad age. Oh, and Badder is good too (Badder is a parody of the music videos of the Bad the single music video). Then show the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the video are really very good. which appears later. Then show the movie Moonwalker. After a few minutes, a smooth criminal plays in a club called club 30s. like when doing leanway, it's nice to see you, bye bye.
