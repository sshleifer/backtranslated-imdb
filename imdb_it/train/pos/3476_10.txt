Let's go to the point: if you're a baby boom, you've inevitably spent some time thinking about the fact that, in 1976, McCartney had the courage to enter John's hermit's life and spend the day with him. You too certainly wondered how things went. I heard exactly the same reports that the writer of this film listened to, from the perspective of John and Paul, and I admit to having reconstructed the meeting in much the same way that this film does. But none of my imaginations could have bought tears in my eyes as does this incredible job and acting. I found it incredibly realistic, perfectly plausible and 100% saccharine-free. Now, can anyone explain why I didn't hear about this masterpiece before it was shown by CBC last night? I mean, he's already three years old, for heaven's sake! And yes, if you are a Beatles fan, this is a performance not to be missed! Even the subtle paraphrase of the Beatles melodies in the background is inspired.
