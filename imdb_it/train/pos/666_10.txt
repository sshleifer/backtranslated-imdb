Episode two of the first season is a delightful holiday tale of love, betrayal ... and a homicidal madman who fled dressed as Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for her life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive like a deranged Santa Claus outfit wearing a psychopath (Larry Drake, perfectly over the top) that threatens his life ... as well as his precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered even by those familiar with the program. By the way, this particular reviewer looks at him every Christmas day on the routine. The most notable is the growing suspense and narrative twists, and All Through The Houst is among the best in Tales From The Crypt.
