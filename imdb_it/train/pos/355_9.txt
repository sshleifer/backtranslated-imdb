I, like many horror fans, have been fueled by the same powerful Hollywood budget and MTV middle school tripe over the last 20 years. Here, finally, is an original horror genre film that makes all the right boxes beat. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want fantastic weapons, you want fantastic vehicles and you want blood, lots of things, from the bucket load - you have it. <br /> <br /> With an excellent fight choreography and a supporting role of the same Hammer Horror scream queen Stephanie Beacham, this is really a fantastic stuff. <br /> <br /> Despite its low budget, choosing to use 35mm actions and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves has created something that looks much bigger. <br /> <br /> A must for the horror of old school fans.
