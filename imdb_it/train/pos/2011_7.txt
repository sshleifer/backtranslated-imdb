If you've never seen this movie and like old veteran actors, this is the movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang some great old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave an exceptional performance with lots of dancing and musical numbers. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake) gave a great supporting role along with Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who performed a classical piano and a no slap stick comedy as he did in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
