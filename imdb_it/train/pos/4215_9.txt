In this excellent film noir from Twentieth Century Fox, the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which jackals and predators survive by living each other. The urban landscapes that brood are lowered on the merciful humanity in the desolating expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> A prostitute has her bag ripped off the subway. It contains a microfilm and a communist espionage ring will go to any length to retrieve it. Two parallel investigations take place while both the spies and the policemen chase the precious information. <br /> <br /> Anti-hero pickpocket Skip McCoy is played with contemptuous confidence by Richard Widmark. He knows that the policemen are his inferior moral and intellectual peers, so he taunts them: "Go ahead," he tells Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "pull up a charge. Throw me in. You've done this before." In this ruthless world, the cops are just another band on the streets. Just like Candy, the prostitute corrupts Lightning Louie to get a lead role, so the police are busy paying pigeons for information. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when Widmark made this film it was already in childhood. The 39-year-old star, who came to the end of his contract with Fox, plays the newcomer Skip McCoy with the irreverent boldness of a teenager. Today it might not be acceptable for the romantic protagonist to punch his love interest in unconsciousness, then revive her by drinking beer in the face, but for the costumes of the period it meant hardness - and Candy, after all, is a fallen woman. br /> <br /> Jean Peters is radiant like Candy. Here, in the midst of her five-year explosion of B-movie fame, she is as beautiful and engaging as a whore with a heart of gold. She is the victim of history, a martyr of her beauty as much as anything else. She means well, but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men - Joey, Skip and the police. <br /> <br /> The real star of this film is New York. Disturbing urban landscapes and unnerving subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living and malevolent force. Like worms in a rotting cheese, human figures run through the back streets of the city. Elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks - even a dumb waiter acts like a conduit for the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche that offers security: Moe has his dirty rented room, he skips his gloomy shack on the Hudson River. While the characters move and interact, they are framed by the architecture of the bridge, or trusses of beams, or are divided by a suspended winch. The personality of the city is constantly imposed. The angles and transverse beams of the wharf beams are an echo of the grid's street plan, and the index card cabinets in the squad mimic the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the subway is blocked, it's like the nerves of steel in the city were trapping him. <br /> <br /> A surprising portion of this film is shot in extreme foreground. The character guides the plot, as it should, and close-ups are used to increase the character. When Skip questions Candy, the foreground captures the sexual energy between them, hiding the hostility of Skip's words. Jean Peters' beauty is painted with light, in a splendid soft focus foreground. The device is also used to increase the voltage. The opening sequence, the tear of the bag, does not contain dialogues: the drama is based entirely on the foreground due to its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> The nosy and the nosy with the nosy populate the film. Moe (Thelma Ritter) earns his living as an informant and his place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by his victims. When Skip observes, "she must eat," she is reciting a recurring refrain. Just like the "normal" New Yorkers promote lamb chops or lumber, the trafficking of the underground world in information goods. <br /> <br /> Yet even pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet on Moe's bed symbolize a transgression of the most fundamental moral code. Joey is beyond the pale. Moe won't trade with Joey, not even to preserve his life: "... even in our bad business, you have to draw the line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "Pick-Up" was made in the depths of the cold war. Richard Nixon had just been chosen as a candidate for the Republican vice-presidency, after making his name with his fake Alger Hiss, a communist and all-false microfilm. McCarthy's show shows were a daily reality. We see the film's policemen railing against "the traitors who gave Stalin the atomic bomb". <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant receptacle to swallow human frauds, shrieks and murders. The containers form a leitmotiv throughout the film. Moe carries his brand of ties and the candy bag, the microfilm container, is the engine of the plot. Skip retains its unique properties in a submerged box, symbolizing its secret street wisdom. The coffins of the poor, who move along the Hudson on a barge, are containers of another load moved into the ruthless metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is displayed above the skulking Skip on the ramshackle walkway of the barrack, signifying her moral ancestry. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective makes it seem bigger than Candy - violence is starting to become a noble compassion. The lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore's hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but depends on the whims of the sinister city. Enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall, or a disembodied breath of cigarette smoke. It's like the lonely cat in the trash - a predatory ghost of the night. The shooting of cameras from under hoods of taxis, inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis. We are the mulch of civilization.
