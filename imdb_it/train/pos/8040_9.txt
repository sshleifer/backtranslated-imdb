This will be a little short. First, don't listen to critics, as it's not as bad as most say it is !! Sniper uses a classic formula for cinema, which many immediately dismiss as a flaw in the film. While the sniper does not reflect 100% truth about how military snipers in our country work, it gives those who know nothing about the Professional Sniper a look into the world of the Sniper. And yes, the film has many flaws, but which movie doesn't? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I have to say that the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the film with Billy Zane in the helicopter followed by Zane in the Marine bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposite force that sweeps it !! Also there are many good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as if you were looking through a telescope. And yes, the sniper's motto is "a shot, one kills". Judge Sniper for you !! <br /> <br />
