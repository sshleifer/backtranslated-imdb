I have to admit that I was one of the skeptics to judge this show prematurely before information about it was released. I decided it would be an economic spin-off led by Ronald D. Moore who brandished the retcon wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent impression on the spectators. Accessibility is wonderful! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on developing the Cylons before the first war. (58 years before the BSG pilot events). The pilot also allows newcomers to clearly present the plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Don't be wrong: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with an engaging and cerebral drama punctuated by provocative, bold and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply stunning. The portrait of Morales by Joseph Adama, inspired by the portrait of William of Olmos, offers a splendid look at William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrait of Dr. Graystone provokes many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is an indication of what is yet to come, RDM and the creative team are ready to continue the BSG legacy of the first -create television programming with another television masterpiece created masterfully.
