In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered the public of the Depression era a momentary distraction from their problems. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theater, with the same theme of the show that must continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, the staging of songs and many of the support players themselves. <br /> <br /> All are probably classics of their genre, but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to its energetic rhythm and the command of James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street earn admirably as the production leaders of the shows, particularly Baxter as the burned Julian Marsh in search of a last box office success. However, both lack Cagney's infectious energy, which compliments perfectly with the frantic pace of staging a Broadway musical. It is an absolute vortex when it deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a girl who deals with gold digging. <br /> <br /> Obviously Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic it is. The screenplay is crackling with some double meanings recited by a superlative supporting cast with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and above all Joan Blondell who cuts everyone to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and bold and made just at the right time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Unfortunately, the thirties and a little further on would never have seen such a rich musical verve and Footlight's saxophonist again. Kindness and morality are assured.
