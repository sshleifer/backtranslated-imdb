unlike the person listed above, I felt that this movie was really funny, especially in the scenes where there was a lot of confusion. I don't want to give the plot and the plot to the people who haven't looked at it yet, but I'll say that Paresh Rawal doesn't have an extended role like the Priyadarshan films of the past, for example, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays an incredible part in the small role he was given, John Abraham does equally well, Akshay Kumar has proven to be no less in this film than he had done with Waqt and almost all of his films since Andaaz. Even though all three heroines in this film were in their debut, they did a great job playing especially Nargis who is very beautiful and sexy. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a must watch.
