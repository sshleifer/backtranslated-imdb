The summer was so full of successes and return films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of these refrains, which I was sad to find a movie in which I could just sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> In case you don't want to read further down the page (there are no spoilers), I will summarize it here: It is more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some objectionable violence parts, a lot of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but don't try to be overly trivial or go beyond its limits. Consider it a little more serious, a little more magical than the Princess Bride and you will be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I am, perhaps, not as prodigious as the others ... Perhaps once or twice a month, if I feel active. I'm also a big fan of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. I get bored of repeating stories and films with more flash than filling up faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> In the end here (August), I was tired enough of the expectations broken by the great successes that I had avoided seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. Having my hopes completely confused by Transformers for my addiction to Fiction, Stardust's previews seemed tempting, but I was certainly wary. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was completely surprised. I went to think of seeing another generic fantasy movie cliché from here to breakfast. Don't be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale, and in fact it has witches, magic and absolutely requires suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I have found, is that it is NOT based on anything I saw or read in the last 15 years, and it's really a good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of other films that seem to persistently reappear like thorns on one side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year, and two years the film would come out as another "epic fantasy, like LotR and the rest" so says the NYT and so and so no doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust didn't bolt me ​​to my place because of actions packed at every turn, and I wasn't even the one to sweat the bullets because of a plot after the plot threatened to wrest the dramatic tension apart and echoed throughout the theater in a noisy boom. He didn't even use huge sound explosions to get my attention on what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm watching you). He's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor has he offended my intelligence with confusing dialogues and plot lines that are simple enough that I could understand them in third grade (boy I hate those). <br /> <br /> I just ... watched. Watched and enjoyed a CREATIVELY refreshing texture unfolds before my eyes. Of course, I might have known what would have happened during most of the film, but it makes you forget. It even made me heart in parts, but the most important thing I noticed was that I left the theater a lot better than when I entered. <br /> <br /> It's really a gem. After so much hangover this summer with so many remakes and movies that didn't meet my expectations, it was like a cold cup of tea to mask all the hard work I had sat among others trying to get out of them with My money's worth. <br /> <br /> Probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantasy movies that stand the test of time on their own (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.) then you should really watch this movie. This little diamond is making its way into my DVD collection the moment it reaches the stores, you can trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
