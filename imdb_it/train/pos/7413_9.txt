The shower keeps inside itself in many ways. Almost the entire film takes place in an old-fashioned bathroom, with the inhabitants providing humor, pathos and emotional touches. Love and friendship between the owner and the retarded child are profound and moving. The way the older brother is attracted to this little world seems unconvinced and persuasive. The plot is tortuous, full of surprises and ironies, and overall it is touched by the sense of what I should call proximity in the relationships and conflicts of the artists. This is a film I shoot when I want to believe in the world again.
