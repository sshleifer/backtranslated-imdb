"Hot Millions" is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the wonderful assembled cast for this. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the script and appears as the key figure of an enterprising homeless person. The film, directed by Eric Till, shows no signs of being released as terribly, as some others of that period. <br /> <br /> At the center of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, sets the tax return forms for the director, who is amazed at the repayment that it is owed to him by the government. Marcus, who is a genius of numbers, sees opportunities where others would not. He starts working for a company that uses the last computer for accounting, but Pendleton is an enterprising man who finds a way to exploit the system and establish several fake accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus is assigned a secretary, who also has an apartment in his building. The inept Patty is seen working as a bus buyer who manages to make a mess of everything. The way he gets a job as a secretary is beyond comprehension, but things are never the same in the office when the terrifying Willard Gnatpole decides to follow her, but don't be afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is an experienced pianist and she is a flutist and make beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and flees with the film. Mr. Ustinov provides a secure account of the embezzler. The excellent Maggie Smith is also at her best with her portrayal of Patty, the kind woman who adores Marcus and who proves to be a genius herself when she invests the money she finds in Marcus's pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as the American responsible for the company. Even Bob Newhart looks like Gnatpole, the man who wants Patty, but he can't get her back. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity was assumed by Marcus. Cesar Romero also appears in a cameo as an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will delight all those looking for a fun time in the company of that unpleasant but fascinating character, Marcus Pendleton.
