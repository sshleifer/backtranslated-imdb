a bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living in a squalid building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the rich cigar smoker. The photograph of the river is wonderful, as is the interior decoration. If you like the decoration of Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
