In October 1945, the German American descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his bitter uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him on the Zentropa railway line as a conductor of a sleeping car. While traveling in the train, learning his profession, he sees occupied Germany destroyed and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), daughter of the former powerful transport entrepreneur and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the allied forces and the Germans and realizes the existence of a terrorist group called "werewolves" that kills ally sympathizers and leads subversive actions against allied forces. She falls in love with Katharina, and first realizes that she was a "werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pressed by the "werewolves" and needs to take a position and make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Europe" is an impressive and distressing Kafkan story by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating a magnificent black and white photograph with some colorful details, this film reveals a difficult period in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation has had to face after being defeated in the war. The action of the occupation forces that destroy resources that could allow a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country is very impressive, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an extraordinary interpretation in the role of the man who wants to remain neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everyone. Max Von Sydow's hypnotic narrative is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
