I used to watch this show when I was a child. When I think about it, I only vaguely remember it. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the initials. In addition to that, everyone was expressed. Moreover, the writing was very strong. The performances were also of a high standard. I hope some networks report it so I can see every episode. Before concluding, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network brings it back, I hope you accept it one day before it goes on forever.
