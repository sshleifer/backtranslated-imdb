I just want to add my two cents and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been published, but I feel it is worth remembering to people the everlovin genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderfully street and amusing writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that treat gamblers and the like since 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a journalist, and was originally from the Colorado, but it certainly made the scene of the east coast road. If you're not a fan of old Hollywood comedies, I'd recommend some more films based on the writings of Damon Runyon; "the Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker" are both played by Bob Hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a liberal on the West Coast, I find his politics quite amusing!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
