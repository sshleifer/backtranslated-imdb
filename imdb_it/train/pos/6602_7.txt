Likewise, Frank Miller and his Sin City comics used black and white to express themselves (and his noir influences from the cinema), as did Christian Volckman with the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It is the year 2054, in Paris. In the science fiction tradition, the future is a bright and sparkling jewel. This is a jewel in a context of misery, injustice and darkness; bright and beautiful at the top with a dark undergrowth below. One of these "brilliant" at the top, a research scientist for a large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well-known and efficient, Captain Karas (voiced by the new James Bond himself - Daniel Craig), is in charge of finding it. <br /> <br /> The plot and layout are not too original. It is strongly influenced by film noir, Gibson's Neuromancer and other detective novels, along with films such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Metropolis and Minority Report by Fritz Lang. There is the main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-plots that connect all at the end. It is not difficult to understand everything. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film are in its intense visual presentation. Paris is a complex set of levels and sublevels. At its base is the most primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. However, in this structure, the summit is not equivalent to the elevation of human ideals and behaviors. Paris was intensely animated and set up in brilliant black and white. The film is closer in spirit with Sin City (the comics) then Sin City, the film was with its starting material. This is made even easier, since it still remains relatively in the same medium; animation. Like a scanner, it obscurely pushed the visual aspects of the narrative, so does this. Light and darkness, white and black create an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning, at the same time it is right in front of us. The film shows how black and white can be ambiguous and obvious at the same time. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the spirit of the film, I can be a critic and a fan. I can love and hate in the same light. It is certainly an experience that I recommend to lovers of visual arts. So pour another Black and Tan, enter the void and enjoy the journey.
