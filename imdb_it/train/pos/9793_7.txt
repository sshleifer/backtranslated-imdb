I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the bad guys have been interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting game "guess who". The film, however, needs more Robin. He appeared in the film at the beginning and sporadically during the rest. I always thought the new animated series didn't do justice to Robin's new character, not to mention Knightwing. This film continues that ugly tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his love story that would not be so bad in a film if the love story wasn't so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I would recommend you watch it.
