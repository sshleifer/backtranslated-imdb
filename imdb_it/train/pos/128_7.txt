Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his films, placing his film world in the midst of the real world and the imagined world. So, as spectators, we think we look at a "real" story while in reality we are completely manipulated, often to the point that the film acts disturbingly (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idioterne). Obviously the Dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (as well as creating some welcome spotlights on Von Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, he seems to balance his relationship with everyone else, but soon he becomes a victim of the problems that others have created in the past for themselves. The idealist must inevitably reject society to remain idealistic and become the terrorist. Humanity is ruined and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) nuances about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical result, the film is wonderfully designed: faded colors that move and fade, overlapping screens, action on different layers (with the footage of the mayor becoming the most interesting). In this film we can see how Von Trier's film handles the film as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to deviate from this (as if he were no longer interested in technical results because they become so readily available).
