This typical Mamet movie offers a quiet and uniform view of what makes a man of confidence (Joe Mantegna) good. Explored as a psychological study by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), he slowly drags her into his world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The cast includes some of the characters found in several Mamet films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good job. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie and I often wondered why she didn't become a more famous player than she became. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places! <br /> <br /> The film proceeds at a slow pace, with a flat dialogue, yet maintains a level of tension during which it logically leads to the bang-up ending. You would expect a real disappointment at the end, but I found it encouraging and satisfying. I love this movie!
