"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thought out film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I saw that movie late one night, excited about what would happen. I was not disappointed. At the end of the film, I was impressed. I couldn't get it out of my head. The whole idea simply upset me. The ending was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot was also something that kept me interesting to the end. The cast, superb. It was a wonderful film. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie to make you interested forever.
