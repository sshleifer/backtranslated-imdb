A single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working with a minimum wage. When he is fired, he finds that he is unable to support his children (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the last of whom has asthma. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Soon, he becomes addicted to the drugs he is selling. His life is falling apart, especially when his children, the eldest son, discover the truth and threaten to leave it. So, he tries to redeem himself with the help of his children, but can he protect his family from the drug lords he worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This movie of a lifetime has some of the best acting I've ever seen! Diane Keaton stands out a lot, and her character looks like crazy but she was extremely convincing. It is much more suited to theater than to comedy. However, the best performance of the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays the eldest son. He is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but tries to be the adult of the family. His acting was especially great in the scenes he confronts his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job. <br /> <br /> A film that is worth watching, especially for the acting of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
