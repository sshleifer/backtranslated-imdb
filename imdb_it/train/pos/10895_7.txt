Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly fun movie, especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is fun as a hideous millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. So it drives the family crazy with excessive indulgence for Christmas cheer. I haven't been a Ben Affleck fan in the past (although I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well portrayed in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter of the family who at first can't stand Affleck's character. Sure, you can see where this movie is going, but you don't care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
