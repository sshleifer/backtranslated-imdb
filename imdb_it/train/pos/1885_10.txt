This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently I was happy to see it on DVD, which is a relief from looking at the old grainy versions of VHS. <br /> <br /> I hadn't seen it for years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the film resists time. It is one of those rare and perfect comedy storms in which great writing (a really fun line after a really fun line) is accompanied by great direction and exceptional performances all at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore got an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won for best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win the best actor Oscar, it is proof that no comedian could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon Keeps the movie beautifully true to each of the characters and the warm tone of the story. Quite simply, IMHO the film is a rare gem. It's just sad that Steve Gordon died only a year after the publication of "Arthur". <br /> <br /> As for the DVD available from 1/2007, it's so / so. Although the quality of the video is a step ahead of the old VHS copies, the widescreen version is not yet available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some extras that are nice but not enough. An example is the comment of the director who says how much he wanted that some takes and deleted scenes could be included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult choices for a final change. The DVD, being the perfect format to include this material, surely should have offered it too. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for books.
