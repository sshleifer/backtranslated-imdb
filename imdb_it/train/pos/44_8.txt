When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another movie. I was wrong. This film sends a powerful message about the judgment of others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met, I recommended this movie a. No one came back saying it was bad. Busy, he also did a great job with his role in this film. I don't know much about his acting career, but wow, the way he pulled off the end of this fill was great. <br /> <br /> At first it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie starts again. I have no idea why this film was not mentioned in the film world. My desire would be that this film be re-released and advertised more ... because it sends a powerful message in just an hour and a half.
