I haven't read the Kurt Vonnegut book from which it was adapted yet, but I'm familiar with some of his other works and was interested in seeing how it would be translated on the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of the Vonnegut novels. It's about the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to ingratiate himself with high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to Americans through his weekly radio show. But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but flees to New York, where various twists await. <br /> <br /> If Mother Night has a problem it is that it tends to be a bit too sentimental sometimes. But for most of the film the schmaltz is reduced to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried out with skill and ease. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a top-level Nazi in a prison cell. Highly recommended
