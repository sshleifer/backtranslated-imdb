** Warning Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90s. It was an extraordinary achievement for all those involved, in particular the acting of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones has painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But alas ... <br /> <br /> constantly, and unjustly compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they both concern Scots in historic Scotland. However, this comparison often bothers me because it seems almost obvious that "Braveheart" is a better film than "Rob Roy". I really like "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it to "Rob Roy" is a little offensive to me. Simply put, I love "Braveheart", but it's a pale shadow as far as I love "Rob Roy". Here are my special reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" talks about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. He is a legend, a martyr, a bigger figure than life. Because of this representation, he is also a perfect person, never wrong, and in practice shows his Scottish compatriots to the promised land. When he finally fails, it's not his fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the same people he trusted most. It also goes through the worst kind of torture because it wants freedom so much. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective. But it doesn't really inspire me or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more fascinating than human perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings", and it's also one of the reasons why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy can be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that have influenced the lives of many of his loved ones. Now of course, not to make false claims against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of selfishness and self-centeredness. Let's not forget that the relatives he claimed to protect were hunted by the homeless at the end of the film due to this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask for. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife, Mary, is also a normal and ambiguous person. But let's start with what it looks like in this film. Of course, she is beautiful, but she does not wear make-up and practically allows her to show her natural beauty. Compare it with the two loves (or one, according to your point of view) by William Wallace in "Braveheart". Now these two women are hot, but barely indicative of how women looked at the moment (especially the laity). Perhaps it is not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy's attempts at accuracy are much more effective. <br /> <br /> In "Rob Roy", Mary must live with her fierce rape with the cowardly carrion, Cunningham. He feels compelled to tell Rob about his fight, but he doesn't because he knows Rob has to get revenge for his rape. Such revenge would surely mean Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The bad guys in "Rob Roy" are just as addictive. Although the enemies of "Braveheart" are well written, they are not original. Robert the Bruce, a brave and cowardly man, is tormented by moral decisions that are all familiar in the realm of fiction. Should he take his claim as king of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace in order to guarantee the security of his surname? Bruce is the most ambiguous character of "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Giulio Cesare" to Fredo in "Il Padrino Parte II", these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks, although an irresistible villain, is very one-dimensional. It is the epidemic of evil, and its tyrants are in direct contrast to Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three villains who are wonderful in their quirks. First of all, let's start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his own self-image that he is willing to let an innocent man suffer for it. "Look I'm not mocked" are his favorite words for his "factor". He is a man obsessed with power, upset by the fact that a man of great nobility, like the Duke of Argyll, can be considered more provident than he. He is shamefully obsessed with himself and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are the "Rob Roy" conspirators, and they are also Roy's direct assailants. Callarn is so shrewd in his cowardice that he is almost comical. He will do anything to maintain the marquis's good will, which includes backstabbing and deception. Cunningham is an irresistible character as he seems to have been relieved to do everything possible to obtain the marquis's status and affection. He needs a father, he doesn't know that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn, he grasps it without even questioning it. It is very similar to the evil of modern man, so self-centered and vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as exaggerated. I say Hogwash. It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil, but also psychopathic throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for fun, is Cunningham too much of an incredible character? We live in a society where people seem to have diminished the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this diminished value have changed. It is a problem in human history that the vanity of the human heart does not allow the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary make us hope that goodness prevails, but in our world there will always be snakes. <br /> <br /> Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Mary, and has a direct irritation for the Marquis and his factor. It gives the world hope for the people of power. We hope that people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting than the 10 battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <br /> One thing I get tired of are people who tell me that "Braveheart" is a better film because of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are not original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has had a long tradition of historical scenes of European battles. "Braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever filmed, but they suffer from a major problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong, the duels aren't even original. In fact, there are probably 10 times more movies with duels than there are battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. It is one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the fighting style and bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham is effected and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a broad sword. Cunningham fights with quick complicated movements, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The entire film, from the first minute deliberately slow to the exciting second part, is leading up to this moment. It's powerful stuff, and it's clear that Rob must exterminate this threatening evil that has plagued his entire world. When finally Rob takes over (literally and figuratively), it is one of the greatest moments in the history of cinema. Rob wins because he has more to live, and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham. The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. The prevailing good against a real evil is more powerful for me than to see a boy being gutted only so that he can shout "FREEDOM!" But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I don't know that the people of the aristocracy or Scottish spoke like the people in "Rob Roy", but I think it's clearly an attempt to capture their linguistic patterns. I feel that many people are bored by "Rob Roy" simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying. In this case, read some Shakesphere or add subtitles. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90s. Many dialogues in this film are smart, but maybe you have to watch the movie a couple of times to understand it. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is not very interesting. Sure, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? This is a legend and clearly there was no attempt to capture the language of the times. This film takes place several centuries before "Rob Roy", yet they speak like today's people. So the reason many people like it better. Today the public has become increasingly lazy and does not want to take the time or patience to understand the things that are complex. Therefore, as in many epic films, they expect to see the villagers speak of a recognizable English accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far from our American language. Of course, it is clear that Wallace is Scottish, but in addition to looking like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of "Aye" for recognition, the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe the Scots should play. <br /> <br /> So, do these descriptions show that "Rob Roy" is a better film than "Braveheart"? Almost. But if it shows one thing, it shows that it is not known at all that "Braveheart" is a better film than "Rob Roy". To put it in simple words, "Rob Roy" is a film that has themes that are very relevant in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about a legend that is stimulating but hardly realistic. You can make a decision about what you think is best ... <br /> <br /> Grade - A Score - 9
