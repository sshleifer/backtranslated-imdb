The Night Listener caught my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who falls in love with his friendship with a very sick 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin). Williams never met the guy in person, since they were in touch just talking on the phone. However, Williams's ex-boyfriend (good work by Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, which leads Williams to organize a meeting with him in person. What follows has a permanent impact on Williams in a way you don't expect. I'll leave it to that. Even Toni Collette is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, with Toni Collette who memorably interpreted Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also acted as a friend of Williams. The Night Listener is inspired by real events and has a gloomy, almost eerie silence. Sometimes it's predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the film and only because of logic, but I liked it anyway. I like Williams in roles like this, much more than his comic characters, so it was an added benefit for me. Recommended. 8/10
