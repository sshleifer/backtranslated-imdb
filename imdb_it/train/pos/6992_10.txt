I wouldn't say this is a bad movie; in fact it is rather typical of the type of film that the "poverty" studios publish at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role as a somewhat demented doctor-scientist, disguised as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his henchmen have the bad habit of stealing young brides and, after their death, inject Bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies to maintain her young age. Lugosi is more than up to the task of making this film enjoyable, however, the film suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (good name for a guy in a horror movie) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen it in numerous movies and TV shows and he's still the same; stiff, wooden and absolutely unconvincing. Miss Walters is only slightly better, but she also lacks the acting talent to make her role credible. However, the viewer can enjoy the great Lugosi reciting yet another base scheme just to be foiled in the end! Despite the poor acting of some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a fun movie to watch for everyone.
