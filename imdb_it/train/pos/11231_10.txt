I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier is an excellent series of science fiction films and I can't wait to see more I just started watching this series of films last week and I can't get enough. I've already recommended it to other people to watch as it's worth seeing. I've already watched every episode many times and I'm waiting to see more episodes coming out. I rated it a ten, but I think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers staff for an excellent job. If you like Star Trek I highly recommend taking a look at this science fiction movie. The detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially for the ships and planets used in it
