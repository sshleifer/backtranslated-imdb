No Strings Attached presents Carlos Mencia as a stand-up who makes us laugh and think. Not only does he mock racial issues (as many supporters claim), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated the same way ... because Americans are crazier than Arab terrorists ... because no one needs to pray for the Pope - and what he hopes is doing in heaven ... a theory about how the Easter traditions (aka Big Ups to Jesus Day) began. .. his vision of the movie Passion of Christ - and his sub-sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he is affected by Jesus ... how society should treat physically disabled people ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it never ceases to remind us that each of us has a voice. So we should use it to tell the truth, to say what we think, and not to be afraid if others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
