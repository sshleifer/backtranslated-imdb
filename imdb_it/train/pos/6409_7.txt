I hadn't heard of Brashear before seeing it. This is the story of him and the man who trained him, helping him become the first African American US Navy Diver. A story of willpower. The plot is well written and develops well everywhere. This is what it seems, the typical loser thing, and does not reserve too many surprises. It's also quite Hollywood, but hey, I don't know the real man, maybe it's close to how it really happened. However, he gets the job, with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way, and this is inspirational for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can't" talk about their dream of a lifetime. The recitations are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both shine every time they are on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well cared for and has good cinematography. Production values ​​are high, and this does a fairly convincing job of bringing us back to the 1950s. This is the only film I saw from this director and the writer, although I can now consider investigating more of them. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds the subject and / or fan of those who made it interesting. 7/10
