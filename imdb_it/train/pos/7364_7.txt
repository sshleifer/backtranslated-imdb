It is not always easy to explain what a film is like, but this time I think I found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small time criminals who used drugs and doing stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). <br /> <br /> It is about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is going out of prison, the other has not yet been captured. With a stolen vehicle they cross the Scottish countryside, but remain without petrol. While trying to find fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks he wants to rob him and points a gun at one of them. But everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run away. What follows is a man who hunts through the fields and woods of Schotland. The two friends must literally run to save their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently this film was shot in just 12 days. OK, it's not exactly incredible because most of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still find it quite surprising. Especially since this is not really a bad movie. Maybe it's not the greatest film of all time, but they can still be proud of what they have achieved. I enjoyed watching it and overall I liked the movie. I give him a 7/10.
