I really enjoyed this movie. I rented this expecting something bad to spend an evening. It was a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a film that didn't want to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with a certain meaning and moral values. Manages on both fronts. The protagonists are all good, but above all the guy who plays, he also wrote and produced the film. I've never seen any of these actors before, but they were nice and made me worry about what happens to them in the end that is saying a lot. The script is intelligent and engaging and looks refreshing. I think you won't be disappointed to see this.
