I recently saw this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I would see the films I missed. I had no expectation for the film, so I was stunned that this film escaped me completely. It's a compelling story of father and son, and it's also a lost story. I even shed a tear in the end of this fabulous tale. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I gave her a 9 out of 10 is that it slows a little in the middle, but eventually it comes back strong. The acting was great, the story was magnificent and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film. GO SEE THIS FILM! Rent it, buy it, look at it, I LOVE it! I know I did it!
