If you like Star Wars / Trek, come and see where they got all their movie ideas and devices. They are my first 2 favorite movies of all time, others worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the basic material ("The Tempest" by Shakespeare) is not obscured by the whizbang gimmickry (a posteriori Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, don't assume that you can "see the ropes" by holding up the flying saucer. This was the first movie where you CAN'T. The miracle was realized in "A-movie" scale, economy and tastes at the time were heavily stacked against it. And the previous "success" of director Wilcox was "Lassie Come Home". Until I looked at it, I thought "Fred Wilcox" was a pseudonym of a director who had already become famous or later, but at the time he didn't want to be associated with science fiction, which was strictly a "B" genre then. This was a very VERY visionary production, or a very fortuitous "mistake" on the part of those who finance Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are large-scale bricks with the almost microscopically inserted live action that Lucas has used extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotyped "user interface"; "computer", as they came to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. The Star Trek "transporter" is there, visually, almost unaffected by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the technobabble Trek / Wars turns you off, the scientific references of FP are not exaggerated and are all precise, even today. The "ship" set is complete, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything "Trek" has done for the TV or movie. We didn't spend as much time as I wanted. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies came to space so competently, watching FP will explain all this. It is definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
