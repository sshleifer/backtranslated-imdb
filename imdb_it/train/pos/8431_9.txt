] Haven't you seen this movie? Have you ever heard of this movie? It wouldn't surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio has believed in the film and has never been chosen for mass distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited circulation with virtually no promotion, and most of the major film critics didn't even bother to see it again. I imagine that a film based on a single act, a series of apartheid games and its effect on two individuals has never had a chance in today's market - and it is the clever loss of the movie lover. <br /> <br /> records, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar's nominations (as did the director of photography), but the film received such fanfare that I can't even blame the academy on that . This is a stimulating, stimulating and heartbreaking film, which in effect requires the public to meet him according to his own terms. Taking this into consideration, it's definitely not a mindless entertainment movie. Director John Berry has not wisely attempted to disguise Athol Fugard's comedy. Of course, we are given some fragmented flashbacks and some breathtaking shots, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains, overall, a story of two people living in inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) no longer have anyone attacking them. A third character joins them for a while (Willie Jonah, surprising in a largely silent role), but the attention of the film never strays from the characters of the title and from what they have become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as broken pairs, performances that simply could not be improved. Vigorous and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered from home video. Hands off, the best film of the year 2000.
