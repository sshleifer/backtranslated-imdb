While returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip, a battered housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival after a disagreement with a group of young delinquents takes a violent turn. <br /> <br /> Suffering the humiliation of a DVD right here in the UK, Susan Montford's directorial debut may not be given the recognition she deserves. This is a shame, as the standard of writing, directing and acting is really very good, and surely exceeds the quality of your average DVD dvd. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger offers her best performances over a period of time as the oppressed wife of a violent husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer is given nothing to do but be a threatening presence, it is in their brief scenes together that Basinger connects, showing a painful vulnerability that alludes to the anger that will eventually boil up against him with young people. It's a really great performance, its transformation from the victim to the aggressor is played without problems. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas At first I thought it was a mixed bag, since he (along with the other three young men) didn't look like much of a threat. However, if all four young people were physically more impressive, the subsequent scenes in which Basinger turned their tables against them would not work at all. The fact that these are four average men, even if slightly upset, is the key to why the film works so well. <br /> <br /> Apart from some stimulation problems during the second half of the film and a couple of lines of cheese here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that leaves the viewer something to think about when the movie is over. Some may be discouraged by the slow-fire nature of the opening scenes or by the sudden end. Others from the sometimes brutal violence. I say give it a chance, it is certainly more worthy of your time than Saw V.
