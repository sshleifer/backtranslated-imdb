Although written by Stephen King, an overrated writer, if there ever was one, this is actually quite a fun B-movie. Vampirics, incestuous creatures that live in the house lit by candles and drain the life force of the virgins, great cemetery scenarios, heroic cats and a very pretty virgin. The soundtrack also has the music of Enya, an idea that I found quite ... pretty. I'm sure that King is disappointed with this little movie, although he has disgusting dialogues and ideas, all of them coming from a real boring clothesline of the king. (Although Sleepwalkers, if I understand correctly, is a script without any novel or story behind it). Yet, those touches of smells of sewage show that he never used a ghost writer, after all ...
