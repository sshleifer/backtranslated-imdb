Radiofreccia is a film about all of us, our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant film in which a group of friends like us all lives through the difficulties of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades of the last century. The film does not have a happy or sad approach to things, it just tells us a story, which we could all have lived. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and pain. The power of this story is that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies that you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the small town of Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to finally be able to walk through its streets near Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio that plays on Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams . Radiofreccia will make you laugh, make you cry sometimes, shock you and console you, give you and take you. I personally think he played an important role in my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest you all look at it and make it part of yours.
