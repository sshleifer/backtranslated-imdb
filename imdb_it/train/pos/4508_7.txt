I was struck by the beautiful photography of this film, which was shot in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see many activities in which the Eskimos are involved, such as hunting, dancing, igloo building, etc. And their habits, like offering their wives to visitors, are routine in history. The hunting sequences were sometimes taken up in the repertoire, since it was easy to recognize some scenes of rear projection of animals, but even these were fascinating. Salmon underwater fishing, walrus hunting, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale have sometimes made a documentary seem. There was no cast list, which strengthened the documentary flavor. The filmmakers tried to make it look very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was translated by someone on the screen or by a caption. The introduction stated that, with the exception of the white traders and the Royal Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was absolutely not true. The two protagonists, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but they were professional actors with credits for previous films and it was clear that they sometimes had make-up. But they were excellent in their roles and continued to have a career in Hollywood. All in all, the film is definitely worth a visit.
