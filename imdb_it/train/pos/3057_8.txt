Wow, I really enjoyed this movie, William H. Macy is as big as the quiet hit-man Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married killer (like his father) with a small child, is going through a mid-life crisis and wants to leave the family business, so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place meets the spiritually free young people Sara falls in love with. One day Alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch it if you like mature, interesting films. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
