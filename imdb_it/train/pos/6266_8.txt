This image has a very high score for me as it is a fun and entertaining parody of Alien Invaders that conquer a city and many of its men. <br /> <br /> The city and the players are all embellished with the style of the 50s and the whole film has a deliberately sticky and kitsch appearance. Some scenes are hilarious like the birth of an alien creature. <br /> <br /> All the actors give full-blooded and serious shows that make the movie even more fun and the special effects and the Aliens are at least intentionally seem like third rate to add to the fun. <br /> <br /> These types of films often deserve a cult following: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
