This is an extremely dense, gloomy and complicated film that unfolds quite slowly, revealing harrowing details, like the attention paid in a novel, and watching this movie "It's" like watching a novel unfolding. While I wasn't interested in the narrator, because I felt that he was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film features some of the best actors I've ever seen, and the main character, Summer Phoenix, is fabulous. His innocence and naivety may find it implausible, a sort of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this criticism, but it's still fabulous, partly because it's different from anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so unique about this film is how it never shows what you expect. It is always surprising and, despite its length, the film never reveals more than necessary. At 163 minutes, it is extremely concise, guiltily, I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. It is full of brief moments that are simply amazing, some of the best that can be seen throughout the year, and all these moments add up to an extraordinary cinematic experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater was not seen in the films from Cassavetes' "Opening Night", or perhaps "Limelight" by Chaplin. But, believe it or not, this film is much less "conventional". I never knew where this movie went, and now, having seen it, it still has many possibilities. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
