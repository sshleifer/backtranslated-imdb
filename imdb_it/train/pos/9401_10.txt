What a wonderful film, suitable for so many labels that it never gets: science fiction, film-noir, with a script and a dialogue of high intelligence that presupposes a cultured and cultured audience ..... the type of film in English made only in pre-1960 England (and shown only in US movie houses upon arrival), and never, never in the United States. <br /> <br /> Main characters in The Man in the White Suit (1951) played by Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood usually use polysyllabic words of scientific reference as "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry as "molecules long chain "and therefore communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits that science offers him. > <br /> The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosion films that now (2009) dominate world cinema and certainly dominate American cinema ......., he told intelligently the story delivered by educated and credible and educated English actors (who applauds? educated and accomplished people), and it is all done with comedy, charm, pathos and sense of irony that the ancient Greek dramatists would have approved. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie, and some day, somehow, some worthy director and his supporters should make another one. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
