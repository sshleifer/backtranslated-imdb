I saw this film premiered on Friday (1/19) in Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in a theater and listening firsthand to the anguished soldiers crossing was almost more than I could bear. The other members of the public were equally excited and while we wanted to leave, the least we could do was to testify that these men and women shared their experience with us. Present were Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film. While they may be at home now, you can say that this war is still within them and probably always will be. Whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
