The dentist was created at a time when almost all professions had his psycho. We had crazy police officers, ambulance men, secretaries and this was only for beginners. The dentist has arrived surprisingly late because going to the dentist is usually every man's nightmare. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted. The super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives a perfect life in his big "white house", he has a beautiful blonde wife and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of an ugly IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen), dirty pool cleaner who "cleans" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to have passed through the dark filter. He goes crazy and starts taking care of people's teeth in an ugly way. And you don't want to come on his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna has produced fashionable horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film Society was a great spinoff from John Carpenter's They Live. The film's producer Pierre David is known in films like Scanners. The cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from Los Angeles Law and Major League, but I could dream of him later as a psychotherapist. He was really good at his role and he was kind of a sad person. Linda Hoffman was as beautiful and silent as Feinstones' wife. Micahel Stadvec didn't have many jokes, but after seeing him with the ladies of the neighborhood I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was handsome as a cop on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager who is going to be Feinstone's next client. <br /> <br /> Final warning: if you are like me and have problems with the dentist then maybe you should skip this. But if you want to try, you should prepare yourself with dark humor and very bad tricks.
