I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before taking it to the store. Bill Paxton has hired some first-rate talents to make a good thriller with interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both offer excellent performances. The story is told in an interesting way with both flashbacks 20 years ago, then appears in the present, alternating back and forth. This style of storytelling makes a good thriller that can't get boring. Bill Paxton, please, make more horror movies, you have the talent!
