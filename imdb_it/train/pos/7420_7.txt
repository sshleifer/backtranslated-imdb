Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who wouldn't want to see Elvis Pressly instead? With drug addiction and falling from supreme fame it may have frightened Elvis' agent to be part of the film, it was a mistake. This would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from terrifying, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job of creating an original soundtrack for this piece / musical "period". A bit like a love story, this is more of a drama about falling from grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of history is dead. Furthermore, Gary Busey is perfect again in a non-perfect role.
