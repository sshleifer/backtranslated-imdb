That's My Bush is a live project by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after a season, not due to bad reviews (actually got positive reviews), but because it was very expensive. it's a pretty funny parody of a media network television sitcom. It is also a political satire. Now this is not at all as good as South Park, but it's a very funny parody of a sitcom and also a good political satire. the guy who plays in what is my bush looks very similar to him! If you can find the show, take a look. There are lots of laughs to do! <br /> <br /> 9/10
