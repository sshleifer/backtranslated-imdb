After too many years of waiting, the famous 1979 book by Anne Rivers Siddons "The House Next Door" was finally filmed. The result vanishes a little from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy, is understandable if unsatisfactory as it is a TV movie, everything is absorbent and actually very good, but not as exceptional as the book, one by Stephen Even King's favorites and one of mine. <br /> <br /> With more execution time and fewer constraints as a film release, all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the menacing ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, particularly the climate revelation towards the end. <br /> <br /> However, the entire cast does well in this thoughtful tale of maleficence without mind. There are some unnecessary economic shocks, but the growing atmosphere of terror is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by his amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize his corruption on canvas. <br /> <br /> Make sure you read the great novel.
