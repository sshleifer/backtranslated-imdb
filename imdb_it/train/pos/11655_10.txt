There are too many topics avoided in the cinema and the eating disorder is one of them. This film shows it as it is. It is not glamorous for viewers to enjoy, it is shown with the true truth that makes it even more powerful.

It is a very powerful film and it is a good support for anyone suffering from an eating disorder to give them the will to stop. Here's what movies should do: they should be there to help people and not to fascinate the things that are wrong.
