The film was very moving. It was tender and fun at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning shows. Olympia Dukakis was fantastic. I understand because of the plot that his part had to be short, but I wanted to have seen more of it, he is a true professional. You will be able to remember the experiences of your life, we hope positively after seeing this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in Q & A after watching. He is a wonderful, intelligent, eloquent man and a "real person". It was really a pleasant evening! This is a must-see movie. You'll be so grateful you went.
