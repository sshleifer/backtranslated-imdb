Shirley MacLaine in another bespoke role. Like the aunt of a single mother in a 1962 working-class Chicago neighborhood, the veteran actress gets another workout like a gritty woman who won't let the setbacks defeat her spirit of success. The children, a pre-teen boy and girl, are attracted to their lively Aunt Zoe, although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her, and applied to all the wrong opportunities eventually expelled them from school. <br /> <br /> The plot is cleverly wrapped in the Cuban missile crisis, with all the social implications. Men who built air-raid shelters, people who looked at news programs about what seemed to be the only TV in a restaurant, and a general fog of discomfort and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is swept away by proportions, the climatic conclusion makes the viewer pleasant anyway. Yes, Virginia, tomorrow the sun will come! Clearly a small-budget production, this is still a small sweet film, full of the magic that the Sunday Matinees were made of. With few "Oldies" chosen in an effective Sound Track, the whole family is sure to enjoy it. ****
