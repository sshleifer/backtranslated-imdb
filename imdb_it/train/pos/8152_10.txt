I have just read the most recent comments on this film and I would like to respond. you are probably not familiar with the original story of the rap group N.W.A. dating back to the beginning of 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the band to go alone and finally in 1991, the band broke up when Dr.dre left. which led to a sack of beef since the departure of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. this story was somehow based on this. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the more this movie was a 90-minute laugh, the way they explained that the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious. not to mention the tasty "love song" he was connecting. and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked, just like the record company manager is also hilarious and have the managers being shot every time. <br /> <br /> people who didn't like this movie probably didn't get it or they were complete idiots, my opinion
