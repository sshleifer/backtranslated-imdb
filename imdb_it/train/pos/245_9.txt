The only reason I wanted to see him was because of Orlando Bloom. In short, the film was spectacular in the media. It's not bad, but it's not very good. Assembly is good; the film is well structured. The management is competent and insured. The story is struggling. The film is on average played by Ledger, Bloom, and normally by the great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you come from the United States so sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film, I was neither bored nor moved. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I have to say that I didn't care at that point. <br /> <br /> Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom type, shows some range suggestions (although often presenting the "I'm pretty and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls could find the matinee value. Besides that, I just don't see it. It is neither good enough nor bad enough to be fun.
