Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better film than I thought. I never thought this film would meet my expectations. True, this film started slowly, but with the passage of time the film became more of my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and concerns a boy named Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an extraordinary adventure of his own. Along the way, he must love friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice cast is large. They certainly know how to bring films with their vocal talent. Music is nothing special, but still nice. The entertainment isn't the best, but it's still pretty good. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I consider this film 9/10.
