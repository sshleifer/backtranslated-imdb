*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> this film always seems very exaggerated, until I remember that my university campus had an ex-student-become-Nazi-racist-murderer-who-then- he committed suicide even his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> look for it in wikipedia- I added some photos to their article about him. <br /> <br /> it's hard to believe, but he's not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
