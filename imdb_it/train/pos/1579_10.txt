I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where he received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before - that is about the Rosenstrasse revolt (a street in Berlin) of kind German women married to Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it's a unique story, and what's more, it's the only Holocaust film I've ever seen that shows that there were good Germans (the help family in "Anne Frank" for example was Dutch) ) that did NOT support the Nazis and, indeed, had the strength to oppose the immorality and brutality of their country during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their own lives. The acting is exceptional, the plot of the New York plot is interesting and intricate, the direction of Von Trotta is masterful in every scene and the production values, including the splendid photography, are exceptional. Obviously the New York family could speak German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native language with their family - a common occurrence. So the criticism is unjustified. Saying more would ruin the experience. The film is long, but I haven't looked at my watch once. I hope this film has a certain distribution in North America, because not only is this film a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity that people have towards Germans thanks to their support for Hitler. If this movie is shooting in your area, I INVITE YOU TO SEE IT! You'll be glad you did!
