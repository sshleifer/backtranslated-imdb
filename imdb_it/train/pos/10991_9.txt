Cypher is a film that is worth seeing because it is not the sci-fi movie at large. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a sort of macro vision of what is happening. The close view of the camera is how the director maintains the illusory plot. The science-fiction aspect of the film is secondary to the film's plot. The technology used in the film is not overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of props. <br /> <br /> The character development is intentionally superficial. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself in the world of espionage. It is up to the public to discover its enigmatic character and it is the enigma that keeps the public interested until the end.
