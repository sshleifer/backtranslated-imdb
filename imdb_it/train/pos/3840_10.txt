Jerome Crabbe plays the lead role in this film. I've seen this movie 6 times and I'm still not tired of this movie. This film is similar to Flesh + Blood in some way. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all his films all except for the Showgirls. He doesn't like my mother so much but I don't agree. I think all of his films are a race to look especially at Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith has made some of his films that include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith would never die. Dutch films are different but still fun.
