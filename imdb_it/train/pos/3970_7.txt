This is a film that apparently seems to relate to J. Edgar Hoover who pats himself on the shoulder to fight the Klansmen, chase after the Indian killers, drive out the famous gangsters of the 1930s, fight the Nazis in the United States and South America during World War II and Commies in New York in the early 1950s. Of course in 1959 we did not know of Mr. Hoover's obsession with keeping secret documents about honest Americans, annoying people like Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr, but worst of all, his secret love affair with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to learn more about this topic, I suggest you see the film Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, This story of a life in the FBI told by Jimmy Stewart is a decent film, but dated. Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is the film. As much as Hoover controlled production and always ensured that the FBI was seen without fault, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, a fairly important result considering that Hoover always looked over his shoulder. Even the background score is nice. I have read recent online articles that suggest this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it a long time ago and I hope they show it again.
