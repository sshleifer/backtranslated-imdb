This was one of the best episodes of all time. Agent Sean Cooper was killed in his patrol car back in 1968. A dying inmate in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after filming. His case has reopened with the presumption of having been bribed as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Further investigation of him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This kind of love was considered shameful and something at least kept hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of love I personally endorse, he was still a policeman and a human being and should not have been killed for it. The soundtrack was excellent (it makes me look at the DVR) and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize an object or give a particular sensation to a scene was particularly attractive. I will watch this in repetition!
