This film answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous .. and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women? <br /> <br /> Without ruining the film, you can safely make sure that you don't, but there is a lot of fun to do along the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as the super-heroine mercurial, a super drunk, mysteriously called G-Girl, who unlike most of her sisterhood, is not * always * dedicated to truth, justice and the American Way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as the complete daft, yet somewhat appealing, curator Jenny. When it is unloaded for a less gifted but more emotionally secure and well-adjusted rival, G-Girl becomes ballistic, and what follows is not nice. It's funny, but it's not cute .. <br /> <br /> It's a delightful premise, hell has no fury like a scorned super-heroine, and the people involved don't take it away, but it has its moments , and I think I'll get the DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
