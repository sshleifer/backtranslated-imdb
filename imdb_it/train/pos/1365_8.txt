He-he-bye !! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your own lover of the New Yorker, independent and lover of the early 90s. Together with his party friends, he meets a mature Turkish salesman. It's a very successful story for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a slacker grow up in a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only abilities were able to hold while they were hammered and crazy to throw good holidays. <br /> <br /> Side note, Parker Posey makes this film fantastic. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie makes me want to watch all of her movies. There are subtle mannerisms that have perfected his character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure you watch this movie. Repeated views are a must.
