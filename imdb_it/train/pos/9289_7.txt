In THE BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a true US envoy who was responsible for Japan's true opening to international relations in the late 1950s. Before him, Commodore Perry basically went to Japan with gunboats and forced a treaty on the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived shortly thereafter, worked out the details and helped ensure compliance, as many of the Japanese had no particular inclination to honor the first treaty. All this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources I found, the love story between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is mostly fiction and this love story is very much at the center of this film (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction is the first time I saw this film it was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! When he is a diplomat in most films, he says, please and thank you while he is full of people !!!! So seeing him play a man who is NOT a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed really weird. In fact, I can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I saw that the photos of Harris and Wayne bear virtually no resemblance to him. <br /> <br /> However, although the story has taken many liberties with the truth and the strange cast, the film is still very watchable. Color cinematography is beautiful, the film shows some interesting insights into Japanese customs and culture and acting is not bad. All in all, a nice and watchable movie despite its strange casting. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the curiosity of this film. Find out more about real-life characters and an alleged fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston), where Wayne apparently knocked him out !! Based on what I read about Huston and how he got along with the actors, this is an incident that I tend to believe. And it is also a fine example of "diplomacy" by John Wayne.
