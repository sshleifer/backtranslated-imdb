**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize that it is difficult to ruin a historical documentary, but I reveal some of the background and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional documentary not only for the remarkable movie, but also for its history. Since the Naudet did not propose to tell the story of 9/11, but rather that of a novice fireman, the emotions of men and the connection of the spectator with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In a cinematographic sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real script, they would be superb, since the characters were established, so they threw a curve to which they must react. This is all the more surprising considering the pain and excitement of the raw film that the directors had to face to put this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film offers a glimpse of life inside a fire station; in particular, like a novice, he is assimilated to a crew of veterans. That part is pretty good, and if the documentary was allowed to run the intended course, it probably would have been solid. The brothers seem to realistically represent the process of becoming a New York fireman. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell breaks loose. The chaos following the WTC attacks is vividly seen, as various characters we have come to know are driven into terrifying situations. Seeing not only attacks but also first-hand reactions is a very moving image of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> The consequences, in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found, is the human drama at its peak. Life and death hang in the balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but will genuinely care about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that Robert DeNiro's blorts (which I like) were informative, useless and did not advance the story. They were probably added only to attract more television viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: the best documentary I've ever seen. Unparalleled representations of raw human emotions and dramas. 9.5 out of 10.
