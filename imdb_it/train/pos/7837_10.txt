After listening repeatedly to the soundtrack of the CD, I knew I wanted this movie, I got it for Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such a charisma, I can't describe it. I had heard of him that way, but I didn't understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this video. It was incredible. The clips of the Wembley concert are interspersed with surreal sketches like the nuns gorging on a garden party while Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning song titles). George Claydon, the diminutive photographer on the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a driver who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would ruin it, even if I put the spoiler disclaimer on this review, so you should just see it for yourself. Evade the description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious to know Ringo as a director of a rock documentary - 35 years ago - now, finally, I discovered that he has been on DVD for 2 years, but finally he is at my house . It is an extraordinary, even compelling vision experience. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden extras in the double version of the Born To DVD boogie. <br /> <br /> 1. From the menu on the disc one, select the bonus material and go to the extra scenes 2. On the extra goto scene page Scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3. when the cursor disappears hold until the "Star + 1972" logo is displayed 4. Press Enter <br /> <br /> 5. From the main menu of the second disc, select the audio options 6. On the audio options page go to 90/25 (I think well) and hold left 7. When the cursor disappears, hold down right until the "Star + Home video" logo appears. 8. Press Enter
