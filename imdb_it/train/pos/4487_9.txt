"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is good. At least I like it, so I'm surprised the reviews are mixed. <br /> <br /> This is more a macabre story than a fun one, although it has its comedy moments. The atmosphere is dark and ghostly. Suspense is another strong element here. As for humor, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this short, Tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because he talks about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry is looking at everything and can't help but laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner creates a large "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the most terrifying experience of his whole life. Although Jerry scares Tom without a good reason, the way the plot is done ends up being fun. Also, once again, there is no violence here because this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I don't understand that Tom's 9-screw joke was almost sucked into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom discovers that it's all a Jerry scheme and that Jerry made fun of him, Jerry is "caught with his hand in the cookie jar" (deserves to be discovered). Still, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. Watch Jerry angrily for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom doesn't laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a different, unique and extraordinary experience for Tom & Jerry.
