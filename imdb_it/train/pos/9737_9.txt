Exceptional performance by Simon Pegg that gets better and better in every role. As usual he plays the part of a very shrewd character that makes you want to hide it behind the pillow in embarrassment for him sometimes, but this is what Pegg is all about. <br /> <br /> The laughter was regular and blinding and all of them pointed to Penn. The film was very cleverly put together where each character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with Penn that is the only humor involved that is a great merit for director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can't let it go without a quick applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone everywhere. Highly recommended to everyone.
