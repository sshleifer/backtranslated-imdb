This film is about a side of Ireland that Americans normally don't see, the narrow side of religious prejudice of the "world's most friendly race". The film, due to the admission of the Fethard inhabitants, who are old enough to remember the events, is quite accurate (though they insist that the directors have invented some of the most violent scenes just to make the action more spicy). > <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it badly painted the Catholic church, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * have * organized minority vetoes (before the Protestants were Jews). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating vision of the whole question of religion in Ireland
