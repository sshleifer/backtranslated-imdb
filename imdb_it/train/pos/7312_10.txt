It took me a long time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child, I remember that I really enjoyed the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and it took too long to get to the point. I've seen it a couple of times recently and now I know I was wrong. Today I really understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this masterpiece of horror. It is not blood and blood. These are not naked chicks and lame jokes. It's the worst night of Laurie Strode's short life. It's almost the night when his brother demented returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie wants to be scary and I think it succeeds very well. It's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre that I've always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, eerie music and talented young actors, like Jamie Lee Curtis in his first role. Do I have to say anything else? Anyone who has never seen it, horror fans or not, should do its movie tasks right now. Highly recommended!
