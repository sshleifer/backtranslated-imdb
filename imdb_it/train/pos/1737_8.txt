I love the old Burt Reynolds movies. They are more fun and better than any other combined movie. They might even have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess they could have known they wouldn't be good anymore? This movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and walk around in a very racing car, and the lush Loni Anderson is at hand, looking extremely hot in an eighty year old way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I had this magazine that contained Loni Anderson in the advertisement of a vacuum cleaner. I love that ad! Also there is this part of the film where the audience on the track is upset by something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and shows a guy in the audience bending over and sticking a finger on his butt to show his disappointment! I laughed so much that I almost died in the night! If you can find this movie, let's rent it! And then never look at another film again, because I'll tell you right away: it doesn't make sense.
