Kinematically, this film stinks. So it does a lot of acting. But I'm not interested in <br /> <br />. If there is a strong representation of what the 80s were like <br /> <br /> (for many of us in the center anyway) and which is hip-hop, Zulu <br /> nation, and break the dances were really like. Great music, great dance <br /> <br />! It almost seems like a documentary of a time gone by now <br /> <br /> when hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see New York that looks like the zero point of a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that it was a poor and poor city during the 70s and 80s. This is the best of all hip-hop / break <br /> <br /> dance movies released during that time. Of course the 80s are considered a joke now with all the bad TV shows and movies <br /> <br />, but those of us who have lived through it will remember it forever <br /> passionately for a time when music, dance and graffiti were cool, yo!
