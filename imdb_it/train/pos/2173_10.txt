It is often only after years that we can look back and see those stars that are truly stars. Like that French film critic, whose name escapes me, he says: "There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, there is only Louise Brooks"; and there, thank goodness! Louise Brooks! This is the third of his European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film to be one, if not the first, French talkie, for having followed a script written by the famous Ren√© Clair, because according to reports it would be finished (ie, the direction) of Georg Pabst, and for having incorporated voice of Edith Piaf before she was well known! So much talent working on and in a film, how could it not be a masterpiece ?! And this is what this film is. It is a shame that Louise Brooks was a victim of Hollywood when she returned to the United States - so much talent launched so arrogantly by the wayside! In the film, in addition to seeing Louise Brooks in action, it's nice to see the photos of Paris ca. 1930 and to listen to Piaf's young voice. I never get tired of this movie!
