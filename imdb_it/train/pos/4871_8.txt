It takes a Serbian or at least Balkan familiarity to understand and appreciate many of the situations, characters and jokes of "Zavet" and many other Kusturica films. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, nostalgia for the good days of communist rule and the awakening of the young brat look at his nude teacher at the sound of the Soviet anthem. Kusturica not only tries to move away from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films, but creates a whole world of himself in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or an explicit political film in any case. It's a funny movie first of all. Kusturica creates a series of characters we care about. Music plays an active role in this film as in all his other films. His style is direct and grotesque, we now feel that in his characters and we know he wants us to hear the same thing. The space that develops blends present, history and magic, and the colors seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is also not a perfect film. The main flaw is the length, some modifications and shortenings would have been useful, since at some point in time the director seems to have exhausted the ideas and the repetitions presented themselves. It's still one of the most compelling, entertaining and moving films I've seen lately.
