I read an article about Dan Jansen's personal and Olympic journey before seeing this movie. I am always fascinated by a story of hope and the overcoming of life-altering events, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters you are given gives you a sense of family closeness and how they positively influenced the lives of others. I can't talk about the accuracy of specific details in this film, it is customary to take a creative license when organizing a script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is what counts here. <br /> <br /> It is a film worthy of a story that should be told. I felt empathy for the characters and I cheered at the end.
