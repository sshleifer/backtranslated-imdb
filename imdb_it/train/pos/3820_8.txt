This is a story about Shin-ae, who moved to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after her husband's accidental death. Her husband was born here and is opening a piano school, but he also has the ambition to own a land with the insurance money he received from death. If that's the film, it probably would have been like a Hollywood movie, with her falling in love with a local guy and being happy with her son in their new home. But this is not Hollywood. His son is kidnapped and killed, apparently because he knows he has cash. The pain process, the attempts to move forward, the attempts to clear up his guilty conscience, are all done admirably, and the leading actress is superb. The only warning, and it must be said, is that this is a depressing film. You must know that he is entering. You want Shin-ae to go through his pain and find some happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it's Korea and in Korean cinema, especially drama, they don't punch. Life is what happens to you. Great acting, but sometimes a difficult movie to watch, because of what happens. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do that.
