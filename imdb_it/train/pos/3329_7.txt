The only reason I saw this film was for Jimmy Fallon, who had a crush on the 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL. I'm a keen Yankees fan, and I didn't find the painful movie until the last 15 minutes when they started showing clips of ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises, so I shouldn't have heard what shouldn't have been heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. <br /> <br /> I thought that Jimmy played the role very well, because the character had to be nervous and bizarre, and he's a nervous and bizarre type. I know it might not be a Academy Award winning trait, but the film is just a light, fun and romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men. Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and had a much better chemistry on the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career before him, and thank God, because Taxi could have killed him. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone has to stop being so critical of his acting ability because it's just starting out in movies. I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.) you'll see that they left with some flops. Friends of Busom? Australian soap opera? Here he is wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do?
