Although time has revealed how some of the effects have been made this story of love and adventure is still special. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie before, you'll be shocked by what was stolen by later directors. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cashed the movie. They loved the film and had fun thinking it was a touchstone for so many other films and directors. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where a good portion of this film lives, because in the last 15 minutes the film flakes in rhythm. Everything is rushed as if it were suddenly to come to an end. From the starting point of the djinn in the end it seems to be more sketchy and then finished painting. It does not kill the film, but weakens it. <br /> <br /> Still its required visualization for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.
