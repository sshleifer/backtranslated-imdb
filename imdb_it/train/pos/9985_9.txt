I saw this film recently in Winnipeg - appropriate, given the position used. I first read Lawrence's book in the 1970s and for me it has always been a very powerful picture of the evidence of aging in our society. It rang out when I was young, and it resonates even more now. When the movie came out, I was curious to see if the story could survive. and was deeply impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. He can give us a complete human being, even if the character is generally irritable and judicious - someone you wouldn't want to live with. It's nice to see the favorite characters come to life in such an authentic way.
