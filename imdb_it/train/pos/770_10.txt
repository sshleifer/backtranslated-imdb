I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I liked the film so much. Two days before the film's premiere I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the "zmeu" video before the film and I thought I understood everything ... I was wrong: instead of a good movie I witnessed a splendid one! I have FELT the movie. it was sad .. it was fun .. but above all it was written LOVE .. I can't even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so I won't do it :) I'm not a film critic .. I can describe it in several words. My kind is a vague description, all because the comedy left me speechless .. thank God for the keyboard :) Thanks Tudor Giurgiu, thanks Maria Popistasu, thanks to teana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
