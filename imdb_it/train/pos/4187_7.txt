This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is in the early 1950s with the communists trying to steal weapons secrets from the United States government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is the suave unscrupulous pickpocket. It gives a pretty decent performance but there's nothing A-List about him. The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikely anti-hero. It is not very normal. Jean Peters gave a performance as well as the prostitute with the heart of gold. The great leading actress Thelma Ritter shines like the pigeon-stool. <br /> <br /> The plot has had its fair share of twists, jokes and hard talk. There is a scene of struggle towards the end of the film (in the subway station) which was rather gritty and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans (like me) will love this movie. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a little exaggerated.
