Here at IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Gray Owl is the best Pierce Brosnan character ever performed. I don't know if he has had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this was truly exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing - the director's impressive hand. I give my respect The serenity, beauty and spirit of the wild nature have been illustrated in a truly exclusive way, I have never encountered such closeness in any film. <br /> <br /> Another thing that remained in my mind after the film: this is the film closest to the original books and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay tribute to the original Gray Owl.
