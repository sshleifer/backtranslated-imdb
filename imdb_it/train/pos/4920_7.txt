No, not really, but this is really a great movie, and sadly it's a forgotten gem. Black and white adapts to the film. <br /> <br /> Simple formula, a boy had the plague and the authorities have to trace all those he came into contact with before he died. <br /> <br /> Very well directed, and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely overwhelmed by the acting episodes of Paul Douglas as police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as the villains. Unfortunately, Palance played similar characters in some really second-rate gangsters or war movies.
