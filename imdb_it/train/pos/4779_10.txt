On paper, this film would seem incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling in the countryside on a lawnmower certainly doesn't have much appeal, but the real power behind the film is its charm and intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than "The Straight Story". <br /> <br /> The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenager. She is pregnant and is afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about her children a long time ago. He made them take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he made them pack the sticks and try to break them. "That package", he said, "is a family". So many other films would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we are intelligent enough to understand it and leaves us simply to contemplate the thought and draw our conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey through Iowa is full of such a pleasantly non-Hollywood character interactions. Every interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his lawnmower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way through Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene underlines that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. It is a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - for their benefit and ours. It is a slow, simple and relaxing journey that wants to remind us of all that we have lost with the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare live action movie "G" that really should not be missed.
