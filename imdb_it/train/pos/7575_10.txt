Resident Evil: code veronica is a video game very well done, it has fantastic graphics, very comfortable controls, a fantastic plot and a high fun factor. The plot of this is Claire Redfield is brought to an island to cross the Umbrella lands, and awakening chaos is the main laboratory as they search for her brother. Veronica's graphics are very good, fire and rain effects are fantastic. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not fit the Dreamcast control, making it difficult to use to.Its still fun to walk around in some weird eerie place, shooting at the bowels of zombi.Code: veronica also has a little of "Romance" between the two main characters. You can also play Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1. The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, even if I hate the new function, when the giant spiders crawl, they are the feet that emit a disturbing sound and guns sound much more realistic. Great graphics, exceptional history, comfortable and real controls, the stic sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica a true love. I give him a 10 out of 10.
