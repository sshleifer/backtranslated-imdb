We rarely see such short comments written by users of IMDb movies. Maybe it's because this light dark comedy entertains and satisfies without depth, or is there something missing? I would look at him again if I had any incentive. <br /> <br /> So what is randomness? For the French, is Serendipity "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon"? Destiny? Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We've all had these (it's called life) but when you look at it this way, you start to feel that "random" might be more like "faziato". <br /> <br /> A "randomness" in this film could be as small an event as throwing a few leaves of lettuce from the back of a truck or as important as basing an important decision on the life of a stranger throwing a pebble. All these incidents cause other events that ... well, get the picture? Domino. Multiply those of 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you really have to stretch your imagination to accept the remote possibility that this scenario could happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like that. But this is the magical world of cinema. We admit it is fun to watch as the writer / director weaves these independent events into a story that envelops the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for an extravagant getaway, here is the right place to do it. Or if you're recovering from the surgery and you're not going anywhere, this will attract you while your points are healing. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not go down as a prize winner, but should develop a cult following. The strangest things have happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is given the following: "Life can only be understood backwards, but must be lived forward". If you looked at the details in many of your life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident), you would have found a series of seemingly random events that preceded you. <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist with me to explain "Happenstance" to me.
