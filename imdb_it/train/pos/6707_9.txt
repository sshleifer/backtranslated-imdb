I know that sometimes it's really trivial ... But the acting is incredible and Melissa Joan Hart is as nice as a button. I love this show a lot, and I'm almost embarrassed by the fact that I b / c the show has a representative. to be really trivial, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a pretty low budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with it ... As Sabrina's father is of two different types during the film ... I mean, they couldn't say just that he was an uncle or something? However, I can't help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina are a really nice couple and Salem is absolutely fun. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for some light and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season's twists ... Once I get to college, Morgan joins the group and his dialogue is painful and very rude ... In the uglier she is, so the jokes about how she's just surviving with her good looks got lost for me ... But I think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and I was really sad to see one of the my favorite shows canceled!
