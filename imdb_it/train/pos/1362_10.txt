Me and my groovadelic friends 20-something we can't get enough of this amazing Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on DVD, but I can't find it - too bad, because I'm sure the features would be "extra special" !! :) We highly recommend this super cool comic flicker for a date, or even a cozy home by night alone! This would also be the perfect kind of movie to watch with your cat, or even organize a party based on, like a party party party, just like the one in the movie that Parker Posey, lovable, interceptable, unprejudiced, goes to the end . Oh, and you're looking for a gripping surprise ending and HILARIOUS ... put aside, The Sixth Sense, you've just been overtaken by a radder movie! Sorry, no offense, just call it the way it is! Take it from an old movie fan, the comedy is no better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Sincerely, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
