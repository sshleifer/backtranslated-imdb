I didn't actually start watching the show until it came to FX. I was bored and I had nothing to look at and saw that the show's replicas were previewed, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I hadn't seen the show when it first aired on t.v. I loved the show so much! Finally a show for everyone. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were ok shows, but not funny enough. They made stupid jokes and laughed at things that were simply stupid, but not in that 70s show. That show of the 70s was hilarious, intelligent and so real. I think it was the best show ever made and I'm really sorry it's over. Even though I love this show, I think it should have ended in season seven when Eric and Kelso left. The last season was not right, Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character left. I still love this show and I hope the TV starts doing more shows like this.
