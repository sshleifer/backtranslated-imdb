The film trotta van Rosenstrasse is the best film I've ever seen in recent years. actually I'm not very interested in films with historical backgrounds, but with that, my interest in that moment won! <br /> <br /> the only annoying thing about the movie was the scenes in New York and the impression I had I had to "try to be as American as possible" ... which I think has absolutely failed. <br /> <br /> the scenes in the back really hit my heart. German actress katja riemann completely deserved her award. she's one of the most impressive actresses I've ever seen. in the future I will watch more of his films. good luck for me as I'm a native German speaker =) and only for a year in us, so as soon as I get back I'll buy some riemann dvds. <br /> <br /> so everyone out there who hasn't seen this movie yet: WATCH !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is yet, in particular all the flashbacks and interruptions of the times are difficult to explain, but simply watcxh, you will be zesty !!!!!!!
