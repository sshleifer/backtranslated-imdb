I saw this movie on Sky Cinema not long ago .. I have to admit, it was a really good western that has two big names. On one side is Charlton Heston, who plays the infamous and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. On the other hand .. The late James Coburn who plays the evil Zach Provo .. who seeks revenge on Burgade, no matter what the cost ..! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was that there were some really good characters. Most of the actors played very well .. Especially James Coburn, which I find was really bad in this movie .. But as it was .. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, which I saw everywhere in other films .. I played Hal Brickman .. I heard his character was left out in the cold, but he manages to get back in with Burgade, to take down the Provo group! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great movie .. Very nice to see .. Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> Wonderful piece of western person ..! 8 out of 10.
