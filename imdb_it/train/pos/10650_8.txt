I rented this movie last weekend, increased the surround sound system and got exceptional sound with special effects. This film is a great movie for rent, special affections where it's enough to scare my boyfriend, but I noticed that some were surprisingly computer generated. I didn't go to the cinema and I saw this, but it's scary at night and I don't feel like going to the movies. I would recommend it!
