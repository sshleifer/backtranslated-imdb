This is a type of film that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very beautiful. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will grow a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film is very different from most films. In a sense you are not satisfied, but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only reasonable end was the ending shown in the film. Otherwise, it would have been a grave injustice for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness who meets a girl waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and ends up being helped by the witness. Slowly, slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is not clear if he has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for complete details. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I can't wait to see more films from him. Soha is pretty but didn't talk much in the movie. His eyes, his innocence did most of the talking.
