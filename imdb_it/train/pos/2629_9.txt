I wasn't sure when I heard about this coming out. I was thinking about how stupid Disney is. I was wrong. I found it very good. I mean, it's not The Lion King, but it's nice to see another side from a certain point. It was very funny. Also, it wasn't one of those successful sequels that the animation sucked, it was just like the animation of The Lion King. The only thing that set me up was the whole history of cinema through the film. Don't give anything, but you'll know what I'm talking about. I also enjoy the fact that it was nice to have most of the original cast to return. It was a good film about everything.
