I never thought about it this way, but my friend said that the first thing he thought when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was gay porn. At that point, all I had known was the reference to it made in that "Seinfeld" episode with Jerry trying to take Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer was all sick and bleeding from his nose. <br /> <br /> The film was grandiose and surprisingly optimistic and not all the pretentious and pessimistic pessimists like some films that I can't even remember because they are all disgusting. <br /> <br /> The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck in New York trying to do the bully (a male prostitute, in practice), thinking that it will be easy to collect, just to hit the brick wall when a woman ends up shoving it, loading it for their sexual encounter. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "Ratso" by everyone and by the friendly gay boys who make fun of him all the time. You consider him a scoundrel, but a lovable one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the film is so sweet and moving that it looks to be more friendly and so and so. Rizzo turns out to be really a sad man, pitiful, very sick, very depressed and awkward, who hates being called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems solved, and he will learn to be a chef and be famous there. <br /> <br /> It's hot to see Joe doing everything he does to bring them both to Florida, along with many hilarious moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party and get caught by the woman who says "Damn, well, you know, it's free. You don't have to steal it "and say" Well, if it's free, then I'm not stealing "" and that classic, completely unwritten and unscheduled moment where Hoffman is almost hit by that Taxi, and shouts "Hey , I'm walking here! I'm walking here! "), and the acting is so believable, you would never have believed that Joe Buck would grow up to become the illustrious and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would become the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman. It's not the first time they've worked together in leading roles, but the chemistry is so dense and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there's the sad part that I think is rather an exaggeration to call it "depressing ". Ratso Rizzo is falling apart throughout the film, he succeeds barely walking, barely eating, coughing a lot, he is ill and reaches a landmark on the bus to Florida. He's sick badly, and only a few miles from Miami, he eventually dies on the bus. The bus driver reassures everyone that there is nothing wrong with it and continues. Sad, but not in the way I would make you go home and cry and shudder miserably as if you had just lost your 13 year old dog. <br /> <br /> All in all, great movie. And the soundtrack consists almost exactly in "Everybody's Talking" "played throughout the film at appropriate moments. A strange but fantastic move, given that the song is good and fits perfectly with the tone of the film. Go see it, it's great , go buy it
