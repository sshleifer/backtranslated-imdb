........... as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; the reason for this is that we read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were TERRIFICATE when the Woman in Black enters from the window and floats on Kidd's bed, even though, just before there is something that has also frightened us, which it happened when Kidd found the toy soldier under his pillow, and heard the voice of a child say "It's for you". That scene still haunts me today, almost 7 years after seeing the film. <br /> <br /> If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
