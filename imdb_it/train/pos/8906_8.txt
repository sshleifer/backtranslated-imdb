Some of those guys who watch movies and complain about them for a living forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you the people, I saw the main screen repeat in this about 35 times. It was amazing. A cinematic tapestry of cascading splendor that made me where it was, which was the beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I was hooked. Again and again and again. And beyond. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And this is just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I am put back in bed, curled up with my Vaio. Rain is in the flat roof and soft again tonight. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that crosses me is already rested. I joined the DVD. I was mesmerized in the night. "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> The Blob. Watch it. Steve Queen, two cops and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
