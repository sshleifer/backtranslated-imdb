This type of film about young teenagers struggling with their sexuality was something unique, bold and daring a couple of years ago, but more and more films like this have been made in recent years, making it difficult for films to really stand out yet. <br /> <br /> This film also received little publicity, apart from the usual small film festivals that have characterized this little French film, as well as the big festivals that are always fond of this type of small films about everyday subjects that they are not handled too often in films. The film was presented at Cannes in 2007 and also won some awards. <br /> <br /> The film does not stand out much from the others, since it is actually not very new once you have already seen some similar films like this but this does not mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is a bad one what to watch. The film is certainly a good watch, which manages its subject well and tells its story in a constant and therefore also effective way, in a typical slow French cinematic rhythm. <br /> <br /> It is a training film by age, focused on the lives of mainly 3 completely different teenagers. Sexuality is an important theme in the film, which is managed in a delicate and subtle way. It makes the film and its history as a whole quite realistic, although perhaps a little predictable, since the film offers nothing quite original in its genre. <br /> <br /> This type of French film will probably scare many people for the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty, with deep layers and meanings. However, "Naissance des pieuvres" is a very accessible film for everyone and you don't really have to be involved in Euro-teen films to appreciate this film. It is a sweet and somewhat sensual film, thanks to its subject and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also made realistic by its actors, who have not had and have much experience in the film business but are authentic and feel in their roles. The strong individual characters provide the film with some nice themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie on the subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
