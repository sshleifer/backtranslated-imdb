This is not the funniest movie I've ever seen. Beginning with the four delinquents who are sent by their fathers to the Wienberg Military Academy, a tone is set that continues constantly throughout this goofball movie, and doesn't give up a second. <br /> <br /> It is hard to try to describe this film; the humorous elements are so clear and brilliantly thought that at first glance it looks like nothing more than a stupid comedy of lust from the 80s. But it's much more! Fresh from the minds of those people at MAD Magazine, Up the Academy offers a formula and a style that I've never seen duplicated by any of Hollywood's "funniest" offers in the past. Basically the film is so full of childish cornball material that one could assume that the writers were also a couple of fourteen year olds. Watch this movie if you love acting "immature". A classic. *****
