I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time when it was released in England in 1980. I liked it and after having just taken it in August 2005 on a Canadian station it is still excellent. The only thing I regret is that I can't find the soundtrack or the DVD in the shops ?? ... nobody cares about shedding some light or I have to order it from some expensive internet company. But back to the film, music stands the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about 1980s Britain. It was actually the same decade that I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons that one was "Thatcher" and what he was doing to the country at the time. Please, if you have the chance to watch this movie, you will not regret it!
