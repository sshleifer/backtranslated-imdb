TACHIGUI: THE INCREDIBLE LIVING OF FAST-FOOD SUPERVISIONS Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii With: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera - - ------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Way back in 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashed his fantastic animated film Ghost In The Shell, which helped consolidate the international acceptance of anime - and he also dug into the overall concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the film, Innocence (2004 was the first Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and let your head spin so much for its style and effects as innovative as for its often unfathomable plot. <br /> <br /> Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui: The incredible lives of fast food counterfeiters that has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor Japanese anime for this. <br /> <br /> Greet Oshii's "superlivemation" creation: not really animation, nor exactly live-action, but the cast resisted somewhere near 30,000 snapshots , which have been digitally processed and reconstituted in a way of cutting out the deceptively simple paper that reminds us of Balinese puppets.The movement itself is a stylized, stop-motion style that echoes the experimental sequences of Tetsuo by Shinya Tsukamoto: Iron Man (1988) . <br /> <br /> "I couldn't think of any method other than this," Oshii said in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animations." <br /> <br /> The choice of cast is equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic, while Studio Ghibli's renowned producer Toshio Suzuki spends his time on screen to be murdered in a bizarre way. Others include Katsuya Terada, who dabbled with Oshii in Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects wizard who worked on Godzilla films. <br /> <br /> The narrative of Koichi Yamadera sounds like a dry NHK documentary ?? which belies the undertone of the comic, as does Yamadera's vast career, which expresses characters from stoic souls like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a bizarre retelling of post-World War II Japan in the context of various fast-food off-shoots - from soba ramen shops to gyudon standing bars; American dogs in the heated trays of grocery stores in restaurants with hamburger chains inspired by McDonalds. "Food is a primordial root of desire," said Oshii, by way of explanation. <br /> <br /> Thrown in the mix are a new generation of consumers: the fast food gilters of the title, people who don't like to pay for their tucker and constantly tune their elaborate scams to score free munchies. <br /> <br /> Has Oshii said that his further reason was a tribute to the "art" of eating food on the streets ?? something is still considered a bit taboo in this country, and that goes some way to explaining the use of the "tachograph" in the title. <br /> <br /> The director of action films (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as the animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two media. The result of celluloid here is deposited somewhere in the gray area between both formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it is irritating. Just don't ask what it really means; Oshii's films, which are equal cerebral and innovative parts, are often not particularly clear. Where does Oshii go through a liberal dose of black humor ?? here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, the death of hula-hoop, the world's fastest burger samurai chef ?? and in the true nature of the surrealism of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a man who submits to the influence of directors like Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps owes both to Andrei Tarkovsky and to David Lynch. So it should not be surprising that at one point a B-52 bomber flies over a Yoshinoya-like franchise. The 53-year-old writer and director seemed to think this natural. "The Japan that I painted in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> of Andrez Bergen
