This is truly one of the best love films I've ever seen. Followed by none other than "Before Sunset", which technically is not at all another film, given that it is the same two people and the same love story. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. OK, this is only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the protagonists of the film. Reading the other reviews, I'm glad to know how many other people are crazy about dialog based movies. And that's what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and fun. It's no surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, "because you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to call their best friends, with the others who pretend to be best friends. It's perfect. It takes you back the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I must say that if you have a choice, look "Before the 'alba "before watching" Before sunset "". If like me, you have looked at "Sunset" before, it is difficult to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers during the whole show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting, excellent script and beautiful locations. Young love, at best.
