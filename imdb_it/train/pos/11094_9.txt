This fluid and gritty film offers constantly. It is one of Frankenheimer's best and undervalued films and is without doubt the best adaptation of Elmore Leonard to date (and if you're scratching your head thinking "but I loved GET SHORTY" you have to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the "feeling" of Leonard's characters better than that of John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The transfer of history from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the sloppiness factor of history to incredible levels. Be a man, eat a couple of beers and watch this movie. For reference, my favorite books of Leonard are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a very special place in my cold heart, movies for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
