I haven't seen him in over 20 years but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This film could NOT have been made in color. Gray grays are what make it, and was life really so simple in the 50s ?? What stands out most in my memory is Perry Smith who goes to the gallows. His breath under the hood just before triggering the trap. I don't think I can see it again ... once it's abundant. It is like that nameless boy at the beginning of "Papillon" who is dragged away in the guillotine. The guy who said he was watching this on a double account with "Dead Man Walking" should have added the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live". <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors are "aristos" at the guillotine in 1794-95 so my feelings on the death penalty are quite intense.
