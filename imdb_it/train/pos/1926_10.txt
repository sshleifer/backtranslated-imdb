In 1967 I visited the glider port of Lake Elsinore and piloted a yellow Pratt Read glider. Returning to Germany, the serious service reported above was broadcast on TV and one segment involved high-altitude high-altitude flights in California in the early 1950s. (The real pilot of life was Bill Ivans, I don't know who played him in the series.) It turned out that the glider in the film was the same (the same N-number) as I had flown in Lake Elsinore. Since I saw that segment I was looking for it and wondered if it was available somewhere. (other segments of the serious one concerned the Baker Ejection Seat, a tool to find avalanche victims etc.
