After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally ends up in an invisible ink bottle, which was part of a chemistry set. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so predictable results occur, which means he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often has a sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible, even if not provoked. <br /> <br /> Here, it makes Tom believe that his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes, or milk from a plate. Tom can't take it anymore, so try to sleep out of that nightmare, but Jerry sets his paw on fire! Friend, I hope that little children haven't had ideas to watch these cartoons in the 40s and 50s! I always found Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, any damage a character suffers has disappeared in a few seconds and returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this comic is about two-thirds of the way Tom understands what the story with Jerry is and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is (like putting flour on the floor for see his footprints).
