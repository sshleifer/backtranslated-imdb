It's very, very funny. You know, just like a comedy should be. It also looks very nice, as a Hollywood show should do. So what do you want more? Howz on a VERY good Sally Fields. It's much better here than in anything else I've ever seen, and it looks so damn good. This film is all you need to understand why it is a star. Those eyes! Like a silent but better movie star. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I pretended to be a bad television actor with my girlfriend. We will do that thing that you look very fast from one eye to another of your partner. They don't do it at all in the soap dish. Great. The eyes have it! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many formidable performances, it's fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. There is a whole ongoing workshop with Kevin Kline on how Overact very subtly. I got it? Yes, it's damn good. So is Robert Downey, Jr. who has since made Slick's career, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and compelling, especially when she's angry. And also Whoopi Goldberg is decent, its natural timing gives here some Zing flat delivery. OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I heard you. <br /> <br /> And then, there's the Hair. Soap Dish was made at the end of BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous doos is like a great character in itself. They become bigger and more foolish, just like yours. Yes, we have photos. <br /> <br /> Soap Dish is better than I thought, better I wanted it to be. I'm sick of the films that tell me that I should care about superficial, egocentric and semi-talented egocentrics, for example. TV soap actors. Soap Dish seems happy just to make me laugh. Thank you.
