A film to see absolutely for anyone who has ever gone to the field or wanted it. This film captures the absolute essence of what is the summer camp. It's fun, it's compassionate, it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits start acting. If you haven't seen this movie ... what are you doing? come down and call the video store. Have a good summer :)
