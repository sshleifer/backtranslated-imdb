I thought it was a fantastic film for children aged 6 to 12 years. A bit mushy, but the story is raising a new one. It shows that a teenager's dreams can really come true. I think it's a good story for every child who is down in the dumps, or feels like he's trying to juggle too many things. Very nice movie Bravo.
