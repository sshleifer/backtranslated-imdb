I don't know the stars, or modern Chinese music for teenagers - but I know a very funny movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it's played to laugh, out of love, and it's a great blend of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> It seems everyone has had a great time doing it - the production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks more lucid than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school just to be kicked out and then discover the superstar as a basketball game (and love and more etc.) is fantastic - this is cool, fun and immensely fun. <br /> <br /> With great action and good dialogue, this is simply fun - for all ages - and for our money it was one of the best family films we've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we were really glad we did - a good sports comedy movie.
