I realize that this review will suck at the film critics who patrol this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The dentist is actually a really good movie. The acting is not always first rate, but the chills are good and the story is good. Also see Linda Hoffman's tits. Not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction looks good and the plot makes sense. Corbin is a great terrifying dentist. Dentists do what Jaws does to sharks ... ish. Obviously he had a fairly limited budget, but they did well with what they could, and they developed the characters well (the ones that matter). <br /> at the end.
