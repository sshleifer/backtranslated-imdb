I would not dare to say that this film is better than the original, but it is very good in its own right. The comedy in this film is just as good as the original, there are so many scenes that make me laugh just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The story of this film is even more bizarre than the original, but this is what makes it so exceptional. Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with an exceptional cast. The main cast of the original film returns to their characters in this film and they all do a fantastic job with their roles. I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrait of Ted in both of these films, like I did with Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin return to the role of Rufus, very beautiful! Hal London Jr, who plays Ted Logan's father, does a great job. The scene where Ted has his father's body and Hal London Jr starts acting like Ted is a fantastic scene, and he pulls it off in an impressive way. I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the film for me. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the first episode of the series Bill and Ted, then I hope you will like this movie too. But don't expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you like the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
