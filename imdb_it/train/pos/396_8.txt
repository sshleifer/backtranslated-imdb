Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriors 18 years ago. Over a Christmas, in a rare week in which Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong films, Zu Warriors was so compelling for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it was recorded in the memory of the now grown up sprog ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the first movies I saw as a kid that I can clearly remember the plot and action scenes of. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their first classic. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension. Could you beat the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or will you follow the path of other remakes and die a more horrible death than the bad guys and their broken neck that you find in those kung fu movies? <br /> <br /> Well, the answer is that I can't say. But this is because this is not really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Zu tells the story of King Sky, a lone warrior, whose teacher, Dawn, declares his love for him but his life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn reincarnates as Enigma and Insomnia is back to destroy Zu. Meanwhile White Eyebrows and Red try, with the help of King Sky, to stop Insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists, but it contains enough details to get me interested. But I can see this movie as one you love or hate. The film talks a lot about special effects, most of which involve different computer-generated environments, much like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this film was one that didn't go overboard with the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. Nothing seems rushed - unlike Hero. The backgrounds were complementary to acting and not quite overwhelming the scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a lot of characters and the intertwining of so many people makes the film intriguing. He was probably on the verge of "too many cooks", but generally every character had his part in the story. But some of the roles seem to be "extended cameos" in my opinion, and somehow I'm left to doubt slightly about the need for this. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo have a very central role in the film, but I could not say that this film showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have matured at least in her acting, but is still quite raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me. Despite his very short role, I apologize and admit to opening my eyes! <br /> <br /> Overall, I must say, I enjoyed this film as much as I liked the original. Since both films are made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle that shows how Hong Kong's film production has changed in two decades. And a beauty of this is the fact that you can't really compare the two films, as much as apples are apples and pears are pears. <br /> <br /> After all, both are nice movies right. And I go back to remember remembering the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to look at, but don't compare.
