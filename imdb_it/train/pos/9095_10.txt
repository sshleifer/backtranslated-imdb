A fascinating and entertaining film that gets a solid rating all around. I saw a screener of this movie recently at work. It was so nice to see this movie in contrast to all the hideous horror movies I see every day. So much so that I thought of writing. I'm not sure if this movie will go to theaters, but I hope it does. It's a good movie to watch with friends, it's a charmer and has some funny jokes. The acting was terrific (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. The direction was pretty good (not a film that had to be over-directed). What really makes this film stand out is the script, I think it was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish and the jokes between the characters are smart and have a good rhythm.As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice those things! (I'm an idiot.) Anyway, a really nice film that I recommend.
