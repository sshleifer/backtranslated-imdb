What was there in 1939 that helped produce so many excellent Hollywood films? Well, whatever it was, magic could also be found in this image of Columbia. It's a comedy to fuck long forgotten by Turner Classic Movies. (Maltin's movie book does not contain it.) In almost all departments, Amazing Mr. Williams is a gem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his planned. While the wedding bells are about to ring, he is called to the scene of a murder. The woman in question must learn the hard way not only to enjoy the hunt for criminals but to belong to the police. There are lots of laughs in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas demonstrated once again that he had few colleagues in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are fun. <br /> <br /> The film lasts a little too long, but who cares? Screwball comedies are always able to entertain, and this movie belongs right there with the best.
