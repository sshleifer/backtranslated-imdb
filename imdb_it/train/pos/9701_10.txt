A fantastic show and an unrealized classic; The League of Gentlemen remains one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times. <br /> <br /> With a dark and bizarre humorous style that dominates the tired and formidable approach of his lower successor, but unfortunately much more recognized, Little Britain, The League of Gentlemen was really something special during a it was pretty quiet in British comedy. <br /> <br /> Until the scene, there had never been anything like The League of Gentlemen before. Apparently, a seemingly simplistic sketch, the show soon unfolds as a vivid, sinister but incredibly fun universe populated by all sorts of brilliant comic creations. What distinguishes the show from its rivals is the approach to tell us its story. Rather than serving bound sketches, barely distinguishable from others, here we see each individual or group of characters crossing their various paths and plots. No visit to them is the same, and each time they offer us a surprise. <br /> <br /> Gradually, over three series and a Christmas special, the imaginary city of Royston Vasey is still a very grotesque hilarious population. And this is probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch (and also why the show would easily deserve more series') Unlike other shows in progress like The Catherine Tate Show or more important Little Britain, the League knows when a character has raced, of course, and has the opportunity to face it. Many of the favorite fans, who may have been easily entertained to further entertain, bowed before the series closed, giving space to other characters to grow more, or allow the introduction of new Royston Vasey residents to make their mark . <br /> <br /> Another thing that defines this show above the others is that the writing team approaches the screenwriting process with care and intelligence. As mentioned above, all four members of the league have a healthy mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations, and when it's time to call it stops with respect to certain characters. This awareness has also meant that the Gentile League undergoes a brave evolution, which is usually not seen in a spectacle of this nature. The third series, driven by narration, and much more obscure, is a brave step compared to the first two series based on the sketches and this brave move of the League really pays off. With the third series, there is less urgency for them to please an audience, and like the Christmas special, they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative, unlike the more pattern-based previous series that (successfully) combined together various series of sketches in a narrative arc of a series. <br /> <br /> The third series is both a refreshing change of style rhythm, and a real surprise for fans who have already seen the first two. Despite some opinions polarized on the third series, any true Lega fan will appreciate what the third series has to offer, as well as really appreciate the more character-based episodes, which only delve into fan favorites, but couple and interact with wine characters that may not have crossed before. <br /> <br /> It may take a while to try to get into the change of style, but it's definitely worth it, and in my opinion, the third series is the best and also provides a definitive conclusion to the series. <br /> <br /> The show is not without its disadvantages, and occasionally certain characters and scenographic pieces appear somewhat out of place, but for the most part, the genius of the writing, the dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters (which are often too close to real life) create a real treat and show what comedy should be and puts most of the most recent, moving and often desperate attempts at comedy into shame
