I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent and had a good story. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an X-5 escape, creating manticore, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still "save the world". And be hunted by the manticora for the whole season which gives the series some more spice. <br /> <br /> The second season has suddenly become a bit strange compared to the first one. The plot has disappeared, and the series has lost some of its charm, mainly due to all the strange "creatures" that appear. Don't get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a little more for the "manticores". However, they managed to return to a promising new plot in the final episodes of season 2, in which I had many hopes of seeing more of them. <br /> <br /> So I'd really like them to be able to start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind this he can't go wrong. So, as a conclusion, I'd say it's a great series, but I still hope for a third season!
