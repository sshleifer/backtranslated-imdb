When "Good Times" was first introduced in 1974, it was one of the first black family sitcoms. It focused on the poor Chicago-based Evans family and their struggles for results. Most of the early episodes focused on the parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide for the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were terrifying actors and had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. he was the teenage son who chases the skirt, but well-intentioned, which made up for his lack of subtlety with artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive and brilliant girl who continually traded insults with J.J. Michael was a child prodigy who was well educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a huge mistake by shooting at John Amos, literally killing his character. This has really changed the focus, and not for the sake I could add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon behavior that angered the black spectators and the star of the series Esther Rolle, who left after next season. Instead of a show focused on the main African-American problems that existed in society at that time, viewers had shows overloaded with chases and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> Once Esther Rolle was left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Even though it was still watchable, it was no longer the great show of the past. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became evident that the show was in its final stages. All the free parts were tied during that season and the show slowly faded away. <br /> <br /> First three season: A. Last three seasons: C +.
