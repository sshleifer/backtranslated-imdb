"The Man In The Moon" is a pretty good movie. Sometimes it's very touching and it's very well done in all respects. I wouldn't say the film was terribly original, but what is it these days? <br /> <br /> The cast members have done a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a good job. Jason London also does a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked the character of Sam (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seemed to be the kind of father you fear, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very nice. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about how to grow and how to deal with what life throws at you, then you should watch this movie. I'd suggest reading the synopsis of the plot and if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, then go get it. Anyway, I hope you like the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
