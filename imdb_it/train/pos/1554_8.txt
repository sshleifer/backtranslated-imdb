I saw it at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks for the first time with yellow hyperprotein. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with disquieting protective suits. Experienced British soldiers wear gas masks (only) and once again await the gas clouds and the German attackers. The clouds of gas are getting closer and closer, finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans advance slowly threateningly in their fearful guise. Suddenly a scream from the defenders ... This gas is like no other that they have experienced before .... <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still Brivid, I think you will also you!
