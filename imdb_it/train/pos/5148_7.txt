I don't know what it is with these films. But films about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Obviously it is not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate films nowadays, even when the "experts" disagree with each other. So I prefer to judge a film by what it is trying to say rather than choosing all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years passed too quickly. The series should have been a three-part story, his childhood was the first part. But if they didn't have more money to shoot more stories who am I to criticize him ??? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem I have with this movie and this is the fact that it is told in a story way of the book. Especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. I'd rather see Hitler more human (more scenes in which he doubts, etc.). Noah Taylor has done more in the movie "Max", which seems to work better, I think. However I'm glad it was done and owns it on DVD. Just to remember more vividly what happened and to see Carlyle give her best. 7.5 / 10
