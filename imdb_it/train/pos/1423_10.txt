You have to see it to believe it! The directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something really exceptional, it's a 10 out of 10 so I can't believe that the other user of this site has voted so poor, unless they expected to see only a normal movie, with people, love scenes and so on. I am also convinced that this type of documentary is an excellent way to wake up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with the documentary film by Al Gore "An inconvenient truth" made mainly of long monologues, painfully and with "truth" not always accurate, as many scientists have already indicated. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not the lack of the Earth.
