It made me wish my happy birds could talk. Tisk got the reviewer who denied the film right. A sweet story that people of all ages will appreciate. Paulie is a lovable little treasure. It has some clever lines that really made me laugh. I particularly enjoyed the dance sequences during his showbiz period. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you cheer him up in his search for reunion with Marie. A fascinating film with two strong characters who make friends with the little parrot separated from its young owner. I would have liked to see more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey. I liked his artistic and poetic inspirations, a pity he couldn't share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally with Marie, perhaps joined by the friendly young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.
