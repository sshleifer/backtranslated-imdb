I imagine this film will only work on people who have all been excluded from the gigantic clamor of Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. And so I love this movie. Above all, I like all those impeccable LotR superheroes who are so perfectly and disrespectfully parodic. The most brilliant thing is Gandalf's counterpart (the brave and wise and completely humorless magician): Almghandi, cowardice and the dead cerebral transvestite. Sauron's counterpart ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) wears a simple bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorn's alter ego is another accident-prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ("Ulrike" the legend) with scotch. And "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's counterpart) actually bears a strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
