I have just watched this film again and am amazed by the number of cynics who dismiss it as the only New Age father. A great film, one that takes the time to develop, that continues to approach the limits, but never does and in the end is meditative, influential and more faithful to life than most films that ignore its "coincidences" can see. At the time I was angry because films like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked the latter) were nominated for best film that year (not to mention the fact that "Silence of the Lambs" won! ) And this was completely ignored except for one nomination for best screenplay. After revisiting it, I think the story supports my initial reaction!
