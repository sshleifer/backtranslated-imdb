Rob Roy is an undervalued epic of passion and action! SOME MILD SPOILERS INSIDE. Liam Neeson gives an impressive performance like Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best of his career. Jessica Lange is literally perfect as his wife Mary. They have the greatest passion and the same chemistry I've seen in a couple of screens. John Hurt gives his the best aristocratic performance. Tim Roth plays one of the great villains of the screen. His rape of Mary is repugnant and heartbreaking. He is truly a magnificent bastard in this film. best swordsmen ever. marked by scripts and the direction of Michael Caton-Jones is impeccable. 10 out of 10.
