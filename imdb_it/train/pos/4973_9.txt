I remember watching this original broadcast in 1962 as a child of five or six and really enjoying it. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since then, aired on "Walt Disney Presents" on Disney Channel. I had forgotten most of it, and some were aimed at children, but it was still pleasant. I can't wait to show it to my niece and my nephews.
