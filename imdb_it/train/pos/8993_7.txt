Rock n 'roll is a messy business and DiG! he demonstrates it with mastery. A project of great ambition, and perhaps of stubbornness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of sequences around two groups of bulky rock. That being said, the abundance of quality material guarantees the film's ability to capture the public. If you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this film will undoubtedly be a compelling vision. the music in the film, even if it suffers in the slightest from cutting and pasting needed, is worth the price of admission alone. the next morning I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to get a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I had already started the Dandy Warhols sounds). Primarily defined by his exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other deep levels. To dig! it is a sincere and sufficiently objective gaze on the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and on the people who try to deceive those forces.
