Che: The first part was a fascinating experiment, which not only told a very interesting story, but also tried to do something different with the "biopic" genre. The second part is the excellent result of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the same attributes from the first, from the extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant direction of Steven Soderbergh, without forgetting his intention to break with the conventional biopic rules. what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they always succeed most of the time. <br /> <br /> The final message of this film is perfect and includes everything we have been told about the life of Che Guervara. The only failure I found on Che: Part Two is that some parts seemed a bit irrelevant to me. In summary, I give Che: the second part a very enthusiastic recommendation because, like the first, it is a brave and fascinating experiment that challenges the viewer and lets us think.
