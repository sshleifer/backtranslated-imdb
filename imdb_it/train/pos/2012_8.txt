This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and some fun pieces. Every time I laugh at Millie, the waitress who pretends to be a debtor, who holds her delicious handkerchief while she is chatting, and polishing the furniture with disrespectfulness while she is chatting. I can never get past his French accent without being a problem trying to pass it off as the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> Seeing a teenager Mel Torme and the very young song of Frank Sinatra is a real pleasure. My mother saw Frank Sinatra in a theater around the same time that this film was released. He said they couldn't cancel the "bobby-soxers" in the movies (in those days you didn't have to go between the screenings). This film shows how attractive and young the young Frank was and allows you to appreciate even his first talents. And Victor Borge lets in some of his routine, which is an advantage. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet and simple storyline. Very pleasant.
