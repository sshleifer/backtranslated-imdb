"My Left Foot" is a rather impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist paralyzed by cerebral palsy and who learned to paint with her left foot, the only limb in her body she was in control of. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Academy Award for Best Actor for this film, which I am not absolutely sure was deserved, but it is still noteworthy. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and sometimes almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and moving role. My problem with this film is that sometimes it's a little too real. When Brown is in despair and has to help someone and do everything with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This gives it an often depressing feeling that it can turn off some viewers for a while. However, if you look further, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those with disabilities and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still consider themselves to be problems are inspired by this film, because if in some way we can overcome their difficulties with a much worse condition than we can, we can certainly do the same thing. Well done, sometimes fun, but hard to watch. It may not be for everyone, but not for nothing. <br /> <br /> *** up ****
