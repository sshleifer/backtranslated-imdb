It's hard to imagine that this film is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to make the miracle happen is so exciting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he made to create this disabled character. Watching it on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is quite brilliant and intriguing. Christy is not scorned by the normal, her life is also colorful and delicious, although we can be aware of loneliness and painful blockage through her eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor in Christy's success is the support of his mother that seems to be more touching, and unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Academy Award for this role, this fat little woman of middle age uses everything to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christy, what a show for a child! Christy's love story is very well done, confident. Christy wants love and nothing can come from the right to love, her crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, by the disgusting Aunt Petunia, so his appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, every woman has her youth ...) she is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a double-edged sword, happiness and the agony is right next to each other. <br /> <br /> Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH O DIE Trying ', god knows why he chose to direct that shit! Really a career spot for him, what a pity!
