This German documentary, in English, is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film we see him taking sections of icicles and "gluing" them together with a little humidity in a serpentine form that seems to pass repeatedly through a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, the icicles melt, but that transience is a part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and has the feeling, intuitively deciding what to do that day. He talks about having a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials he works with, trying to work * with * rather than against them. It could be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. The sculpture could last for minutes or years, or it might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed. Work seems to be more a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> The film and the work are beautiful, stimulating and stimulating. It moves rather slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you should be sure to go when you sleep well at night. But go if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the web for other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find out what this movie means to you in a completely independent way. I remember a couple of ideas that came to my mind while watching the movie I thought I was sharing for those you still read. First, the transient nature of much of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live and in the end we die. It's natural, and of course it's also part of the Goldsworthy art. The other thought was amazed by the way Goldsworthy managed to integrate his passion and his work so completely into his life. Most of us have jobs that are tolerated at best, a life that we hardly notice that we live, and passions that we really want to spend more time on, if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has succeeded in creating an amalgamation of all these aspects of his life that seems to work very well and feeds him and those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Seen on 28/08/2002.
