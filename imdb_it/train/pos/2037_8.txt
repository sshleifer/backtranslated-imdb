Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his horror debut "Creep". "Creep", even if a little loose on information, proves worthy of a true bloody classic. A little less polished than the recent US horrors (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake) this dark and gruesome story follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the maze of underground tunnels and disused railways like her, and a number of others along the way, try to escape a murderous aggressor. Although some negative reviews have predicted this film, I truly believe that with a tight budget and a British production of the first director Smith, "Creep" really lives up to its name. Provides a frenetic chronic action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast because the plot is fragmented in some areas, but with a perfect position and the best reaction of the character in the end that I saw in an instant "Creep" offers some scenes that are definitely stuff for nightmares.
