"Stanley and Iris" is a film that warms the hearts of two people who get together and help each other overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widow with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. He decides to teach Stanley how to read at home in his spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he does a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him. <br /> <br /> It is a really beautiful film without nudity, violence or obscenity, which is rare in today's films. A nice film in the round. <br /> <br />
