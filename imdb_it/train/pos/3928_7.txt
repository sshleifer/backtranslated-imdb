Of course it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was so weak. And the portrait of Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was nothing but a loon. You mean to tell me that Lincoln was a clever and intelligent donkey with no respect for the law or the court. I mean who the hell it was? Cousin vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll call you Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford was going for a great funny hero, but I didn't like this guy at all. He betrays in sport, talks like a real simpleton and doesn't seem to know if he sits in a courtroom. How should I take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The twist was even weaker. I mean, come on! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed thought of by a 5-year-old girl in her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was a lot of fun and made me laugh on several occasions, so I can't say it's a bad movie. In fact I have to say that I have to say that it is quite good, nothing that amuses me and makes me laugh can be bad, but this vivid and silly story was so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it fantastic. > <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this film was, but if anyone were true I would really need to shake my head.
