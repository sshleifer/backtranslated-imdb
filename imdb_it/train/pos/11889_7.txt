The low-life melodrama, well done but fundamentally dark, which, according to the accompanying interview with Isabelle Huppert, the writer / director Pialat infused a good deal of autobiographical details; given the mostly obnoxious characters involved, it doesn't pay him any compliments - and he seems to have been a tormented man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days and days during filming! <br /> <br /> Acting is uniformly excellent, however; Despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (like the title character!) Were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status that, with varying degrees of success, is still valid today. <br /> <br /> I have 3 more Pialat films in my "VHS To Watch" stack, although all in French without English subtitles; for this fact, but also for the oppressive realism of LOULOU - despite its unquestionable artistic merit - I cannot say that I am in a hurry to see them now ...
