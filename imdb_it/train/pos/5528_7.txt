This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is almost no dialogue in it, apart from the narration; and the landscape and the music complement each other perfectly. In the beginning I didn't connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was indicated to me by a friend (who also has red hair!) It is almost an old type of children's film, saying that the children today they prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc., but I feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature that this film certainly does. Perhaps it is not the best film of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing vision for all ages, not just for children.
