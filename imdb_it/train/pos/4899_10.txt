I'm so glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for happy films and this turned out to be a real gem. I loved the fact that the film, a kind of love story, did not concern the beautiful twenties; rather, it is a story of some handsome sixties, who used to be in their twenties. It is a good story, well written and wonderfully performed with the fabulous music of the Second World War band. It also has a delicious surprise for Scottish castle lovers. He left me smiling and ready to look at him again, which I did a couple more times before handing him over. I highly recommend it.
