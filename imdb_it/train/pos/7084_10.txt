I can't decide if this is one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller and has an emotional core, but I still can't decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first Terry Gilliam movie I saw. My first impression? I was engaged until the end and it is not that complex (to be confused). <br /> <br /> The film is set in the future. A James Cole man (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to get some information from the past (1996 to be precise). A virus has killed 5 billion people. It is sent from the future to get some information about it. Also involved here are a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly. The love story is beautifully portrayed and you can really feel the desire for this love and desire for a normal life. The endings are tied in a very interesting way at the end. <br /> <br /> One thing that I liked about this film is that unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not prefer to give any boring social comment and instead focused on this guy and his desire for a normal life. "You want to see the ocean, being with her" is above all a touching line in this film. He chooses to focus on tension and confusion in the mind of the person. So this isn't exactly a post apocalyptic movie, but it could be described as a romantic science fiction movie with themes ranging from time travel to blurry realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie from the 90s. The complex plot flows without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> Performance is pretty good. Bruce willis surprised me here because he didn't play the usual hard, but he gave a good interpretation of a confused man who is in love. His desperation in certain sequences is beautifully portrayed. I have to take a look at his other films. The beautiful Madeleine Stowe is a real show to watch. Since I saw this movie, I've become so obsessed with her. He gave a great interpretation of a woman who sympathizes with his patient and eventually falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise though with his portrait of a madman named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar-nominated performance is quite surprising considering he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him. <br /> <br /> The end is rather chilling and this is also another reason to watch the film. Length or complexity is not a big problem because this film is fast enough and there are enough accidents to keep people interested. And every episode of this film has a meaning and there is nothing that is not necessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
