I saw this film for the first time 3 years ago, and it was presented by Disney's Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, he returned to TV, and this time I recorded it. Since then, I must have watched it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspirational, beautiful film, intelligently written and credibly interpreted by all concerned. Resists any sentimental make-up in the book, as well as all other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see a film in which children are not jerks and have a lot of behavioral problems and athletes are not depicted as muscular testosterone heads. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood has gone another extreme to what they call "gritty realism", making films in which everyone swears, and has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not attempt to exaggerate sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I've seen it since the late 1970s, and it's so undervalued. <br /> <br /> But this film has excellent performances from ALL, and congratulations to the writers. <br /> <br /> A gem in the film is near the end when Jim is practicing on the bench before the big game, and his wife calls him from the stands. He rushes and reaches his family. The look on the faces of the other three pitchers sitting on the bench on the bench is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change of pace, then resume this movie.
