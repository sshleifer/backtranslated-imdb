The last film in the Lucas saga is a sumptuous and spectacular-looking production. He is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it's a notch above episode IV (and only a notch below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best film in the saga in 6 parts. As for me, it's still a great movie. It is not a film with a beginning, a climax and an end; the mechanism of the film works with one goal in his mind: to bring closure to the universe of Lucas. There is an air of finiteness combined with everything that makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Besides, it's a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and the old ones face unexpected new challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) a great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic couple, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is the inner conflict of Luke (and Vader) that gives the saga its backbone. Lucas' aggressive imagination is still very evident, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope and redemption resonate strongly. I'm glad that in the end Lucas abandoned the idea of ​​making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend for a long, fascinating and captivating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinee style.
