John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone bank employee who lives in a small town not far from London. Despite the Internet, contact a Russian brides agency. She chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman the boy could be lonely and shy, but he certainly tastes good, doesn't he?) And when they meet, he realizes that she doesn't speak English. The communication between them is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the boy, you only have a little eccentric sex with Nicole Kidman!). On his birthday, two of his Russian friends visit them. So, many surprises will happen. I liked this movie: first, it's almost impossible to be "labeled". Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller? I believe all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is beautiful as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: are you speaking in Russian with a correct accent, or just pretending? Anyway, I found a funny movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
