Friend, I loved this movie! This really brings me back to when I was a child. Those were the days when the teachers were still showing classroom films on reels and, if I were good, they would slowly rewind the film so they could look back. I still remember one of the opening lines ... "Tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan, he lived with his sister like that and so in the village." This is a great film for children and lasting like the red balloon. Eventually the other Indian boys of the village attack the pens to Tutazema and he himself becomes an eagle. He lives the way he always wanted. Reaches the sky.
