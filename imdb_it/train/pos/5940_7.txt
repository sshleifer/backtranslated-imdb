this short film trailer basically talks about Superman and Batman working together and forming an uncomfortable alliance. Obviously, the two characters have very different opinions on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment is a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along. I won't go into the plot here. But I'll go into acting, which is terrifying. All are actors. The two actors who play Superman and Batman adapt well to their characters. The same filmmakers I did Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made this short film. Of the three, I probably liked this less, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the most beautiful World's is a 7/10
