In the previews, "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" boasts the image of another wave of immature sex on a 40-year-old Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he didn't. Too many negative past experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point of completely avoiding women. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. Also, there's a movie about it, and it's called "The 40 Year-old Virgin". <br /> <br /> The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is actually 40 years old, works as an employee in an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are shown throughout the his handsome bachelor for all to see. He has a nice home theater system and looks at "Survivor" with his two kind elderly neighbors. It's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy that needs to get out more and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now here's the real novelty with this image: it makes the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject in a nice and mature way. This is a film that could easily be very different in the hands of a more transparent filmmaking team. It could have come down in endless gags and sexual jokes, but fortunately this picture never folds so low. Of course there are sexual jokes here and there and even some prods are aimed at the gay community (which in no way are meant to be taken as bluster), while two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while they play a video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception", no less - the last testosterone-driven fight test for boys). <br /> <br /> As someone who quickly approaches 20, collects the action characters of McFarlane Toys and never did the act, I found this film funny and moving in a way that a movie with a similar theme it could never be. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone else in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this show; all the others seemed to have passed all the 40 years. A bit arrogant, I know, but you ("you" are in italics) can still relate if you were the only girl present at an afternoon screening of "The 40 Year-Old" Virgin "? <br /> <br /> Andy obviously never had sex and wakes up every day with "morning laugh" (don't ask), and he is under pressure from his friends to try out extravagant methods to attract the attention of the opposite sex. Andy is a virgin at 40, her three friends and fellow colleagues from the electronics store David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) at first believe he is gay because he has never been with a woman, who could not be further from the truth.The truth is that Andy loves women, but the traumatic experiences of the past (revealed hilarious one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him aside for ever. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal embark on a mission to put Andy down, so help them all. that these escapades will end in disaster, as shown by a date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), which puts Andy in the worst drunk driving experience, I think no one would like to pass and has a rather disturbing encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the beautiful girl who works in the bookstore and who eventually turns out to be a total sex demon. <br /> <br /> Things get better for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works in a shop across the street selling things on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with that nice collection of action figures, you can understand that in the end he expects a big financial gain, that is, if he can ever "do the deed". <br /> <br /> Finally, this is the sexual fun we were waiting for. This is a very real problem that many Lonely Guys probably face, not that something is wrong in being a virgin, but let's look at the big picture: how many of us "Lonely Guys" want to be a lonely boy forever? The important thing we are taught in this photo is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he needs to go through body waxing like Andy (who is apart from splitting to be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was actually real, as was the blood on Carell's shirt later). <br /> <br /> "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by himself and Carell, who was born as a skit that starred in Carell. Carell is sweet and human, since his character is not a paratrooper who approaches this thing with his eyes closed. This is probably one of the smartest romps I've ever seen and it's not offensive (a lot) because his characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's friends, who pass bad advice to cover their relational insecurities, can be linked to a fundamental level. <br /> <br /> The way "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" plays is really fun in the end, but I'll leave you, the viewer, to watch. Surely, if someone manages to go through the things Andy does and still has the strength to attract a sexy woman like Catherine Keener, then it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
