"Moonstruck" is a film that I liked the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the second time. I loved it for the third time. Now it's one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> Humor is subtle but really good. The film offers a lot of humorous warmth. the story takes place in an old-school Italian neighborhood in New York. The search for Cher's love is pleasant to look at. This film is, by far, the best work that Nicholas Cage has done on the film. The character of the old man is fantastic. Turn on the screen without saying a word. The scene with his moon howling dogs was fantastic. But, perhaps, the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The culmination of the film is a scene in which the protagonists leave for an oatmeal breakfast in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and conclusion.
