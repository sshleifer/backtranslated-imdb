While Urban Cowboy did not exude the same testosterone that can be found in a rodeo, he provided an accurate view of that day and age in urban Texas. I also think that to really criticize this film, we must have lived in the time and place where it was created. There was good music, fun times and, yes, a little "rough and tumble" in the honky tonk roadhouses. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, as "two ships passing in the night", was well conceived. When Pam tore up the note Sissy had written to Bud, she echoed the tragedy of many real life stories. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the screen was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
