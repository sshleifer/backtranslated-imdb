When I was 17, my high school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is not a big surprise, since it is perfect material for high school and reputed to be the most dramatized musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a student music and kept strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a persistent disregard for the version of Dick Van Dyke's film that had (deliberately) obscured Elvis's references and set him up for a swinging public of the 60s. <br /> <br /> So when the 1995 version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was entranced by what I saw. Alexander turns into an exceptional performance like Albert, a performance in stark contrast to his best-known character on a certain television series. The rest of the cast is fun and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who doesn't seem like her part, presumably a naive and innocent student). <br /> <br /> But above all, the musical the familiar numbers of the theatrical performance are all preserved in this film and performed as should be the musical pieces of the scene (taking into account the absence of a stage). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check this telemovie. The show shows justice in a way that probably can't be improved, which is good enough for me. What could be better than making a writer's work faithfully and with colors and style?
