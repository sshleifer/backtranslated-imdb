Modern, original, romantic history. <br /> <br /> Very nice acting of both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a good job imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also as good as the shy, boring employee. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very understanding. I forgot what a wonderful woman she is. It is not difficult to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected turns in history are good for suspense. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the film was rather a surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: nice movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
