In celebration of Earth Day, Disney released the movie "Earth". Stopping away from any strident message of darkness and ruin, we are treated to some excellent shots of animals in their habitat without feeling too bad for ourselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and her calf. The narration begins at the North Pole and proceeds southwards until it reaches the tropics, while the inhabitants of the various climatic zones crossed are presented. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned as we see the wanderings of the polar bear; it is noted that the islands of sea ice are shrinking in more recent years. We never see the bears capturing any seal, but the desperate search for his father's food leads him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> Aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra are one of the most spectacular shots of wildlife I have ever saw; this and another of wild bird migration is enough to reward the admission price to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I have heard is that otherwise terrifying shots of great white sharks carrying slow motion seals have been shot. You never have the sense of a characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the film to convey great speed I think it started with (or at least it's the first I remember seeing) the TV show "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting side view is that while the credits come out during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques used are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this film to make it a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of a selective editing (which saved us, so to speak, from the macabre end of a predator-prey moment) and the fact that this video was released in 2007 and is available on DVD is a solid film in its own right standing. And you can bring your children! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
