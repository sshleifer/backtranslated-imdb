There are a few really fun science fiction movies, but this will make you unconscious. The Martian's Jack Nicholson takeoff is a side crack. The plot has a very clever twist that has been seen to be enjoyed. This is a film with a heart and excellent acting by everyone. Make popcorn and enjoy a fantastic evening.
