The Old Mill Pond is more a tribute to the African American entertainers of the 1930s than to any denigration of the whole race (despite the caricature of Stepin Fetchit). In addition to the ones I just mentioned, there are also versions of Rana Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This cartoon by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising's Happy Harmonies is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around. They all look very similar to the reality that half of me thinks it can be. Otherwise, they are certainly very flattering imitations. Even the lazy and unobstructed fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when being chased by a tiger while "Hold That Tiger" plays on the score. Highly recommended for animation lovers of the 30s and jazz music.
