this movie takes you inside itself in the first few minutes and keeps you until the end. it has a very human history and excellent selected music. The acting of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfying. Recommended for people who get bored of action movies and want to see a good movie.
