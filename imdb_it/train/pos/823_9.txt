Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which ended definitively in 2005, I have always considered this 1983 film as my favorite movie of the long-lasting series. The various action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, wild and wooded creatures, etc.) have made this film particularly attractive. <br /> <br /> None of the actions has ever focused too long at one point. The last half hour exemplifies it more when the scene changes every few minutes from the woods to the battle between the spaceships and the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another nice feature of this film if that of the two previous ones had not been the absence of fights between two of the stars. Gone are the incessant squabbles between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. In the end, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure, more than anything else.
