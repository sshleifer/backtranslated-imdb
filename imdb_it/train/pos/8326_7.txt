While "I.Q." by Fred Schepisi does not really have important qualities, it is still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously some of the film is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It is not intended for anything other than a light comedy, unlike the more famous 1994 Robbins movie (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's entire life should focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activism, which is how he wrote a letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (he got to the point in which the FBI kept a file on him). <br /> <br /> So, however, this is acceptable. Also played by Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
