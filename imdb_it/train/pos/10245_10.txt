this was one of my favorites when I was young, it had everything that was nice with 90s children's movies ... adorable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain, and some great songs (and not the typical mermaid / beauty and the beast-like songs, but the ones that are fun too)! I met this movie again recently and I love it even more than ever! I advise everyone of all ages to see this film, and I certainly think it should be presented to the new generation! sorry not the most informative, I'm in a hurry ... just please, trust me. everyone who goes against this movie is killing their inner child!
