I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain his virtues to the uninitiated, but for now let me quote some of the pieces of the extraordinary dialogue, which, please, remember, is all ironic. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else - well? <br /> <br /> (lyric song title) "he can sink a beer, he can choose a queer, in his latest double-breasted Bondi outfit." <Br /> <br /> (another lyric song) "All pommies are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is the e-hole of the universe." <br /> <br /> (during a television interview on an "art program"): Mr Mackenzie, which artists have impressed you the most since you were in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin's bull artists! <br /> <br /> (while chatting with a naive young girl) Mr. Mackenzie, do you suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I've never seen an Abo in my life. Mom makes most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) around our place. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this Aussie movie. If you can get a copy, look and have fun.
