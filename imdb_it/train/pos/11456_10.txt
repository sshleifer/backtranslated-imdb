Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist master of the first order, who expresses the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. In fact, time and change are what your work is fundamentally based on. I bought his first book several years ago and my family wondered about it many times. So it was a pleasure to meet the artist personally through this film, he is just as patient and kind as you'd expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which is expressed in his occasional inability to put it into words . It's like most children who play alone outdoors (if they do anymore), creating things from sticks, sand, mud and snow before they get too big. Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and mission of extending that kind of game to create profound visions of nature and to open our eyes often fatigued in new and ingenious ways. And always with the utmost respect, the gratitude and humor of a wandering monk amazed.
