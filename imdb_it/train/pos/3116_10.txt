The last episode of the action thriller series is the one that probably was the hardest of the three films. It goes beyond playing on the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he's doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits him on the nail from cinematography to the choreography / acrobatics to the script up to the acting. <br /> <br /> The film starts in a whirlwind as Bourne is running away from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first movie left off. Or does it? The weather is a bit confusing here, but we have the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean up makes him almost capture, but he does and doesn't kill anyone. They are not his goal. From there we get more intrigue than his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back and so is Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a past with Bourne. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is looking you in the face following practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if it seems possible compared to those of the first two. And the veteran cast who chases Bourne is superb with a beautiful part of Albert Finney. It also has a slight political tone in dealing with renditions and other government policies, but this is minor and very well integrated within the plot. All in all this is the best of the conclusions of this year's trilogy, if not the best action trilogy ever.
