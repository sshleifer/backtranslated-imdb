Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most amazing and delightful film I've seen throughout the year. This is a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where inmates have tried and played a different Shakespearean show every year for the last 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn wonderful things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. The truth is really stranger than fiction: if someone tried to adapt this story to a fiction film, the public would never have bought it, but knowing that it is real makes the film breathtaking - literally; I gaped when I heard about a crime of a particularly gifted criminal. It's like an episode of Oz, and all the more fun because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
