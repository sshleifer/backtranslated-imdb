I saw the second half of this movie about a year ago and I was very happy to find it finally available on DVD. Recently, I saw many of the PBS reality series on breeding, etc. None of them has been so close to telling the story as this film does. Based on REAL reality, without blinking, sad, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in the first frontier life. The fine acting by Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell are added to a well-made script. The opening credit states that it was done through funds provided through the National Endowment for the Humanities. If this is the type of product taxes I could go I would be happy to see more. I highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you saw it and enjoyed the movie.
