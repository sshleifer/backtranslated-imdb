The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason for seeing this film. Because it never became a bigger store it may never be known. But it is exceptional and steals every scene in which it is found. Garson Kanin directed this piece of soft toy and the cast is top notch, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro particularly memorable. A "9" on "10."
