This movie made me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw a lot of fantastic movies, even more crap. But when the scene ended - he fell into his core - I Cried came! And if you didn't, you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it's real - because that kind of thing really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything they experienced in the early 70s ... At one point this led me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never works really well. But this film really made me believe that all this ... Because they don't try to make it a path full of glorious concerts, present musicians who are superheroes, groupie girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, don't glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that reaches even 20 years late ... Once again a great film. From "Leaving Las Vegas" I have never been so touched by a movie.
