I saw this film on cable for the first time about 5 years ago and I couldn't stop laughing. Everything about this film seemed to click, the plot, the characters, the setting. As for the film, I wouldn't call it a great movie, but for what it is supposed to be, it's fantastic. It has meaning. The cast is perhaps as good as any other ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are fun. That's why I haven't seen it, I'll give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank robbery. However, when their friend is arrested by two policemen chasing him from New Jersey, they try to understand what is happening and all hell breaks loose. The film is really a great comedy about the caper bank and is a bit like a poor version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all, if I like to laugh, I strongly encourage you to watch this movie.
