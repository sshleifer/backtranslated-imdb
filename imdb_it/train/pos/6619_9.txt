Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), <br /> <br /> City of lost children (augmented senses or anything used and abused and above all, well, just giving us much less than we could dream of), and <br /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> These should be added. <br /> <br /> For a while, I was waiting for an animated film that could influence me as much as Miyazaki's stuff. This is the first one. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of this. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly love, right? But there are so many totally submerged sci-fi and noir themes in this film that it's just a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> These people have done an incredible job!
