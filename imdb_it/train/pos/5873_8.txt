This would have been a safe fire classic if they had chosen ANY OTHER ELEMENTS for John Abraham. This guy is a horrible actor. Whether it's comedy, drama, tear, etc. Stink. It seems that at one point Priyadarshan also understood this, and practically blew it around like a monkey to make his solo scenes a bit funny. <br /> <br /> It is the only obvious disadvantage (there are couple more annoying little pieces) than a ABSOLUTELY hilarious movie otherwise. The best comedy in Bollywood from Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it is a situational comedy carried out by a brilliant script and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. He'd better wear shoes for the best comedian in any awards ceremony. AK has always been good at comedy, but takes him to a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and the way it delivers each line. It's a brilliant performance. The crowded theater was going crazy for almost the entire duration of the film and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala no have a heroine "protagonist". She is the star of 3 incredibly HOT + Beautiful girls that I thought they did a good job. Sure enough, they're all making their debut. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, even if his routine runs out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self (sick of his exaggerated action in every film). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's more fun than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. It would have been even better if they had chosen someone more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
