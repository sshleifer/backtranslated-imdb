This film is essentially shot on a camera held by actors in it. In some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video journal by killer is full due to a "Columbine" style attack. Although this film does not answer all the big questions, it gives you an idea of ​​how easy it would be to get by. The film shows how the actors illegally shortened projectile guns, made a pipe and devised an action plan for "Zero Day". The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, obviously they borrowed their lives heavily, but at no time did I discover them really playing (Something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was brilliant, but I'm not sure we needed the last scene. Overall, however, a really nice movie on a very difficult subject.
