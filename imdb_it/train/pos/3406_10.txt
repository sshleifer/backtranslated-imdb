In terms of visual beauty this film is exceptional! I had no idea that Technicolor was released so soon. Although I didn't like the ending, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me want to be in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big advantage and, of course, she is so charming and I loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not overcome the scenery and the scenery ... The hotel, the palms, the desert, that's all ... the legionaries also bring a "Beau Geste" feeling to the film. They certainly don't make films like these anymore. Don't miss watching this classic!
