The original Cindy by Jessica Alba Max and Valerie Rae Miller shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality varies a lot from one episode to another, but in general the standard is high and, when it's not, it's always worth looking at Jessica. Valerie's African-American urban jivetalking is almost dragging Dark Angel into the sitcom's territory.
