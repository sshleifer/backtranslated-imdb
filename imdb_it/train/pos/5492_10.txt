I was impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for some time, but it wasn't until I saw the film at the international documentary festival in Amsterdam that I realize what he's really achieved. This film tells the story of the coup / conspiracy by the Venezuelan elite, the oil companies and corrupt Western governments and oil lovers, to remove the democratically elected president Chavez and bring Venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship. This film is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and it is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I express my praise to the people of Venezuela for taking the matter into their own hands and saving their country from people like Halliburton and the Bush regime.
