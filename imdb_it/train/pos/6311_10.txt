This film is a lot of fun, and has a great compilation of actors like William H. Macy who have always played this kind of role, perhaps its most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney who is an excellent actor who shows his comedian in the Cohen brothers' movie "Oh brother, where are you?" which turns out to be one of my favorite movies of all time! But it was difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood" here in Mexico. My city lacks good places to buy good films. I tried to buy it at Blockbuster but they don't know it with the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find out if I have the name they gave it in Mexico, does anyone know?, Because I can Remember! Greetings. A.
