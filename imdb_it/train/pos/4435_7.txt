This is a small crime drama that encompasses much in its 65-minute duration. It has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his novice Tobin (John Miles), a dark runaway killer and also the love interest for the Tobin in the form of a female botany Mary (Patricia Wright) who helps solve the crime. There is also a terrifying final shoot-out set in a cemetery yard. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a fantastic goof near the beginning of this film in which Lieutenant Corrigan refers to the dead woman as "Tatooed Tilly" 'BEFORE the coroner reveals he had a tattoo (confused eh?) . Even later, when Tobin chases the killer through the back yards, he suddenly sees himself going in the wrong direction - no wonder he didn't catch it!
