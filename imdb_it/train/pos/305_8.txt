Screwball comedy on romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his photo - he venerates them - yet Audrey Hepburn has (of course) placed a notch above the others because, after all, it is Princess Bogdanovich who probably fell in love with cinema 30 years earlier. He shoots her in affectionate close-ups, slips into the sheets between her and Ben Gazzara wonderfully firm and a little hard-boiled, and lets his room shine everywhere. The love connections made during the film are fast and fun, even though I got tired of John Ritter's TV-style ease. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen, sensual and sensual land, are all worth seeing. But it's really Hepburn's Valentine's Day and she's absolutely blinding. *** from ****
