I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really liked this movie. I had a lot more fun than I did with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's fun to hear people challenge this movie with excuses like "lame storyline" and "it's much rougher than show". Does anyone remember the harshness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy has incest bars and Bo says that Luke probably raised half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason it has been cleaned up is because it has been changed to earlier times. <br /> <br /> And as for the plot. It was the perfect plot of the Dukes. In fact, as a remake, it probably remains more faithful to the source material of any TV program migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. But I wasn't too excited about Burt's Boss Hogg. And I wish I had a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a bit ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who hasn't had a smile while General Lee runs the streets of Atlanta and the back streets of Hazzard? <Folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't regret it. It's just a big stupid movie!
