I have to admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected it to be the kind of All American Propaganda we don't love so much in Europe. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, indeed, it is barely political. <br /> <br /> Describes the events of September 11th through the eyes of firefighters called to the scene immediately after the aircraft crashed. It's an incredible coinidence that this documentary was filmed at all! This film was initially shot as a documentary about a New York firefighter who became "a man". We can only thank the directors who continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them. <br /> <br /> A great job. Absolutely amazing material Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Greetings,
