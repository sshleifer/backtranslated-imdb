This is not just one of Jackie Chan's greatest films, but also one of the greatest kung-fu films of all time. We expect crazy acrobatics and a fast and creative action in Chan film, and this has set the benchmark for others to follow. They are two hours of pure fun, which really impresses. <br /> <br /> In addition to the superb action, we have a feasible storyline and believable characters, with Chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to writing, mixing the methods of eastern resolution (ie kick ass ). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's fun, serious, fun and innovative. A must for every kung-fu fan, while remaining accessible to the broader sectors of the film community.
