I loved the episode but it seems to me that there should have been a quick reference to the secretary who was punished for actually being complicit after the fact. While I like it when an episode of Columbo has an unpredictable turn like this, his resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the discovery of the murderer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comments about being flattered by the famous Lt. Columbo, making an ironic allusion to the detective's true life as a crime solver. This is one of the best routes from Columbo.
