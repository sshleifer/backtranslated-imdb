One of the first OAVs ("original video animation") I've ever bought, this has yet to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set on an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) background of near future pollution in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> Dominion's "heroes" are the tank police, formed with a "if we can't beat crime, we will get bigger weapons" philosophy, and who they are, as the name suggests, patrol the cities in tanks instead of patrol cars, and which are actually far more dangerous than any criminal are trying to take. Most, if not all, of these policemen are borderline psychopaths and neurotics (?), Giving new meaning to the expression "loose cannons". <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and amusing are their opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his hench (wo) men, the Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to imply the hard task of the tank police. <br /> <br /> Animation is not state of the art, but it is very beautiful otherwise; the colorful palette and the cartoonistic aspect of the characters and the mecha adapt well to the comic atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is still a lot of fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of this ... <br /> <br /> However, Dominion Tank Police is fantastic. It's a Japanese cyberpunk SF with a lot of comedy, full of characters and completely exaggerated situations, to make sure it never gets serious. Highly recommended.
