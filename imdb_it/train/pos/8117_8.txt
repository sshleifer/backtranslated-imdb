I saw this film for the first time 40 years ago on the television of N.Y, and I thought it was a depressing look for the future. Wells believes that restricting private freedoms is a good thing. ("no private planes".) The war of over 30 years in the film was the reason why this film was not shown to British film-goers who make war. The concept of the future and the concept of Korda an Co. of the machines of the future are the real protagonists of the film. The best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson in the role of the Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina of the comic series Absolutely Fabulous. It is interesting to note that the negative personality of the Boss is somewhat similar to the Churchill wartime.
