I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to the last minute. It is brilliantly shot, with many interesting shooting angles and original techniques. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is chosen by friends and colleagues alike. He hires an assistant at work, with his real intention of finding love. He is an ex-prisoner and she takes advantage of him to take revenge on those who hurt her. In return, she must help him with a robbery that requires his lip-reading skills to get him out. The film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of really excellent scenes and an even better ending. The real beauty of this film derives from the way the director relies on the disability of the protagonist. The use of sound keeps the tension constant, and the dramatic change from silence to noise keeps the blood pumped, that's for sure. Throw some black comedy and nuances of erotic sexual repression, you have the makings of a great movie. It's the kind of movie that Hollywood really wants to do, but it just can't.
