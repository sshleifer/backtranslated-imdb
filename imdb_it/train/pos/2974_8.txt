This movie has an excellent rhythm, you never have to wait for a belly laugh for more than a minute and there's a lot more to it than the movie's initial premise. In all this we are mocked of the traditional schmaltzy genre-made-good-done-overcoming-adversity mentioned in these parodies. Don't let anyone tell you they're trying to get cheap laughs using only obscenities; - of course, there are many but it's all contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so in terms of entertainment value, it was the best movie I saw this year.
