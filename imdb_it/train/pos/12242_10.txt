I consider this film a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, so I realized how great a film it was. First, it describes a face of World War II that we usually don't see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are shown to be more "humanized". One of the facts that struck me most was the mention, at the end of the film, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20 years ... that forest is the place where the last chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those it's the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who love details is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they go through a door or a door is opened. Many ports are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, in their actions, etc. Every time it happens. Have you noticed?
