......... and get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Don't get me wrong, this film is much less explicit (or even) than Pretty Woman, but (was) a new topic for Bollywood. The topic has been accepted but is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. To tell you the truth, the topic is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has the number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is presented in a very "filmi" way. There are small holes in the plot. The film resumes when Rani has her spontaneous abortion where you feel you're watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise the whole family sequence felt exaggerated in the beginning. The acting could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes disappoints you. Here he gave one of the best performances. Furthermore, his role is so well written that he applauds every time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the film, you feel more suited to his character, but it is obscured by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is perfect for the image. Of the three, he gives everyone a run for their money. It's amazing how convincing it can be when he's innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your girlfriend next door. This role is one of the reasons why I consider it high. The supporting cast is like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but I found them tolerable here. The songs are very beautiful. The title song is my favorite of all along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the world view) are two songs that fit perfectly into the film. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been shortened while Punjabi no. 1 came across boring although he had a good dance. Otherwise the film definitely deserves a watch.
