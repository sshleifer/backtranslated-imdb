Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and all the other actors and actresses of "Men of Honor" have come together to make this film excellent. Mark Isham wrote the filmcore, so you know that the music is really good too. <br /> <br /> But: after noticing a handful of goofs, loopholes and extravagant distractions of heart strings from the beginning, I had to make a vow to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do it, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a true hero, is stimulating enough to last a lifetime. Watch it on the internet ... The whole story is more surprising than the movie, as the director admits in his comments. There were only three African American divers from the US Navy in World War II. However, nobody has reached the status of US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American American scuba diver sailor. And he was the first scuba diver ever to be certified or re-certified as a diver by the US Navy. (Resounding applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the film's ledger: should I just tell you about one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing "spoiler" and we will do it ... The initial, crucial scene in which the helicopter hits the radio shaft and sinks into the sea: they would never have had time to adapt to the complete Mark V sub , even if it was the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to be alone "... a couple of minutes late" saving the pilot. <br /> <br /> So, for loopholes, tricks, and overdramatization, I derided "Men of Honor" from a perfect 10 up to a 7. <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood DOES NOT ever realize that Is the pure truth much better than their too dramatic approach to the story? I doubt it. Sin!
