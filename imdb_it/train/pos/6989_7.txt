This film appeared in a very early episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I don't think about that wonderful TV series. I think this was a surprisingly good horror movie from the 1940s, with a surprisingly good sound and image for a 67-year-old public domain horror film. I really enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who needs fluid from the glands of young wishing brides, an old witch and her two bizarre children, one a giant idiot, the other a dwarf comedian Rossitto since 1932 of Freaks). I also liked the young female reporter, which is kind of a stereotype, but it's still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise dignified film is the plot, even ridiculous and incredible for a film. I don't want to spoil this movie, so get out and rent it, or better yet, buy it for a couple of dollars.
