If you are a fan of Air type movies this is a must see! Set in the 1920s and 1930s, Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors but great lines. "break down the data wall, break down the data wall and cut down data # @ $% # @ $ wall". "You shouldn't hang me on a johnny hook" or "Looks like Johnnys is getting ready". It's definitely a parody of the old James Cagney Movies and it refers to them a lot. There is a great scene when Jhonnys walks on death row and has a priest set up for his escape. Listen carefully to the readings of the false priests, it is rather amusing. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Look at his reaction to Johnny after he informed the Pope, he said so much without making a sound. I recommend this film to all those who love to laugh or are old movie fans.
