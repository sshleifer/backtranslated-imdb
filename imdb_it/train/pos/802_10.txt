I know I know it was a good ending but honestly it was great. I love it when a movie ends in a terrifying dark nature, but this time I was impressed that Darth Vader turned against the Emperor. I was really amazed. The distressing sequence in that film was when Luke was tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A beautiful sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the ships of the ships of the rebel battle and of all the imperial warships and super-star destroyers. I loved the new breed that the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the honest (the Lando pilot) and many others brought to the screen ... Most of my favorite scenes are in that movie: 1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is mortally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia kills Jabba by strangling the crime lord Hutt. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the script and the battle of Endor which features a land and space fight and the best Star Wars duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Postscript: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.
