Easily 9 out of 10 for a film as a director we will continue to grow to admire it. But don't watch this movie expecting to be "entertained". Ang Lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the film, like all Lee's films, is that it does not "flank" its characters. Create characters, embody them with life, problems and ambiguity ... and endow them with a reality that often strikes much closer to home than that of which many feel at ease. This film has action, but it is not for the action lover because violence is deeply disturbing and far from free ... that is, like the characters, it is real. And as one would expect from one of humanity's most terrifying wars, violence is horrible. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of the greatest human ambiguity that surely lived in the Civil War, it is a masterpiece. Was the war on slavery and abolitionism? Lee seems willing to blur that line made so popular in representations like blue and gray. Nor is it about idealism, however, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It is about freedom, the desire to have something that is yours and to fight for it. As you watch the characters, you wonder "how can they fight to preserve slavery?" The fact is that I don't think it really is, and because the film shows the problem of why so many have been caught in the vortex of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn are fighting for the sense of loyalty to the "home", even though they may never have examined what the house represents or if they really marry its values . The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty that extend to the limits. And when the tension finally starts, and these characters suddenly find themselves "free" ... we see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> All this mixed with Lee's beautiful incorporation of the world of humanity with breathtaking views and looms. Lee has a style that is his own, somehow European in his "art" (a slow, no-frills camera), an Asian in his epic poem and the development of history, yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in North America . /> <br /> Relax, let go of your preconceptions about what the Civil War is, what the "western" as a genre, what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you on a world so fragile, so difficult, so real that few of us can see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he beat in Ice Storm. Once again, the film is slow and with no apparent "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to direct without "imposing" himself on history or on screen. His direction is amplified by what brings out from Jewel (yes, the singer), an untried actress who stages an extraordinary performance. <br /> <br /> A film for those who love cinema and don't like the epic Hollywood standard.
