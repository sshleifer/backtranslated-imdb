Very well done and spooky horror film from the PRC film company of poverty, which usually delivers tacky movies like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. German expat director Wisbar works wonders on a tight budget and his set of studio swamps. Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton is as effective as the Strangolatore.
