I remember seeing him as a child in the United Kingdom, mesmerized by the story and narrative of Laurence Olivier. The next day we don't talk about anything else at school. I guess the ratings for the first screening were huge. This is simply the best, most complete documentary series despite the fact that they had to cut the story down to the marrow they managed to capture so much. What is interesting is that the battles of Great Britain and North Africa have been fundamental, but they are largely not recognized as such by the Americans. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, the mistreatment of Japanese prisoners of war by American troops. The images of the Holocaust made me, a non-Jewish European, feel perpetually guilty about the treatment of the Jewish people. I don't know why this is not the number one on IMDb charts. Perhaps they are showing their prejudice against documentaries. Spoiler - we'll win.
