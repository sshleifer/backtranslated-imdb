In the voice on which the film begins, Hughie (Billy Connolly), a roadie for the great 1970s band Strange Fruit, said that the reason lightning struck a rock festival to stop the Strange Fruit set was that God he was tired of the 70s. In fact, it was popular to put down that era of music, and see punk as a welcome antidote to it. While I agree, the excess was tiring (as well as the misogynistic impulses that came out of it), and like punk, I'm still a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock, and this film is long and Strange Fruit's strange meeting is an affectionate tribute to those days. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons the film works is the care of people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson directed WHAT IS LOVE TO DO, on Tina Turner (while I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was very well managed), screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais wrote the COMMITMENTS the British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW and the songs of Strange Fruit were written together by Mick Jones (which should not be confused with The Clash's Mick Jones) by Foreigner, so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. Furthermore, two cast members are full-fledged musicians (Bill Nye knows nothing about it, although the film credits him with his own singing, and he certainly looks like a singer from that period, while Jimmy Nail was in another English TV series music-oriented, even though I forgot the name and he was in EVITA, and the others are convincing, and while, as I said, many bands from the 70s like Strange Fruit behaved badly with women, the film does not commit the same mistake (except the woman who follows Timothy Spall around); as meeting manager, Juliet Aubrey is pretty good and plays a well-rounded character. <br /> <br /> The other actors are all good too, with a special praise to Stephen Rea, who handles the most dramatic role well without sentimentality. There are a couple of points of the plot that don't work, but overall this is pretty funny. Oh yes, and the music is good too.
