"Maybe we can arrange a meeting." "Where are you now?" "I'm sitting in my office." "I doubt it." "Why would you doubt it?" "If you were in your office now we would have had this conversation face to face." <br /> <br /> Bourne remains as tough as the road, and elusive. Only his inhuman capacity for recovery brings the film a little too far into the imagination. The conversation is macho, to the point with only fragments of the Bond type to humor. It's about action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that there is something going on at another level in the world we live in is what the trilogy hatches so well. A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does it very effectively. There is no encounter of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body. <br /> <br /> If the rickety cam doesn't bother you too much, enjoy this movie and hope it somehow continues the franchise.
