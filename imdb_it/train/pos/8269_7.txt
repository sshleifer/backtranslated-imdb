I was fascinated by this movie for a while, partly because of the extremely high score here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 with over 300 votes gives the highest rating of any accessible silent movie! How had I not heard of this film before this site? Well, you can't always trust the ratings. This is actually a very good film, well preserved if the good VHS transfer I rented is an indication - excellent acting of principals, particularly William Haines as Brown, and good location work in Cambridge with a good film of action in the Harvard climate / Yale football - but the story must have seemed like a chestnut also in 1926. A hateful, self-centered and charismatic boy goes to school and is put in his place, becoming a caring friend unselfish; I doubt that people in 1926 found much of what was really exciting in the last few rolls, the predictability factor is high. However, it starts very well, and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not praised in heaven. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now more than 600 voters and the score has risen to 9.2! Seriously, folks, here's the runoff - I challenge anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
