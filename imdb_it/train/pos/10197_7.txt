Well, it's been a long year and I'm down to review the final film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) was the second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it didn't go very well at the box office because it was too artistic for ordinary viewers, especially since MMFF is the season in which many families go out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> curious enough to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English on the screen. I thought that Cesar Montano did a good job both as a director and as a protagonist. His great vision and creativity have really helped this film. He was also very effective as a protagonist and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film. Even performing well was the young actress Rebecca Lusterio. He did a great job playing Bikay, Duroy's younger sister. I hope to see it in many other film projects in the future, perhaps venturing into other genres. I think the fact that this film was in his local dialect really helped. <br /> <br /> Some camera shots in the film have been very well done. The scenery was made breathtaking even though I feel that if a minor effort would have been completely different. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, I think the writers could have gone further into the life of the minor characters in the film. I certainly won't be thrilled with the story of this movie.
