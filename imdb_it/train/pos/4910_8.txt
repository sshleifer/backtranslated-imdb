This great film crackles with tension. The stakes are obviously high - will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, capture the criminals who do not know they are carrying the plague before a large-scale epidemic breaks out? But smaller plot elements introduce tension into every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, among the villains played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying man struck by the plague that Palance mistakenly believes is the object of a hunt for 'man because he smuggled in some precious commodity, between Widmark and his wife, and with the basic question whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic. The film is beautifully shot by Kazan, in long and extravagant choreographers set in New Orleans, and ends in a breathtaking climax, in which Palance escapes like a mouse from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city. The comment is superb, probably the best I've heard, covering the cinematography, the framing and lighting of the shots, the design of the production, the casting of non-professional actors in small roles, and ironies and parallels in the plot, like an in-depth seminar on the cinematographic techniques of the 1950s and the film noir in general. Watch it once to enjoy the movie alone and, if you're interested in making a film, a second time with the comment to learn.
