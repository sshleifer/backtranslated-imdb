"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but to paint, go with her friends on her wagon up and down, greet the people in the city and try to match all those who knows. I guess there were no movies, no television back then, and the girls had nothing to do but chat. I wish he had read a little more. I like Gwyneth and I think she's a lovely young woman. He has talent and in "Emma" one has the privilege of listening to Gwyneth sing. I can't wait to see "Duetti", where he supposedly sings. He has the courage to speak British English with all those British natives, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dancing at Lughnasa). "Mrs Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors of 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American film, being none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Blythe Award Winner Danner (The Myth of Fingerprints). Hopefully it will be around for a very long time. Lucky us! I liked Emma and I also recommend her to me. It's one of those old stories that are still accurate in those days. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I particularly like when he sings a duet. Favorite quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you didn't ask me to contribute to a riddle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a riddle, Mr. Knightley, I thought you had an excessive qualification." Miss Bates: "He left us speechless, speechless, I tell you, and we haven't stopped talking about it since."
