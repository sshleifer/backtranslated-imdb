I must say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. I looked at it several times now and I still feel like I did the first time; that this film alone could constitute the entire curriculum of a post-graduate course in film directing. <br /> <br /> Long ago the movie trailers promised: "It will make you laugh, it will make you cry". This is a very trivial and synthetic method to describe what the Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places of human experience and the next moment brings you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the film focuses on the cycle back and forth between people close to happiness and the same people close to horror. It's always a short step, too. Only to manage that swing with grace and without making it seem false or exaggerated is the genius of the director. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (of sorts) coming soon. After having induced the public to rock back and forth across the emotional spectrum, the film turns a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and vice versa, but instead intensifies from a normal conjugal spit, through an accidental self-inflicted wounded knife that may or may not require points, to an earthquake that has the characters running from home. At the moment of their relief, a forgotten topic, the forgotten finger cut off, the earthquake survived, a neighboring woman says her old husband collapsed. The couple rushes to his aid. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw him. I'm crying now. It is not sadness that does this to me. It is not a particularly sad sequence. What makes me cry is that these few minutes of film were PERFECT. It's perfect! Astounding. (end of spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is so much to say about the Grand Canyon. Describes relatively normal people who experience epiphanies and allows the viewer to experience them indirectly. They are not flashy or exaggerated and there is not a long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film moves with the rhythm of life. Even when the characters try to make sense of what happened, they are uncertain about what comes from their experience. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human film.
