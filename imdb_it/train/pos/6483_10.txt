This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it must be said, marks the beginning of the end of the Second World War. The origins are not completely examined completely by the fall of Germany at the hands of the Treaty of Versailles, which helped to push the demonic rise of Hitler, but as one reviewer says, this must be difficult to do, in a series of 26 parts with so so much to cram. <br /> <br /> In addition to the planned photography / combat action, there are a lot of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told by giving the viewer a surprising intuition, especially if you are not necessarily a fan / fan of the second world War. Episodes that showed "testimonies" and how life was on the home fronts of the main allies / adversaries, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States were quite open. Showing the extreme ferocity of the war on the front line and, of course, the suffering of civilians, extermination camps, etc., were well managed and exposed. I would highly recommend it in any history lesson for the younger generation (which could be said to be one in 47!). Some things are strangely overlooked, such as the advent of the start of the new jet, with Frank Whittle's experimental gloster jet and the combat debut of Gloster Meteor and that of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially since the V-1 was seen make his debut and there was a surprisingly smaller mention of the V2. This is probably a small oversight, unrelated to the most sensational and fantastic weapons that the Second World War brought forth from a more despicable old science. But a great series that has left its mark and has done so since when it is repeated fortunately. <br /> <br /> A series to possess as a casket in historical terms, on DVD for anyone, in particular, who is a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
