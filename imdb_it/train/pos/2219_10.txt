This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that few African Americans know. My two sons are produced by a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a woman of black skin whose parents were former slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was excluded from all his family, except for one sister who took pity on his brothers; raise 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; provide the family with food whenever they could. Of course he secretly helped this family to fear for his own communication. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We were part of our library.
