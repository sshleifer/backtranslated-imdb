This film is a great example of fine storytelling. The acting is superb. The plot is challenging without being overly manipulative or false. There were a couple of points where they probably made people a little bit better or worse than they really were, but considering it's a Hollywood movie, they showed incredible control. There wasn't a single explosion shown in the film, even though they had an opportunity. The film, despite having parts of suspense, was not turned into an action movie. The story is so made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately common times. Very well!
