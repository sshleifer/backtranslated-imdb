I saw this film for the first time when I was about seven years old and I was completely enchanted, but for years I couldn't find out what the film was called. now I'm twenty-one and I stumbled upon the movie about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a bit confused, I was not at all disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb, evoking a whole world that is so believable and so well animated that you are attracted to the film alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant adults and children alike. with a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-built love story, this movie won't let you down. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.
