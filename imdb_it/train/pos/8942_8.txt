A number of contributors mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. He was 25 and 50 years old when this film was released. I think the difference wasn't important for a suspense film like Vertigo, but it's important for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, because his character would be attracted to her, but it is less clear why his would be attracted to his. <br /> <br /> However, the film works like a light romantic fantasy. The scene in which she stares at him through the cat's head, with her dark painted eyebrows turning on and the sound of her humming and purring cat, is the real magic. It's a little disconcerting, then, when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron Building, and we see the age difference very abruptly. As he embraces her, he gets up to run his fingers through his hair, but stops that movement and merely touches his fingertip lightly with his fingertips.
