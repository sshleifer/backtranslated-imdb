(No need to summarize the plot, since others have already done it.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find fault with the film, grown as we are with the flapping of the sensational experience today's motion picture. In this context, a film like Ecstasy seems to have wandered from another planet. I think there are several valid reasons why. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film takes place poetically, while the camera moves slowly over hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates man and the woman in her fold. Together they reveal a style and a dimension that are almost entirely lacking in the cinema driven by today's technology, in which rapid-focus editing works to divert the attention of the public and not to concentrate it. Furthermore, the plot is transmitted by the eye and not by the ear, almost without dialogue to explain what is happening. This amounts to another extreme departure from today's literal tariff, where images seem to count only when they excite the public. But perhaps the most disturbing thing ... the film is sometimes strangely silent, not in the sense that silent films are silent since we expect them to be. But in the sense that the characters rarely speak when we expect them to do so. Thus, the burden of history is shared between the filmmaker and the viewer. The first must choose his images in an artistic way to convey the narration, while the second must think of the visual ones, since they will not be explained. <br /> <br /> None of these are intended to detract from the film of today - manufacture. It is enough to point out that a film like Machaty's comes from an aesthetic very different from the one we have today. I do not pretend to be neither better nor worse. However, I argue that ecstasy represents a perspective that is seriously absent from today's cinematic experience, in which such contemplative values ​​are regularly dismissed as slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully composed beer garden scene with its last shot of a crane standing up to reveal the exquisite framework below. Even the very slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature and regeneration are wonderfully expressed. These are the kind of scenes that don't submerge you, but instead - given a half chance - they accumulate quietly in a memorable experience in its own way, like the tingling variety of a "Jaws". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy, like when Machaty accumulates images, particularly in the final, ode-to-work sequence. It is difficult to know what to do with this rather disruptive presence. Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work reserves for the hero and the people in general - a theme later promoted by the influential Soviet cinema. However, his presence here is rather boringly overcome. <br /> <br /> However, I must admit that I initially tuned in to see the wonderful Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that in the process I also achieved much more than just a puzzle in the woods.
