I had seen so much of the series that I could watch on television, but unfortunately, I started a job that made me work evenings. I managed to get some recordings, at least ... and, of course, I bought the recently released DVD of the complete series. Looking at the DVD, you can see that the animation was a little crude at first, but they smoothed out a fair number of defects after the pilot had finished. The voices are suitable for the characters and the writing is excellent. It is rather refreshing to see the animation return to its roots by reintroducing themes for adults. The fact is that, with the way society has come in the last century, you have to be a little more brazen about today's standards to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations parallel to those we often face in real life. It's your typical sitcom in this regard, but humor is more like what you'd expect from late-night television like a skit talk show or Saturday Night Live ... when SNL was really fun. Good work, Dreamworks. Perhaps you need to work with one of the most liberal networks to keep this series going ... and also improve the marketing of the goods for the series to help sustain its high costs. But it is a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature. Hmm ...
