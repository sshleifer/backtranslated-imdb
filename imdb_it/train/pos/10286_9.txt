This movie is fantastic! Despite being fun and funny, he is also profoundly deep and open his eyes. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a boy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but that's not what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is harsh, dissatisfied and resentful that his life is not the way he imagines it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he imagined he would have required to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of getting everything, he loses the only person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that was to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspirational and profound. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with deeply humbling respect because we are very often much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition: "That we do not lose ourselves and those who count as we try to find out".
