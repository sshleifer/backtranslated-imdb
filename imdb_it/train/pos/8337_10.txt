Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore having seen a large number of these films, it is rare for one to strike me as totally unique. Moreover, it is equally rare that I have labored breathing through laughter during different scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I would say that it is probably the best, since this romantic comedy has the accent on "comedy", and in any case extends the limits of credibility only a little more than Mi like most com coms. The four scientists have provided some of the funniest moments not only in this movie, but in any movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a "10" on a "9" as an assessment, since I believe too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses part of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but this is one of the few movies I've seen where I'd say it's completely obscured. She and Tim Robbins are chosen as protagonists, but for me it is the second violin of the antics of clumsy intellectuals. An authentic film like a laugh.
