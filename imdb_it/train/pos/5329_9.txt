This film was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was absurd. <br /> <br /> Action sequences have been invented. <br /> <br /> But, provided you can lighten up enough to laugh, it was a really electrifying game combining Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad guys were more stupid than bad. The good guys weren't too good. Black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of a child has added a positive touch. Sympathy could have been a little difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I do not agree on acting. It was, on the whole, very good. I really wanted to punch Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And, after all, isn't the mark of a really good movie that wants to punch Judge Reinhold?
