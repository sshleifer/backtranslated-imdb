The beautiful story of Stardust was written by Neil Gaiman (author of MirrorMask) and it's a really good story. I think any maze, princess bride or fan of the tenth kingdom would like it, yet it is absolutely unique and stands alone. And I feel that the film adaptation of this story has a much better ending than what was presented in Neil Gaiman's original novel. I won't ruin it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and fairy slave held by a witch in the fairy realm. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a shooting star, Tristan promises to recover it for a girl he is infatuated with. He is not aware of the fact that the star took the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others who follow her too. Three old witches who want to use his heart to become young again, and some quarrelsome principles. <br /> <br /> It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful scenes and surreal images. It is fascinating and I feel it can be seen by children and adults of all ages. It is simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, a genre I've never seen in cinema since the 1980s.
