OK, it's not a perfect movie, but I disagree with the general opinion of IMDb that it's really bad. I watched a lot of flix from Hong Kong in the 90s and loved the era a lot. I never saw "Black Mask" at the time and only saw it for the first time last week. Apart from the embarrassing dubbing that my DVD copy didn't give me the chance to turn off, the film contains the energy and the bravado that permeated Hong Kong films at the time. I keep sticking to my guns saying that, when it comes to action, these guys, no matter what their budget, add an element of magic to the screen without Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I'm not knocking these films - I think that they lack the spontaneity of this and they feel too regulated) they will never succeed in realizing themselves. What is that? It is the feeling that the directors are experimenting while they are spinning and riding, they are not afraid of leaving imperfections in order to learn the lessons for the next time. For me, this makes watching movies so much more fun and dangerous.
