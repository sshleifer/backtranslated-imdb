I totally disagree with the other reviews. Everything basically negative. I took a chance on this movie and I was glad I did. Really. I didn't find anything wrong with this. No period. The script is original. I'm all nice and convincing. Dee Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady of the Brady Bunch. But this girl can really act. The setting in the Australian Outback is perfect. Incredible scenery. Great soundtrack, such as Paul Kelly. God bless Paul Kelly. The Cranberries are here too. I've seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably watch it again. It's interesting. It makes one. It was probably (probably) better than nine-tenths of the so-called Hollywood hits that were also out during this period. Back Of Beyond is a nice movie. Well photographed. I didn't find anything wrong with it. Check out! My first review!
