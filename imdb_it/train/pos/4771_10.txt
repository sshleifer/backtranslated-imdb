The zenith of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, better known for less accessible material, creates a delicate and refined story around the most unlikely premise. A man travels to see his estranged brother. Having no other means of transport, his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawnmower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, offers an extraordinarily layered and nuanced performance in the lead role. Surprisingly beautiful in its exultation of small things, Straight Story is a classic cinematic experience not to be missed. Sissy Spacek is noteworthy as the daughter of Farnsworth, a compromised middle-aged woman who lives with the loss of her children.
