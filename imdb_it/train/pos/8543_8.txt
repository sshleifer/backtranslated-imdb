This was one of those movies that I probably never would have picked from the shelf, but one day he came to IFC and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed channels, I would have really lost a treasure. <br /> <br /> The theme is depressing - young author paralyzed in convalescents climbing on ascent in the lower class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to make him a tear-jerky manipulator. But this does not happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez, after he was accidentally paralyzed. No Hollywood happiness here. All patients in the ward come from very different backgrounds, but share a feeling of powerlessness, of being at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "lone wolf" type, forced into an embarrassing addiction to his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine as a former lord of a woman whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake like a guy determined to charge someone for taking away his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
