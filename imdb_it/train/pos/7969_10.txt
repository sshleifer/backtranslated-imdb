Homeward Bound is a beautiful film. You know, the part where the Shadow falls into the ditch ... cozy, I * cried *, considering I was only six, I cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! Dogs and cats are well trained. A nice family film, * not * for non-hairy people completely hardened or people who hate animals, but who could do without people like me. <br /> <br /> A good movie in general, 10/10!
