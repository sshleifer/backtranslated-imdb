Japanese indie films with humor and philosophy in which the three protagonists move literally almost throughout the film, chasing each other because of strange circumstances and comic coincidences. As they run, we see what is happening in their minds and how they got to where they are at the moment. The act of running is a metaphor for these lives of the poor. In a sense, what they are really hunting is not what they were originally chasing, but the meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and their broken dreams. Running makes them feel truly alive. The great adventure in life-changing racing ends when they accidentally come across something big, violent and so absurd that it's cleverly fun. One of my favorite movies of all time from the brilliant director Sabu.
