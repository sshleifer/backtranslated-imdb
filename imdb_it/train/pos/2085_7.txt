"The Good Earth" by Sidney Franklin has gained a classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting, especially by Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers' performance is so complete, it's almost unrecognizable. Having very little dialogue throughout the film (and it's a long one), Rainer relies instead on face and body language. Look and act Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with his work could easily exchange it as such. <br /> <br /> The film remains relevant today because it explores the history of a stable and the wealth and universal themes that derive from it. When Lung and his wife O-Lan finally reach financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of goods but meaningless. It is only when they return to earth after fighting a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to look at) that find satisfaction again. A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially in 1937) makes the film a classic. The money is worth nothing without friends and family, a point that the film returns home perfectly in the last 10 minutes with an exciting conclusion.
