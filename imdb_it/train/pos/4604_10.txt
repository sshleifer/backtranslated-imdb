This film is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 for all the people out there who are considering this low-level movie because it doesn't have a "good story" or something, it's ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad at because of its plot is like saying that a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! You watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, because the action is not so focused on a good story or something, if you look at how it makes films and compares them with other American films of that era and even later you will realize that the Jackie Chan films had the best battle scenes and not so good plots, while the American movies had good plots but disgusting action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Porn is watched for porn, Jackie Chan is watched for ACTION, I think people misjudge her because there is no plot because you think it is like an intelligent film critic judges a good movie, but the way it is I see it's a good movie is a movie that can make me have fun. Of course, the central part of the film was boring, VERY BORANTE, but in this way the rest, which is all action scenes and acrobatics, pays a lot for everything. This changed the way American action films were created, they even stopped the scenes in this movie. If you want a real man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many others by Jackie Chan, it's pure anyway. It literally makes American films like a walk in the park, and even in TODAY movies. American films rely heavily on special effects and safety cables and double stunts and much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are work pieces of a true entertainer who freaks out and has a lot of talent in what he can do. a masterpiece
