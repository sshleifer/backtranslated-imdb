Greetings still from the darkness. The extraordinary photograph underlines this Disney documentary and offers a glimpse of some of the harshness of desert animals. For all the over 40s, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom have provided much of our knowledge of wild animals since our childhood ... when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What always fascinates is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Watching elephants trudging for days, almost delirious due to the lack of water, is really painful. But their night battle against the lions is electrifying. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater shots are out of breath. Mothers and small humpback whales are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack the prey is just as chilling as "Jaws". The most incredible scenario for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I had never seen such a detail of the vastness of the range. <br /> <br /> I don't think most kids today will be too excited by this, but it's definitely one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever photographed.
