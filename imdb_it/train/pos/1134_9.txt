The only missing part in this film is the part of Shue as a daughter who wants to follow in the footsteps of "aunt" like a star of daytime soap. Otherwise it would be perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems that every actor has had fun with his parts and with the excessive result of satisfying his own fun and script - I have to ask myself if a little advertising wasn't t that take place in parts. It has been well launched and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic film that everyone should see at least once. I would advise you not to drink anything that may sting you from the nose. <br /> <br /> You will surely want to look closely at the last scene, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret she would rather not share with you. <br /> <br /> If you like daytime soaps or despise them, this move is fun in all the right places.
