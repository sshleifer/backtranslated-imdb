PG-13 rating for violence, brief sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story a couple of times. In my opinion, Police Story is the best film of Chan in the 80s. Originally he made it because he didn't like the other film by the policeman who had to act in The Protector. I didn't see the protector so I can't compare it. The acting is not bad and the plot is quite good. I remember the plot well because I saw this movie a while ago, but what I remember is that this film has a lot of action, acrobatics and comedies, just what a good movie Chan needs. If you can find Police Story and then you are Chan's fan then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Runtime: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
