Miss DeCarlo's feature debut has everything the writers could come up with: from the Franco-Prussian war to the American civil war, the great American West, San Francisco in its golden days, ballet, opera, vaudeville, banned as a coach and Chinese junk. Just when you thought the plot couldn't become more shriveled, it is. It's magnificent, he took his tongue in his cheek. The character of De Carlo (here called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, is the role that dances) is based freely on the career of the infamous Lola Montez, who was the lover of the King of Prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the jewels of the crown. He fled to the American west. There is a city in Arizona called "Salome, Where She Danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who falls under his charm are not historically accurate, nor do I assume that he is the wise Chinese with a Scottish accent - but he is one of my all-time favorite classics and DeCarlo is incredibly beautiful in everything.
