I remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I see him again and fall in love with this film. The story behind the film is fascinating in itself. The cast makes it much more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely on top of her game in this photo. He puts on the mannerisms, the accent and even the appearance of Mrs. Chamberlain. She shows the pain, the wound, the surprise and the anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it is hard to remember that she is NOT Lindy. In my opinion, this Meryl's performance was better than her Oscar-winning performance in "Sophie's Choice", and she should have gotten her third Oscar. Sam Neill is as perfect as Michael Chamberlain and, for some surprising reason, he was not recognized by the Academy with at least one nomination. In all, this film receives only one Oscar nomination (Streep's for best actress.) However, she has received numerous Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> Definitely a quality film: it tells a great story and you get great shows from all the cast.
