A great movie. The acting - from the doctor to the street artist to the lead prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought that soni razdan (sig.rable) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the lesser known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who could be accused of exaggerating, presented a rather credible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the camera work - and the way it captured the energy of the bombay streets, the tranquility of Gustad reciting his prayers and life inside of the tiny apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall that becomes a sanctuary and then is demolished - and philosophical artists take it. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see good films on Indian themes.
