In a word: excellent. This is THE FILM. Go and watch it. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a fantastic job, as usual. An incredible attention to detail, bright colors and decorations, breathtaking atmosphere of Whoville, surprising variety of costumes. Wait, there's more, the story is very good. There is clearly a message to be extracted from reflective spectators. Jim Carrey is top notch. Probably the best Grinch possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is really good. I'm sure she has a great future. The dog is strong. All in all, it is a very high quality Christmas fairy tale. If you like fairy tales, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Reading some other reviews here ... Take a life. It hurts me every time to see people out there that ... well ... they have their hearts two sizes too small.
