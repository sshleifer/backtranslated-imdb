What can I say that was not said on "The Haunting"? It has everything that would look great. Wonderful sets, moody music and sound design to die for were all right. The script sometimes drives the mind crazy in such a strange and surreal way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it, perhaps because they were too busy creating CG effects and creating gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was. Each cast member gives a worthy performance, even if with little conviction to the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the maximum to do while the others react mainly to her. But that's all. All I can say is that it was a pleasant two hours, but you will surely want more. Much more.
