What a night. Perry Mason then has Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 22:30 "Sea Hunt" arrived with his wonderful opening theme music and Mike's boat that set sail for a new adventure . Fantastic .. Regardless of the story, he was the protagonist (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A man and a boy. This brought an interest in boats that lasted for years. Because they are not shown via cable or made available on video, no idea .. Too bad.
