An interesting TV movie based on real facts, betrayed by the description of one of the main characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays the younger brother, who has the delicate mission of deciding whether to appeal to the courts for the death penalty of his brother. But when he goes to see him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with the acting ability of Koteas. It seems only the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "G.Q." magazine, with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This awareness came to me after meeting an old friend again, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, who he spent in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew left, not only because he is older, but because of his exposure to the penal system for a prolonged period. There are jails and prisons, it must be said, but this prisoner in "Shot In the Heart" is definitely out of the world.
