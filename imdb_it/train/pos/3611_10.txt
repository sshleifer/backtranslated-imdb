I saw this movie after seeing Blue Crush and other Michelle movies, I thought he had a bleak future in this business. I was very wrong after seeing his performance in "Girlfight" I was amazed in the way he captures the emotion of one fighter, but also a warrior. her and her brother, the way he transmits anger when he is hit. His characters learn to bend in the film of never being able to mount a wall and hide from love, or that just because he has power he will not win. I think this role was perfect for Michelle even though she had no previous experience, the director saw the talent, I criticized myself for not having seen the talent in her.
