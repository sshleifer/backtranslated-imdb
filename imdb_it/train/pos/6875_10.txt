When I was president of our college coffee shop, one of our tasks was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to do in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was shown off-off on Broadway in cinemas where television monitors were placed throughout the audience, so everyone had a fantastic place. The premise was that the skits would change regularly - on Saturday Night Live, keeping it cool. They decided to turn it into a film for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I think the developers said it was the first time that Chevy Chase was in the cinema. Watching him run naked despite the woods being a howl. Like many of the reviews before mine, it was Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this video. I spoke to my 13-year-old son of Koko, the clown. He can't wait to have a copy!
