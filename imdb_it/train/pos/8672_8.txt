The 2006 WWE's latest PPV, turned out to be a hit with the fans, but only for one reason, the ladder game that was to be just Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent December to Dismember PPV crap, WWE knew he had to do something to make the fans talk again, this came in handy when he introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match would be a match of the scale. <br /> <br /> The game was brutal and one of the best scale games I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total disaster. Johnny Nitro didn't even check his partner, they continued unsuccessfully, and Taylor and Regal didn't do anything during the game, except for the people hit with some straight shots. Eventually London and Kendrick kept the titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on the show Kane defeated the MVP in a hellish game when he set fire to the stupid MVP costume. Chris Benoit shot down Chavo Guerrero in a decent game, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE Cruiserweight title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker collaborated with Finlay at Facing John Cena and Batista. The action was poor and no one cared who Batista chose for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane defeated the MVP in a hellish game. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick kept the WWE Mark the titles of the teams against Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a straight game. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeats Chavo Guerrero to keep the American title in a decent game. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to maintain the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible game. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker beat Mr. Kennedy in a final race. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in an abysmal game. <br /> <br /> Overall grade - B
