Not a bad word to say about this movie really. Initially it didn't hit me, but it grew rapidly. I like it a lot and I think it's a shame that many people can't see beyond the fact that it's been banned in some territories, mine is one of them. The film offers the shock, gore and atmosphere department. The score is a nice piece of suspense delivery apparatus. It seems fair that Chris Young has become one of the best composers in the industry. The acting in this film is of a fairly high standard, if a little wood in some places, and the effects are very real and gritty. All this is a great praise for a good slasher movie in my book. I noticed in some reviews that the film had a serious attack with the famous hit of the killer P.O.V. And I ask: WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT ??? It's a classic shot that evokes the fear of every good fan of the genre and it's a great secret to keep the killer identity a secret. The only thing that prevents this film from getting the highest marks in my book is that the surprise blow (revelation of the killer) is not handled more carefully, I mean it happens quickly, even if the great performances make it almost credible. Apart from that, PRANKS is a great film (although I prefer the original title) and it's a shame that so many people eliminate it as a piece of cheap shit. It is more than this, but only a few know how it seems to be lost in the fog of the early 1980s. What a pity .... It is a really good movie! Believe me!
