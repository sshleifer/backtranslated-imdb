This movie is fun to watch, doesn't have a lot of plot (well, there's no storyline), but there are good jokes and situations you will laugh at. The basic plot is Cheech is trying to have a nice date, while Chong is cheering with Cheech's cousin (they smoke drugs, enter a music store, a massage parlor, a comedy club and even enter someone's they don't even know! Rated R
