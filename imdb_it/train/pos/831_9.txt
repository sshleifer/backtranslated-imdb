I saw this film while it was in a limited edition, mainly because of the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen throughout the year. It starts almost like a thriller, but progresses steadily in a hilarious piece of work full of jokes and great comic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Moreover, while I say that this film is a comedy, it does not forget that sometimes it has a heart and can be very touching when necessary. When I went to the theater I didn't know what to expect more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Leaving the theater, I felt very fulfilled by the film and I plan to see it again in a large version. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good play with a well-written script and a big mustache.
