I love! What's wrong? - you have your sub-suburb, you have your zombies, you have the problems of your family, you have your social dilemmas, you have taken yourself a beautiful retro-style meat from the 50s in the background held at the bay by a worried worried if I'm the next Upper Crust meal. You couldn't ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante home from social climbing. It is at once unbridled and criminally conspiratorial. The dream of every man. K'sun is really as big as the son who is trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow he will succeed. It is a real presence on the screen. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious cop with sharp instincts and a little squeamishness as if he were his daily character. Billy Connolly is as delicious as Fido. A good actor: I'd like him to play the lead role in "Braveheart", directed by Gibson. My feeling is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the real character. His Fido is content, but accessible. A nice touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a great and wonderful satire on morals, values, social stings, feelings, growth, dealing with uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. A real reality show.
