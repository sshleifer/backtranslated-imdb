My wife is a teacher and is very familiar with the story, having read it in many of her lessons. It never seemed so interesting to me, and I bought the DVD thinking that this would be a movie that really wasn't going to be my alley. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of set-ups and I found myself thinking that I was right. Start a little slow and I have to admit that I was a little bored - but curious enough to be with it. Boy, I'm glad I did because this was a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would certainly watch it again! <br /> <br /> The casting was very good. Since I haven't read the book, I can't guarantee the accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really delicious. You liked the characters you were supposed to, you hated the ones you had to hate, and you laughed at those that had to be fun. <br /> <br /> I can see how some may not like this movie. Sometimes it's boring, especially in the beginning. All flashbacks can be distracting (although they are essential to the story). Once the story begins to come together at the end, I think you are rewarded for your patience. On balance, I think this is a great movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
