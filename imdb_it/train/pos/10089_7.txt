. . . or typing on a computer keyboard, they would probably give this eponymous film a "10" rating. After all, no elephant is killed during the film; it is not even implied that anyone is hurt. In contrast, the ELEPHANT WALK master, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms - no matter how threatening - without government permission (and his tone suggests that these permits are not inside the realm of probability). In addition, the elements conspire - in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic - to leave the Wiley plantation vulnerable to the total destruction of the Elephants (as the natives call them) to close the story. If you happen to see the current EARTH version, you will find that the people of Elephant are doing less well today.
