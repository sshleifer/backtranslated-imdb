This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk in his highest tension. Avoid the tender nostalgia for "All That Heaven Permalink here" and the whining sentimentality of "Imitation of Life" and preferably for feverish anxiety and overheated tension. And, of course, it's all captured in the vibrant Technicolor. <br /> <br /> The history of cornball has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that becomes a rivalry when Hudson draws on Lauren Bacall's affections, but who is really paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her stunning performance exaggerated as Stack's sister, who takes over the family business when no one else will. A highlight of the film comes when this wild and lively child breaks into a frantic dance in his bedroom, unable to withstand the restrictions imposed on her by bourgeois property. As often happens in Sirk's films, the scene is both unintentionally exhilarating in its absurdity, albeit strangely moving in its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Sirk approached more than anyone else to transform the pure field into high art, satisfying the Philistines and eyebrows at the same time within the same films. His was a unique talent and I don't know if he has ever been another director like him since. <br /> <br /> Vote: A-
