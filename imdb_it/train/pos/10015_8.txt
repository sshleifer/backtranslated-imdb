Famous radio narrator Gabriel Nobody (Robin Williams, steep and speaking in silent and hypnotic tones) becomes a friend and friend of a fourteen year old boy from Wisconsin, Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who wrote a book describing sexual abuse by the his parents. To boot, Pete has AIDS and this forces Gabriel even more, since his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) seems to be an HIV survivor himself. <br /> <br /> He also gets acquainted with the guardian of Pete, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets that (of course) he was not willing to find. <br /> <br /> Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes longer) ) than one might think that a film of this kind can work. This is positive as it keeps the action and the plot lean and clear. It's ugly because it leaves several holes in the plot and doesn't mend any of the openings of the plot or back-story. I would prefer not to go into the smallest details except to say that, if you are not familiar with Mr. Maupin's works or his personal story, you feel a little off the beat here. Still, Williams's performances (I would have liked to hear more of his narrative, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and most of the supporting cast (the waitress at the restaurant Collete's Donna attends does a great job with that small part she has! ) are first-rate and the atmosphere established here - that is to say, the cold, lonely dark outsiders of Wisconsin and New York - give a formidable framework for this story. It may have ends that don't come together in a particular way, but it's still a pretty compelling story to deal with.
