TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is probably the best film of all Mary Pickford films. At two hours, it was long enough for a silent film of 1922, but it continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was shot. Mary offers one of her best performances, sometimes the role looks like a "greatest hits" performance with fragments of Mary the innocent, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary the spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine, etc. Features that have often been used in a single film in the past. The film is surprisingly frank about the illegitimate son of a secondary character for 1922 and at some point our Little Mary is considered the unmarried mother in question! If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the Oscar for best actress would have been Mary's.
