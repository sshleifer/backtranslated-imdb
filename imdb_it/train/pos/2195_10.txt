I loved it! Fred MacMurray is as wonderful as Skid Johnson, a somewhat presumptuous, proud but at the same time very vulnerable saxophonist who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard) who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie gets off a ship and ends up in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony is stabbed in the nose after insulting Maggie thinking she is a silly woman - all because she took her hat off in public. Big fight and Maggie ends up stuck in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are fantastic together. Maggie is always there for him whenever she needs her. She urges him to go to New York where (he looks at the film well and finds out). They have these wonderful scenes together where he sings in his arms while the saxophone plays. I highly recommend it.
