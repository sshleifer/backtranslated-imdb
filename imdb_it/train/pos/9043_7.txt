One day I accidentally came across this TV movie. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for broadcasting good films. This, however, was nothing less than good. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by Sputnick's launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends start building rockets. His father is not happy that his children discover a new hobby and would rather see him become a coal miner like him or go to college with a scholarship like his brother. <br /> <br /> History is well written. Perhaps a little too predictable, but that's okay because it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It's an important part, but where the inner action is obvious, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clichés, but that's fine. It is based on real events, so it is not possible to abandon these clichés. The characters are really good. Where the story is down the characters are taken out and keep the action and quality of the film high. You will know these characters and you will have sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> This is a good looking movie. The sets and style of the 50s are accurate and the images are well composed and well lit. All this makes the atmosphere of the film very good. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal offers a great performance like Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is as good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are also good. Overall this represents a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> All in all I'm glad I took this movie. It was the first one after seeing it that I learned was based on real events. If I had known that seeing it, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a beautiful and interesting film. It's a film that I think everyone can enjoy. It's a kind of wellness film. It's not bad at all!
