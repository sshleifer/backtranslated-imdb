And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. No matter how it evolved (to the point of being a disco film), it ended up as one of the best films in which children want to go out, but the main one is on their way. Think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50s where the day is saved when Alan Freed arrives in town with Chuck Berry to show that Rock & Roll Music is really nice and safe for children, and Weld gets a new Tuesday sweater for dance. Forward until 1979, repeat the same storyline, but throw DA RAMONES, which no one would later realize would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ's guest shot, "The Real" Don Steele) . He also throws all the elements of a film of exploitation of the comedy of Roger Corman, except for two days of filming, some of the famous Corman repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (there from "Bucket of Blood" ), and you have one of the great stoopid films of the day. One of the few films that deliberately uses generosity and gets along. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember having seen some parts of it through a stoner-induced haze at the drive-in, and agreed that this is one of the great movies to watch drunk, not least for the adorable main women and the great video of the Ramones.
