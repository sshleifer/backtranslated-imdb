The premise of this film has tickled my imagination for quite some time. We have all heard or read it in a kind of con-text. What would you do if you were all alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappeared before your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates who live in a ruined house in the middle of a highway system. Andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers of the company. This is the main reason why these two guys get along so well, because they limit each other to turn to when comfort is needed. Only until ... <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film many and many problems have occurred. Both are involved in the crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn't dare leave the house. Dave is not successful in his work and his colleagues do not treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The amount of problems they face continues to increase until that day when they may face the inevitable and face it. This is simply too much for them and they want everything to go away ... And of course this is exactly what happens. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in this world of nothing. At first they are surprised and have trouble understanding and dealing with the characteristics of this crazy environment, but later they will discover that they can do whatever they want because they seem to be the only ones left. <Br /> <br /> Nothing has an incredibly small cast - in fact, in addition to the first couple of shots in the film, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the whole movie. It is clear that to get it out, the cast must be more than up to the task, because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing to distract the observer in any way. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up shots to make it more interesting and actually works quite well. The director of photography, Derek Rogers, also has a nice way to tease the audience by retaining visual information, especially at times when a character sees something and reacts to it, but we don't see it right away. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this cannot be an event-driven film and it is not. Most of the action takes place outside the home when they move in a vacuum. And this is where some of the most hilarious scenes take place, especially in the event that Andrew discovers a candy bar. <br /> <br /> Now, you might think, "How does nothing look like?" Well, it doesn't look like anything at all. The whole world of nothingness is white ... white, no matter which way you look. This is the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less it's extremely boring to watch and there must be events to make sure it's more interesting to watch. Thank God, there are some. For example at times when the two boys, due to the properties of nothingness, are able to jump really high as if nothing was done by ... tofu (as Andrew states). It's fun to see how they are instantly able to use anything to become gods in their own small company. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the film is the set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic did a beautiful job in this film, the house these two guys live in is so unnaturally fun to watch, yet it seems right that these two live in a place like this. All in all, the design of the production is undoubtedly one of the most powerful aspects of this film that makes the film worthy of note ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the film is acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they both are. The camera is on them for every second of the film and, as mentioned above, there are no props in the film, they are really on a naked stage. With a lot of character development and some decent lines, clever dialogues (sometimes incredibly stupid), everything works for that purpose - and this really moves the film from the low-budget area to a well-done manual work. <Br /> <br /> Let's talk a little about the visual effects, because they are certainly worthy of note. Nothing offers visual effects and digital prosthetics equal to any modern horror film. There is a rather terrifying dream sequence in the film, and although The Drews has completely milked that scene, it's still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects of the film is at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the ability to desire everything, so if they can do it vice versa and make things appear? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit film, it really helps to promote the idea that they are probably dead (this is actually one of their theories), but "Nothing" is a comedy and destroys slowly their own theory. We don't know where they are or what happened to them. We don't know if they will ever come out, because the movie ends before we see something like that. The ending, by the way, is not as good as it could have been. It is rather easy to predict what will happen, but the authors have thought of some incident that made it a little more interesting and ultimately satisfyingly satisfying. <br /> <br /> Take "Hollow" Man "," Kill Bill "," Cube "," Epoch "and many other films and you have" Nothing ". It is really an amalgam of different styles, yet there is no no other film (at least the one I know). Nothing is really like. For people who remember the original Cube Production Commentary on his DVD, he could remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he invented Cube's story. Andr√© Bijelic were roommates at a time and both were in this extremely boring room with no hope of going out, "Nothing" could very well be the screen version of the origin of Cube's story, and to that end, it's almost like one of the prequels Cube. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I liked "Nothing", it's a great movie and the different parts of the film are extremely well done with tons of smart ideas, however I feel that the film is missing something and I have trouble finding exactly what it is ... Maybe if we have a "Nothing 2 "I can answer this question. "Nothing" is a great movie, but it's not as good as I expected. <br /> <br /> Final grade: 7.5 / 10
