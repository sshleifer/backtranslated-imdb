I didn't expect the highest level of filmmaking with Joel Schumacher who directed this film, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND wasn't a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the technique, it is often derived from PRIVATE RYAN SAVINGS with the flickering camera, the large shots, the film that runs from time to time as if it were skipping a pinion --- all those techniques that Speilberg had used to make his film more realistic but ultimately more distracted than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not so weak, as the characters in this film seemed more real people and the story less artificial, not so wrapped up in the American flag (Speilberg gets a F 'in subtlety. <br /> <br /> Next to the first section of FULL METAL JACKET by Kubrick, this is the most realistic portrait of the boot camp that I saw in a film, and for this I think it is worth looking at. br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's not even a bad movie.
