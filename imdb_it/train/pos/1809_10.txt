All Dogs Go To Heaven is the cutest animated film to have in 1989. Don Bluth's previous film The Land Before Time (1988) became a hit. Dogs are as cute as little mice. Aw, I just want to hug them when they're cute. Where I was? Oh yes. His animation is beautiful, the characters are fantastic when they are perfectly expressed and the songs are nice and touching. It Opened In November 17 1989 The same date as the mermaid produced by Walt Disney's animation. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so important because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! The song Love Survive performed by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film ever.
