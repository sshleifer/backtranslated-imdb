Oh, those clever Italians. It is not the first time that they base a film on original material without the permission or knowledge of the author of the novel, in this case. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian, but it was done a lot in the early days of cinema, especially because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. The editors of James M. Cain managed to keep this film out of American screens until 1976, but nevertheless the film itself has become a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The film is not so nice to look like the 1946 American version but it's still a great movie. This is obviously not due to the fact that the film is a great strong story, which is intriguing and provides the film with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly identical to the other film versions of its history, with obviously the difference that is set in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Let the Italians make a film about life and the real people in it. These early dramas always have a very realistic feeling about it and are therefore also quite engaging to watch. Unfortunately the film lost some of its power towards the end, when the film started to feel a little too long and dragged into parts. The film could easily be finished 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I don't have much more to say about this movie. It is simply a very well made one, based on equally large and strong source material. An impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some of the greatest and most memorable Italian dramas. <br /> <br /> 8/10
