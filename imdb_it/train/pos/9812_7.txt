"The Big Farewell" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard introduces himself as Dixon Hill private investigator. This episode creates a sort of standard scheme, repeated several times on TNG and on DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to face the program in circumstances other than that of a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand the possibilities of Star Trek and allow a sort of mix of genres. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940s detective fiction and their on-screen representation is called Film Noir, often with the anti-hero stereotype (see for example the stories of Marlowe by Chandler or the all-time classic of Polanski "Chinatown"). Star Trek never focuses on history (mostly it is a simple "how-do-get-out-of-here" scenario) but it allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. These "games" by Holodeck are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of crew members. So the technical aspect is always neglected and from this point of view the stories are never valid (but Star Trek has ever had a technical and scientific point of view, I mean besides some utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> "The Big Goodbye" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who almost never seemed better in an episode of Star Trek (at least the first ones) and Data also has some great scenes (although I find it difficult to believe that pulling the lamp off the wall would have really surprised him, for the fact that he had done some research on that period and his customs). Wesley continues to turn peaceful Trekkies into potential killers (why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him?) But overall this is fun ...
