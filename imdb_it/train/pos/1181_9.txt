Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award-winning short film. A moving story of how to face pain and love the memory of those we have loved and lost. Although, just 15 minutes away, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth about the film in the short span of time. Bud Tingwell makes a touching interpretation of Will, a widower who struggles to cope with his wife's death. Will confronts the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's cow, Tulip. The film shows the pain and responsibility that is felt for those who have loved and lost. Good cinematography, excellent direction and superbly performed. It will bring tears to everyone who has lost a loved one and survived.
