After exchanging a Halloween retelling of the classic Orson Welles radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a true Martian invasion, a group of dying Martians show up on Earth trying to conquer only their plans that go wrong when they are really discovered outside their element and in reality all alone. <br /> <br /> This is often quite good and fun, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. Most likely, science fiction fans will like it. This has stood the test of time for me as it has turned out to be much better than I expected recently. Despite a cast of unnamed stars, this could be the funniest Martian invasion ever made. It is interesting to note that the Martians themselves seem to represent almost all the classic stereotypes of classic Action Hero / Sci-Fi Heroes (cool 1950s teenager, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and mad scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Get ready for DIE! Earth Scum!"
