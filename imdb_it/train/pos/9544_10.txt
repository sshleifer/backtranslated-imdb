Meatball Machine is an incredible splatter movie, has an original storyline with young love, buckets of blood and strange alien creatures that turn people into strange robotic war machines. <br /> <br /> Now the film is not for everyone, people who love splatter movies or the Tetsuo movie: the Iron Man will applaud him. <br /> <br /> Special effects may be poor at certain points in the movie, but yours is not exactly the case for taking the movie seriously. <br /> <br /> Still, all in all it is very funny, well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumors like devourers trying to destroy each other in bloody alien battles.
