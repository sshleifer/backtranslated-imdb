BIRTH: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After being rather disappointed with the original "Tarzan the Ape Man", we discovered between colleagues and historians that the second film "Tarzan and his companion" was the best in the series. It's true. I had a huge success with this film. Johnny Weismuller returns as the divo-oscillator, an animal that duels wild super-hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan takes her role as her totally fantastic lady loves Jane (who wears a two-piece suit for the first and last time here). In my review for "Ape Man", I stepped on Jane well enough for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screams, but she redeemed herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the protagonist of this film, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. Acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, he can work perfectly in the jungle and get along with animals, and he knows how to keep an angry pride of lions at bay when he's out of bullets. Now he even has his scream in the jungle. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. He totally trained him. Cheeta is also quite charming, taking cigarettes from Martin's cigarette. The plot is mainly an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the most violent animals in the jungle, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, although always visible, are much more dynamic and cold and complete the action pleasantly. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Really exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Only wow. When it comes to pre-packaged and dirty action / adventure, nothing holds a candle to "Tarzan and his companion". The inevitable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a violent and risqu√© epic jungle. I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that doesn't take prisoners like this. You would be hard pressed to find a complete scene in this film that is approved by the Code or approved by Animal Rights. The gruesome violence does not even wait for the happy couple in the jungle before pushing the limits of today's adventure movies. And after T & J has entered the picture, there is a lot of afternoon pampering and afternoon dinners. See it yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this movie. In the first movie, Jane seemed a walking contradiction, as if the writers of that time didn't know how to play a character like that. But here is a great precursor for the females of the next cinema. Although she still needs Tarzan's assistance to get her out of most jams, she does more than wait to be saved. His personality is perfectly credible for a woman who lives (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I saw it with my mother and I enjoyed making her notice how Jane "trained" Tarzan, as Jeff Foxworthy said. He totally has the monkey man at every sign and calls. Although there are a number of optical effects dated throughout the film, there are still many Tarzan battles against predatory battles that are performed (mostly) for real. This and the men dressed as monkeys are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The film culminates when the jungle explodes with a shocking orgy of violence in the animal kingdom that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two to breathe again. Even if the couple arrives at sunset gathered and victorious, I cannot help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari that will hear about the previous group of humans who went to see Tarzan and Jane and were never heard again. ** FINE SPOILER ** One of the things that still annoys me is the smooth and hairless body of Johnny Weissmuller and the overstyles bonnet. Besides this, this is pre-Code action-adventure absolutely not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Last film: It Happened One Night (1934). Next movie: Twentieth Century (1934).
