The sensitive film lacks brilliance and, to some extent, narrative structure, but it is still superbly shot and executed. However, the point of the narrative structure is questionable. While giving the impression of tying the loose ends well into the final scenes, and linking his thoughts with what could be described by the modern viewer as a "story", I am skeptical that this feeling * needs * a narrative "structure" that is defined and detectable. Inevitably, it will be compared to SOMERSAULT as the central protagonist (I'm not sure it's the correct word!) It is a young, very young woman, whose newly discovered sexuality confuses and strengthens her, although of course Cate Shortland's film addresses this aspect better, but while there is a chance for daredevil viewers to reject this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is, in some ways, much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. It's definitely very different from Monahan's first feature: THE INTERVIEW, I'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added the story ia. Who knows, maybe they did. Surely they have rammed the compromised and imperfect nature of Weaving's character - though personally I think this was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUST SEEN THE FILM AGAIN ***** **** <br /> <br /> In a second view, I can see how some dismissed it as a telemovie dressed like a feature. But I'm not sure how distinct these "categories" are or even if we should make this distinction. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal, and its content is hardly challenging, at least in the way SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, THE ILLUSTRATED FAMILY, LOOK BOTH WAYS and THE HUMAN TOUCH are. The performances are all good, but I realized that the main reason I was enjoying the movie was because it adapted to the "Australian" genre, without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be quite good reason for a other person * DO NOT * like it! In fact, it wasn't until Lung entered the room of his Vietnamese dress that the film really started to punch. But this brings us into another debate: * should we * expect a film to continually challenge us? Certainly I like to be challenged by a movie (or a book, or other people), but is there no more space for what is simply a good story? <br /> <br /> I did not delete my initial post on this film, because I am all too aware of the Orwellian nuances of such an act. But I'd resize my initial assessment from an 8 to maybe a 6.5. <br /> <br /> As for the nominations for the best AFI film, my grades go to THE HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and WATCH BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK BOTH WAYS should win.
