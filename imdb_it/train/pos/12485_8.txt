I just saw this movie and I have to say I was very impressed. It is very disturbing and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of the seat! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that perhaps at least, there were too many moments of leap. It has come to the point where every single new scene culminated in a leap and this gradually took away the amazing effect, because what was coming was something new. <br /> <br /> Although it contains practically all the clich√©s in the ghost genre, they have all been done so well that they keep the thrill, the fear factor. It had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an old-fashioned scare!
