Great splashy movie of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves throwing dice and organizing illegal shit games. The lover blonde Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if she gives up the dice. He decides the last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who is aiming a lot, is in town. He bets on Sky that he can't convince missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. It may seem a strange summary of the plot, but so is the film! <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed bag - there are wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dance is incredible. In the end the real show is the shit game. Even Brando is really very good here - it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing, but if he pulls it out. I have to admit that seeing Brando, big and bulky, was a lot of fun! Sinatra is also pretty good and Blaine is just as wonderful as his long friend. His numbers of songs and dances are obvious strengths here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but has remained with a dull and colorless role and can't do much about it. The film is too long at 150 minutes: the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag on and should be shortened. Most characters also speak very precise English - contractions are never used. Maybe he's trying to be funny getting out of the gangster's mouth but I found it disconcerting and kept throwing me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching for the songs and the dances but its excessive length comes to you after a while. I give him a 7.
