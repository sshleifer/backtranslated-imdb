I only saw this movie once, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after looking at it I think it's even better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than just horror. He had such a level of emotion and a great characterization that he went through. I especially thought that Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It's a pity he didn't do anything else because he was an excellent actress. Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message through, especially at the end when she realized that although Marc was dead, he knew it would be all right. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which for me is a rarity in modern horror films), in particular the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father chased her with the strange radio in the background and the piece in which the legs broke and crumbled. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent and very moving film.
