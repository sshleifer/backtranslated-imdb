The symbolic use of the objects, the modification of the modules, the position of the characters in the scene ... these were all used with such a joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, mounting when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a bit obvious by today's standards , in the era of silence Volumi spoke about history without saying a word. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet that the lover buys and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
