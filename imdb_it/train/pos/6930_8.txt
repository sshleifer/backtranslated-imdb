This is an unusual and unique small western, made mostly original because of its history that revolves around a single and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who manage to put it in one place or another in the film. > <br /> It is above all a very fun movie to watch, but not without being a real western yet. The film was made in a style typical of the western cinema of the 40s / 50s, so lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its main premise in some unusual way. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is actually the main plot device of the film, it allows the story to follow more characters during the movie, all of which are naturally connected and the story completes the circle at the end. Without that this film would have been rather messy to look at, since history often jumps from one dangerous occasion to another, with constantly different characters involved. Quite surprising how they managed to put Wyatt Earp in all this. But it's not really a criticism. I liked the fact that the film and its story were original and how the film seemed to move from one event to another. He gave the film some sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a really nice movie. I liked the settings used by the film and it seems incredible that this was the first western of the director Anthony Mann. Fortunately he would have directed more westerns later, which would often be the main protagonist of James Stewart. <br /> <br /> It was a rather bold choice to choose James Stewart as the main protagonist. He is one of the softest and most courteous actors who watch and act, so relying on a tough gunslinger seems a little strange. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and shows how versatile and really capable he really was. <br /> <br /> It also has other surprising actors in the film, who are not often connected to this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female role and even the best-known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles. <br /> <br /> A real western with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
