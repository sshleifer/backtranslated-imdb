I just saw Detention last night and I liked what I saw. It was a fun and cool film. Dolph appeared superbly on the bike. Also in this film it was nice compared to his other recent films. Now it's in good shape. The story was ok and the other actors were passable. I wouldn't call this film its best but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But he also had his share of problems. The first was the way bullets flew everywhere and even when they were shot point-blank they missed the target. They should have shown that the bullet escaped from bullets in a better way. Another problem I had was the way the students were swearing. I don't know in which school the students can swear in front of the teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that there were very few bad guys. There should have been other villains. The last problem was certainly the fact that the set seemed poor, but this was due to the small budget. Overall, the film was a good movie. I enjoyed myself. I would recommend others to watch it. Postscript Now you are a cursed cop. (Some One-liners were also beautiful) <br /> <br />
