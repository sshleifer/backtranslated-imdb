First of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this naturalistic documentary feature. It should be more correctly referred to as "Earth, 2009". Secondly, let me address the complaints of some reviewers who saw the TV series "Planet Earth" in 2006. <br /> <br /> I didn't see this TV series, but I learned here, that this film is the full length version of this 2006 TV series. I judge every movie, for its merits, not for its source. I judge the results alone, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really excellent. I reject this trivial complaint of some reviewers: it is simply an expanded version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". So? It doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> As a movie buff and one who has seen dozens of nature documentaries throughout my life, I was amazed and impressed by "Earth, 2009". This is the debut film of Disney's new "DisneyNature" division and follows in the footsteps of the pioneering nature documentary films and Academy Award winners of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There have been some other nature documentaries that have also distinguished themselves in these categories. What really distinguishes "Earth 2009" is its "purpose". It literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, it was obvious that this documentary film required a huge effort and amount of time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> It took three production companies to make this extraordinary documentary. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly recounts the stories of four species about their great migrations that pass through a year through the seasons starting in January and ending in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech special cameras were used for this film: one camera has a 360-degree computer-controlled motorized rotation of the lens and the other is an HD camera set to an amazing 1,000 frames per second. This shooting technique has really enriched the drama and beauty of some of the "Earth 2009" scenes, in particular the hunting of cheetah and large white sharks that jumped from the water to capture sea lions and an aerial view that exceeded the waterfall high in the world. There are many amazingly beautiful shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through film, soundtrack and narration, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a great soundtrack performed by the famous Berliner Philharmoniker, excellent creative and technical photography and the narration by James Earl Jones, I consider "Earth, 2009" the greatest documentary film on nature ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication have really paid off very well here. This film should be requested in all schools around the world. I expect an Academy Award for best documentary film, among other awards. Really an extraordinary documentary film, surprising, exhilarating and magnificent. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
