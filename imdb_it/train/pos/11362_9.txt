I think this is the most powerful film that HBO Pictures has ever made. This film should have been distributed in theaters to be seen by the public on the big screen. It is available on video so be sure to look for it and check it. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with directing and screenplay. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are impeccable. A masterpiece of the genre.
