I understand that this film is a debut film and as such is really impressive. It has the feel and rhythm of a "real indie", yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic, editorial, command and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. The shots are well framed and designed and serve to advance the story. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon present a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical "number by number" scripts. It's a story that needs the talent of the character of Judd Hirsch to have a chance to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to extrapolate nuances from the young actor into a role that could easily have been devalued by the stereotype or excessive approach. However, I found the film refreshing and fun.
