From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. He was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her ?! The show is not the same as before. His worst way. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can't replace someone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It's not right! The niece who replaced her is simply, ugh! Terrible. Does not fit the plot at all. He was one of the main characters, and his niece cannot replace her. She was a fantastic actress. Much better than the niece. Bring it back or you'll lose a number of spectators.
