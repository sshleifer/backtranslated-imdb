I first saw this compelling documentary in its initial version in 2001, and this had a profound effect on me, so much so that I annoyed many of my friends to see it with me in repeated screenings. The bottom line: none of my friends left disappointed (never!). This stellar film talks about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some absolutely beautiful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a declaration in the temporary state of everything?). We will see Goldsworthy create different works of temporary art, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as some pieces in the natural world. German director Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and modifies this meditation on the creative process which is a real treat for the eyes and ears (with an ambient musical score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally experimental spectral / noise guitar structured, as well as a group capable of musicians). Even if this film has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a cinema that highlights a revival of this beautiful film, try anyway (it is easily a film composed for the big screen, with a system competent audio to really experience this movie in the right way). No MPAA evaluation, but it contains nothing to offend (unless the birth of a sheep on the screen is intended to offend or disturb)
