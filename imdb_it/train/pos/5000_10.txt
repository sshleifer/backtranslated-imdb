Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least would have had the chance to have its complete series of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that the American public (apparently) has the attention span of a gnat when it comes to humor that does not consist of stringent diatribes of swear words, or has a concern for the scatological functions (both sounds and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that, however exceptional it was, it was meant for a rarefied audience that knew what to expect, but it was seen by an audience and a meeting room that had no idea what they were looking at. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show, even if it had been produced for the direct release of DVDs. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich in sub-context and there were other conversations just waiting to be under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations occur only in my mind.
