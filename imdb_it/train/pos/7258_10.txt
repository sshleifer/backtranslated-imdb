I was lucky enough to have a copy of this movie on DVD recently and now I've seen it for the second time. The first time was on TV late at night in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and desolate film .. <br /> <br /> Not many people love this film because it's so unconventional - the data that there is almost no dialogue spoken in this move - we only hear the thoughts of the characters - it's just an unconventional aspect of this. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this film, I discovered that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, was not stored on any British TV or film archives, was never released on video or DVDs and TV networks around the world destroyed it after their copyrights had run out in the 1980s. When first shown on TV in Australia, there were no consumer recordable devices. <br /> <br /> In the second recent review, I could understand why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, much like a play by Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Once again, if anyone wants a DVD copy of this, write to me and I'm sure we can work on something Greetings Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
