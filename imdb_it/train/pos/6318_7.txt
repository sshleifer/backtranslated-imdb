I had tried to rent it on many occasions, but I was always with the girl, who usually refuses robbery shots and comedies with the comment "Umm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie." so in the "Almighty Solo Movie Night"! <br /> <br /> However, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather funny film. While in the end it is quite forgettable, it has moments of fun and some resound strong moments. I was not used to the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule you watch movies trying to ignore that fact and still look at them for their merits. George Clooney stages a humorous and short cameo as a safe cracker with wheels that, for the most part, left me to ask myself two things ... 1. it would not be better any comedy if Mr. Clooney performed a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash away? The cast, all good actors in their own right, did a great job and one gets the impression that they had fun working together, which is quite important in a film like this. Needless to say, everything does not go as planned in this film, both in terms of plot and humor, but it made me check out the special features and consider looking at the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this for a good time, maybe get some friends and a pizza. you'll have fun. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's nice to hear the little appreciated Paul Conte used, and he let me sing fragments of the score long after the credits were launched.
