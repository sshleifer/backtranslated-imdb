This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I saw the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space". The same as they did with the first film, but with other episodes. But anyway, it's a pretty good movie. Only the ending is strange (don't see what happens with the Pegasus). But I still think it's good enough. The actors and special effects were good. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Protagonists: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
