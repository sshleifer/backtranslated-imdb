This low-budget digital video film has strengths in the right places: writing and acting. Moreover, digital photography is the best so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic tone of video shading prevails, but, surprisingly, it rivals the film in terms of brightness, clarity and saturation in light situations. This is a basic film that gives its best with snappy dialogues that bring a sort of "Midnight Cowboy" story about beggars who do whatever it takes to survive in the city of San Francisco.
