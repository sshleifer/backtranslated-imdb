I remember Parker Posey in "As The World Turns" before he became the queen of independent films. In this film, Posey shows his potential as a high-level actress. In this film with the supporting cast including Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street, who aspires to become a teacher. The supporting cast is a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and the only family relative like Judy, the librarian who is old-fashioned, dedicated and in menopause. Posey while Mary learns that she must grow and mature. Losing her position as a library clerk makes her realize how much she misses her in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City before she was refined with the yuppies. This movie is good enough for an independent and I came to enjoy Parker Posey like Mary and other characters from other movies.
