This extraordinary independent Argentine film is one of the best of 2000 in all of South America, including Argentina, which has produced a surprising number of quality films since 1999. Only in 2000, Argentina released many quality films, which have broken Argentina BO record. Half a dozen have been internationally acclaimed, like this one, at major world film festivals. After seeing this film, you can see how the Argentine home-made films managed to win back 20% of the national film market last year. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of the best Argentine directors, Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of globalization around the world, but underlines its impact on Argentina, and in particular on the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is as wonderful as the nice Jewish boy, trying to survive and even succeed in today's economic climate. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors of Hispanic cinema around the world, is as perfect as Simon, the Jewish father, as is the rest of the cast, which includes Spanish and Italian stars. <br /> <br /> Many current themes in Western urban societies are explored, I don't have enough space to go into details. Daniel Burman cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters that personify different dilemmas. If this movie plays at a festival near you or on video, don't miss it!
