"The Godfather" of television, but apart from his acclaimed characters and gangsters, the two are not equal. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist discovers that Tony is actually a part of two families: in a family he is a loving father and not yet so perfect, and in the other family he is a ruthless joker. After the analysis, dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually stem from his mother Livia, who is suspected of having a borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand are not equally recognized for their equally talented performances, respectively as psychiatrist and mother. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (of the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and faithful. Chianese, the only recurring actor to have appeared in a Godfather film, plays Tony's uncle and nemesis "outside and inside". Many fans have also appreciated characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "ok" but not worthy of note (except for the extraordinary performance of Iler in the penultimate episode, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are not convincing and exaggerated, but the show is too strong to hold them back. Even if the show continues for over six seasons, it ceases to have a boring or predictable time. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
