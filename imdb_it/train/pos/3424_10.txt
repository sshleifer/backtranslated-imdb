The information contained in this film is rather familiar to many who are paying attention to the news lately. Walter Reed's scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our wounded heroes on their return. <br /> <br /> What this film shows further is a truth common to all wars. The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when they return to civilian life. They are not only changed or influenced, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with them since they do not know each other. <br /> <br /> Finally this film shows what the army does to our young people in women to prepare them for war and the policies and practices they must follow in pursuing the war that leads to all psychological traumas. <br /> <br /> We have over 3,000 soldiers dead in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer physical and psychological traumas for life because of this war. No matter which side you are on, you should know the cost of the war to decide if we should be in that business. This film perfectly illustrates the costs for men and women.
