Just as the new BSG was not what the fans of the original series expected, Caprica may not provide what the new BSG fans expected (for the most part). It is a very interesting show, even if not entirely autonomous, or at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the big CGI shivers of the (new) BSG, you will be sorely disappointed. If you enjoyed the drama, you will probably find something you like and maybe even identify yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot examines how the Cylons were developed, because Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. Writers also manage to deal with humans who interpret God (i) "and the creation or re-creation of" human "life. It will be interesting to see how it works. <br /> <br /> I found it in some places and too preaching in others, but all in all it was promising. A small part of me wishes (or hopes) that there may be some small scents of BSG (apart from the background I mentioned), but this would probably contort the plot too much. As a BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me, but it's too early to tell. <br /> <br /> It would be really easy to create it as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but I'm willing to give it a possibility. Overall, I thought it was interesting enough to show me how the current series is before "throwing the (proverbial) towel."
