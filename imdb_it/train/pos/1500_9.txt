Nowadays, many people don't watch classic films like this. Most friends only watch films from the 90s to today. This is a bit stingy. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Just because, when these films were designed and implemented, this was when the ideas were fresh. Now people are striving only to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the film. For true fans of the classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator who investigates the disappearance of a film actor and encounters three other strange episodes with residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say more, because I will ruin the film more than I have already done. But it's a fantastic film as old as it is. And I wouldn't mind watching it again!
