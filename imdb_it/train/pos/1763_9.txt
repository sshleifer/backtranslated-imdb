this is one of the funniest movies I've seen. he had raw moments, but they were full of charm. it's Altmanesque's script, brilliant physical humor and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life that many of us can relate to. and I can honestly say that I feared for Steve Carell's nipple ... really. Surprisingly, this is a good-natured and no-frills comedy that essentially concerns the love and the many relationships in which we can find ourselves along the way. Catherine Keener was as exceptional as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but funny and very funny. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is an exhilarating metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
