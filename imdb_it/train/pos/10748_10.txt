I have to say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to deal with the devastation. I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channeled on TV if we talked about the towers. I was sick of hearing him say it. When it was broadcast on TV one year and a day later, I was shouting at the top of my lungs. It was the first time I cried from the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I watch it now on TV, 5 years later, and I'm still crying for the tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only videos of the first plane that hits the tower is surprising. It was an accident and look where he got them. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
