'' The 40 Year Old Virgin '' 'made me laugh a lot. I don't care if you consider it a very sexual comedy, I liked many of the jokes and scenes featured in this movie. Steve Carell is as perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has the hair on his chest removed from the wax is one of the most beautiful, especially because it's real. By the way, many of the actors and actresses featured in this film are well known or already famous. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a quiet life. It's a bit weird and it collects a lot of toys, but it looks harmless. One day, as they play poker with his friends at work, they discover that Andy is actually ... virgin! And he's already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to put Andy to sleep with a woman ... the problem is the confusion in which Andy enters, especially now that he's really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when he was buying DVD player in the shop where you work.
