maybe I need to have my head examined, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. The CG is not bad. I've seen worse. The appearance of creatures (and by creatures I mean the good and the bad snake) was the action scenes involving snakes were really good, I thought. Sometimes there are some errors in logic, and history doesn't always make sense. But for a creature characteristic, there are many worse things. A lot of the other creatures seemed to be raised by other films, so it's not entirely original. I believe the essence of the story is original. There is a bit of resemblance to Godzilla (the American version of the Big Budget) that he really enjoyed. like this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. I also liked music. All in all, I think Dragon Wars is a 7/10
