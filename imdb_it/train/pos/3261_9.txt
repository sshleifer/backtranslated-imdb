Nay Sayers of this film is probably embittered by unrequited love. This is a great movie for anyone able to understand the Johnny Mathis song, or any song of that era: Bobby Darin, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz's, Ipanema's girlfriend, and others ... < br /> <br /> I measure the films of how many times I have to watch them before I am satisfied ... Probably they made me come back quite a few times. <br /> <br /> I also look at the synergy between the cast .. I thought they worked well together. <br /> <br /> Open your heart and let the film's comic magic carry you. <br /> <br /> 'Alan
