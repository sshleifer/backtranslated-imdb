Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, obscure and done thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who ties his two sons by participating in wild ax murder, claiming that the victims are not human but "demons" and who were chosen by God to destroy these "demons". All this is told in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) to the FBI skeptical agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> Difficult to automatically forget this movie; better than most serial killer features, it's a compelling and scary story told in a simple way with a minimum of film tricks. Paxton, commendably, barely shows any blood until almost the end. Well played by everyone, especially the two minor actors (Jeremy Sumpter of the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary of "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I deduced any point is because I can understand that some people might find this hard to digest. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
