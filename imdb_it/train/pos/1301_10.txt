I loved all of Cream's work, even though there is a catalog of work that is so small and precious to take root. Even when they last twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad from Wheels of Fire are the first examples) they continue to shake the stockings of more than half of any rock act given today. This power to freeze on stage is given one of the most anticipated meetings of the rock band ever with their performances at the Royal Albert Hall last year. They could be aged, as well as their fans, but the energy is still there, with the arrangements of the classic blues tunes and theirs. The interpretations of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, do not seem to miss a beat. Clapton's solos have a line-up that he sometimes doesn't have when he's on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, quite said. Jack Bruce is quite robust in his voice yet with a kind of power that Clapton could never get by himself. In conclusion, if you want to see what the best shows you wanted to see last year were (well, some might have seen them), it's all on this DVD, with fantastic special features.
