If I was familiar with the theater production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the film, I might not love him like me. Although in all honesty, I will probably still like the production of the film thanks to my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, even if he is rather the actor, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.) <br /> <br /> As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and even though the voice of Isabel Bingley exceeds that of Jean Simmons, it's not more pleasant. I find it has a rather acute quality. Jean Simmons' voice is much more realistic, although, let's face it, it's not always a big concern for musicals. Also the only time I noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal record was during his performance of "Luck Be A Lady" and only there because I had previously become familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find that Vivian Blaine's voice is much more pleasant in the film than it is on Broadway. And Sinatra's only voice would be able to redeem the faults of everyone else, if they really needed redemption. (They weren't) It's infinitely better than Sam Levene's, particularly in my favorite song, "Sue Me". <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the lament that many songs have been omitted from the film for the lower songs, let me disagree. 'A Bushel and a Peck' is certainly not a jewel and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa' and its accompanying performance is more material than Hot Box. Personally I don't really care about 'Marry the Man Today' and I'm glad it wasn't included in the film, I love "I've never been in love before" and although it wasn't sung in the film, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in the dressing room of Adelaide. In Love'es expresses the same feeling equally well and probably in a range that both stars could reach more easily, and the film would not be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included on Broadway. the soundtrack of the film was available for sale, I would recommend buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the protagonist of the film actors. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story is fascinating as always and the acting and the son do not do it less than that
