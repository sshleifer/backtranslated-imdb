24 is the best television program !!!!! It's an incredible TV series with incredible suspense, excellent story lines and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best test. Because it is only the first episode, only the introduction, and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists. <br /> <br /> Jack Bauer is a federal agent who has been given the protection of Senator David Palmer. He cannot trust anyone because the CTU people may be involved. And when this happened, his daughter: Kimberly escapes from a party at a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want to see more, and more. <br /> <br /> It is only the first of the lot, and it is excellent.
