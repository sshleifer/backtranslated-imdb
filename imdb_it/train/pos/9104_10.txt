Well, I don't agree with the other published comment. Piedras is much much better than their Magnolia or the other films that have been mentioned. <br /> <br /> especially on non-real characters, I think someone just wrote it because he never lived in Spanish society like I did (and I'm not Spanish), it's a very real movie with real characters , very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses of Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> being a European film in contrast to an American film, well we are different companies, personally I don't like American American movies very much (I like the classics and some of Andy American's films but they are very few). <br /> <br /> It's a movie about a person's ongoing Constitution, liked it or not, we all make mistakes, but some can learn the mistakes.
