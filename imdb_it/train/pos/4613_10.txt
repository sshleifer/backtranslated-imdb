This film has one of the most mushy plots I've ever seen. For me, this is what makes it so great! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they got in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they worked wonderfully "comically" together. I wish Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, would have had more involvement in the plot. He showed he could do the comedy in the original series, but it was mostly wasted on this movie. This film is also played by the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think a better job could have come out of that.
