The paradoxes of time are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. They are fun to consider in an "What if?" somehow. Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and a series of films and television including "Star Trek: First Contact", the trilogy "Back to the future", "The excellent adventure of Bill and Ted", "I start from chief "and Homage Stargate SG1, 'Opportunity window'. "All You Zombies" by Heinlein was written decades ago, but for the first time people will read that story. <br /> <br /> In the case of the excellent film by Terry Gilliam, "12 Monkeys", it is difficult to determine what the problems of continuity could be with respect to the elements of the plot that want us to re-think our conception of the film . Repeated visualizations will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the film for the first time, will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as "the continuous torment of the experience" visited on him by time travel. <br /> <br /> Unlike other time travel stories, "12 Monkeys" is not clear if the future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER it was postponed in 1996, in his personal chronology. > <br /> This too could be interpreted as an event that had to happen in a single temporal universe, in order to ensure that the timeline is not altered ... Cole must die before the eyes of his young car for destiny by to achieve. If so, time is like a fluid, always finding its own level or path, regardless of the external forces that work there. It prevents the mind from dwelling too much on this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> If you can change the future events that then drive the actions of those who have the power to send people back in time, how we see the plane on board at the end of the film, so that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events ... or does it? The film probably led to a lot of drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> The DVD bonus material makes the view very interesting. Gilliam was subjected to more than normal pressures to bring the film under budget, which is not particularly surprising after the debacle of "Munchausen" and in the light of his subsequent attempt to film "Don Quixote". I consider the documentary "making of" one of the most interesting I've seen. It is certainly not a lime and accurately observes the difficulties and the occasional conflicts that arise between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his "7 Â½", due to the fact that the film is written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really "his" film - does not do the film justice. <br /> <Brad Pitt's portrait of Goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not particularly nice. Watch his slightly cross-eyed look in one of the scenes of the asylum. It is disturbing and distracting. <br /> <br /> Probably a coincidence, the song by Louis Armstrong "What a Wonderful World" was used at the end of both the "12 Monkeys" and the final episode of the TV series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 'Both the film and the television series were also featured by British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br/> "12 Monkeys" is a science fiction story that will engage in the same way that the mental stimulation of a Chess game could entertain. It's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure.
