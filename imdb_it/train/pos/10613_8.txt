This is a gem of long lost horror with Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to find a copy of this film, but it's worth it. This film is creepy but at the same time of cheese. It seems that 3 young newswomen (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover a festival when there is a hitch that involves their hotel room and seek refuge in the home of Earnest Keller ) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie lags behind, feeling bad, while the other 2 are out to film their story. She is soon killed at home, in a VERY poor way by an unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the lid of the vent while it crashes on her while being dragged into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is killed in an even more brutal way by having her face slammed through the vent cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?) Lover in a rather boring sub-plot and when she returns home, her guests (who we have now discovered are brother and sister and that whatever is in the basement is their son) come up with a plot to try to kill her as well. Virgina does not completely agree with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer, but is tricked into going to the basement where he meets Junior. Here the film becomes almost comical as Junior (played hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient man, whose actions and movements will cause some chuckle even if it should be scary. This is where the rhythm of the film resumes and the ending is well done. The actors / actresses do a terrific job with the material in particular Lassick, Furst and Bach and even if it's not the most terrifying film that has ever been made, it's very funny!
