Every time I see Nicole I like it better. I love a movie like this. A woman who simply does not give up, but continues to break your heart. The first film I remember seeing was Of Human Bondage, Kim Novak's version - Laurence Harvey. The steaks about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anyone else who can't speak Russian, I'm sure. Strange how people miss the point. Even the Russian no-goodnik boys were well launched. In the end, I have to tip Ben Chaplin to his hat, as someone else noticed, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was certainly some warmth between him and Nicole. To think, the kids paid for it, amazing.
