This is a simple and ghostly ghost story. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie club, and they were enchanted to the end! No blood or blood, just good old suspense. It starts from the beginning, and builds and builds. The ending is a real breakthrough that took me by surprise. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well acted. It is also a "period piece" - set in the 1920s - which added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I received Susan Hill's book from Amazon. The film follows the book quite closely. <br /> <br /> It's a shame not to be readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories I've ever seen. Which shows that a little creativity surpasses every day "in the face"!
