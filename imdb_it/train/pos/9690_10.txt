Paulie was cute, funny, funny and quite satisfying. I went to this film expecting to see a typical "family" movie, one that in a few moments would have found me unconscious and drooling on the floor. My mindframe changed immediately when I was quickly fascinated by the healthiness of the film. It is rare to find a film for families that is complete and can be coined "healthy". Most are cheap, written and produced to attract young family members, which will then drag the unfortunate elders into a mind that numbs 65 minutes of overworked gags and textures. Oh yes, Paulie had a track. He told the story of a girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie, the parrot, who incredibly could talk and talk to her quite often. Marie's idiotic father found this incredible and thought that Paulie was harmful to the mental health of his 4-year-old daughter, and quickly separated them. We follow the adventures of Paulie (and misadventures) as he tries to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Oh yes, Paulie could really speak (intelligently) and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cold. The plot was dense and fun, and it always attracted me. Paulie is the best family film I've found and I loved it with all my heart. Never. Seriously. Grab a copy and sit down and enjoy a real family movie with the whole family. Do not sleep. I promise.
