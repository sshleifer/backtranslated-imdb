Some movies you know you will like from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Drawing its roots in "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 1940s - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 1990s. Nick Cage plays the main character of the "bad luck" who gets caught up in a plot of murder of husband and wife - and his luck goes from bad to worse even more when he tries and tries to get away from the people, the city, the violence threat of Red Rock West. A lot of twists, great performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic musical background with slide guitar and a seamless direction make this a real joy. Favorite line: when Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the running car, he shakes his head and says, "F *** in the" story of my life ".
