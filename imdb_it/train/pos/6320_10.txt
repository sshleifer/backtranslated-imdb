The main reason I wanted to see this film was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is something incredible without really seeing it. But this film caught me off guard. It was not what I expected. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember that I couldn't stop laughing !!! And it wasn't just the cast that did it for me. The script was written in a surprising way. Whenever you expected something to happen, it didn't happen. There were so many twists, but it matched the whole tone of the movie instead of coming out as pretentious. Photography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful. I can't really say anything bad about this movie! However, I would like Andrew Davoli to have a little more screen time!
