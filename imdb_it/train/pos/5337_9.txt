It could be the remake of the 1987 Autumn Tale, after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel uses rock music as a medium in this film to express her personal attitude towards life, in which love, desire and consequent frustration play crucial roles. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the deep feeling, and yet it is not too inappropriate to use it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than the ordinary one. The director focuses on the representation of the subtle affection and final vanity of life rather than on simple rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is delivered with delicacy and tact through the beautiful exhibition. Mabel does not attempt to embellish rock musicians as artists, instead, she tries to reproduce a real life on the screen, making enormous efforts of years of work on this project and gathering information in Beijing's underground pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel has probably given the best performance in all his films made so far. His innate opposition and reticence is perfectly suited to the film's blue mood.
