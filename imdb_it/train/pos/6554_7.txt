OK here's what I say: <br /> <br /> The film was excellent. I'm a big fan of Nancy and I read all the original books 1-56 and kept reading more. I am now in 96. Beware of the bad guys who give this film a lower grade than it should have. All the clues indicate a wonderful film! I loved everything So what Nancy is in current time. It's still antiquated like it's in books! People who haven't read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's sight. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the spectral film. I loved the exciting car chases and escaped. I loved the clues. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you go see it since the people who complain don't know anything about A which movie is good and B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. It may not be worthy of an Oscar but it's really a good movie.
