This game is fantastic. Really, you should take it if you don't have it. Even though it is ancient it was great now when it came out. I believe this game will always be a classic. It is also a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I sat and played this game for hours trying to beat it, which we eventually did. It's not as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a Mario fan friend it's essential. It's fun and challenging fun. Everything you could want from a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well, it came out in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
