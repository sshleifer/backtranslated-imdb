Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The film has had a great story. I loved it! Since I saw that movie, I've been stuck in the eighties and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the film was when his father died and was collecting all his musical compositions, and the Apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his ears in his hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more romantic. Even Murphy Brown did a great job in the film, he acted like him. I'm so glad I saw this movie. The beautifully sung Purple Rain song was so heartfelt. I cried more than once.
