This fabulous film must be seen knowing that millions of people have scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the sad economic conditions of the 1930s. Remember, 10 cents bought a loaf of bread then, so this was a minor luxury for many people. It is the testimony of how Hollywood has done its best to make the United States feel a little better about itself. You will notice that with the Hollywood study system at that time many actors and actresses had been placed in similar films, eg. James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. Moreover, the branches of the American army have always been respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of the precision military march of the great choreographer, Busby Berkeley, in the end.
