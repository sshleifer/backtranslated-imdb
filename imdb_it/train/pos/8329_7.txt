A solid film, if not exceptional. Matthau, like Einstein, was wonderful. My favorite part, and the only thing that would get me out of my way of seeing it again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to recover the bird.
