I really liked this movie is dark, it's not a dodged bullet, car tracker numbing your brain action movie. many of the characters' backgrounds and motivations are rather vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a film in which the director allows the viewer to make his own minds. <br /> <br /> in the end, motivated by love or revenge, or a desire to repent, do what you feel is "right". "Will God ever forgive us for what we have done?" - it is not a question mortal men can answer - so does what he feels he has to do, what he is good at doing, what he has been trained to do. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor - I honestly can't think of a bad movie he made - and he has a great supporting cast. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
