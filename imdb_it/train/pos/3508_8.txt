Incredibly intriguing and captivating, I found it impossible to get away once I started watching. I am usually one of the most severe critics, but for me this film was simply brilliant, strange as it might seem that I could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the places. <br /> <br /> From a cinematographic point of view I thought that there was a great use of light and consistency. From the orange glow of the summer light to the plastic-covered sofa everything had a distinct air of realism to me. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the character I thought of the notion of Victor Vargas as almost the glue connecting the story was very inspired, each of the other members of the family had a more complete background, but caused more intrigue in the main character himself. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, having met someone just like my grandmother and having been from the point of view of such a situation, I can say that the situation turned out to be particularly realistic. The embarrassment, the accent, the kitchen and even the comments made seemed to me so authentic. I think this film worked for me because I started looking at it without expectations and found it completely immersed and brought back memories of teenage emotions, it's worth watching.
