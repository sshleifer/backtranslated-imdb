This is a fantastic fantasy film. One of my favorites, it's really cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who directed Candyman, who made a great start with this film. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl named Anna who falls ill with glandular fever during her eleventh birthday. Draw a house on a piece of paper from his notebook and fall into a dream where the house is real. Every subsequent dream he has is altered by the presence of anything he adds to the photo. In his third dream he meets a guy he thinks he created called Mark. He makes friends with him and their relationship gets stronger as the dreams get darker and scarier. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke who plays Anna is a terrifying actress and it is very strange that, after just one movie, she should disappear and never be in anything again. <br /> <br /> Even the score of Hans Zimmer is an ace. Much like Broken Arrow, the music is spooky and mysterious. It's a shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
