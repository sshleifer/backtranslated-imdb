I'm going to keep this review short and sweet .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer for this and thought I'd give it a 5 minute vortex and my initial thoughts were "what the hell is this?" But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 I was collecting the jaw from the floor. This film is a great example of how different a film can be, and it is also French. This film is a real pleasure for the artistic eyes wrapped in an elegant futuristic film noir package, the motion capture is very intelligent and the animation style in black and white that does not have the gray although it did not initially for me totally fascinated end of the film and I found myself wishing that every movie was made this way. I think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing, it would have been very easy to ruin it if they hadn't landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters (just look at any Hong Kong legends movie in English to see an example perfect) I gave it 9 even though I gave it an extra 2 because of how everything looks fresh and new ....
