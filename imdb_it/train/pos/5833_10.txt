I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. This is Laural and Hardy. Lighten up already. These two were a riot. Their comic genius is as fun today as it was 70 years ago. Not a dirty word from both mouths and they were able to keep the public in a daze. Their play was not sophisticated anywhere. If a straw pillow can't make you smile, there's no reason to look at any of the things these guys did. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at funny things without a plot. I guess it takes a simple mind to appreciate this stuff, so I qualify. The two-man comedy teams don't calculate, we're too sophisticated ... Aren't we lucky?
