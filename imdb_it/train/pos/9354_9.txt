As someone who never tolerated Adam Sandler in terms of talent, as was done to him and many comedians like him, I joined Reign Over Me expecting a great movie, not only for his presence in the film, but because I thought which looked very good overall. Even someone who has already thought that Sandler could offer an effective dramatic performance is to write here that I was surprised by how fantastic it is. It will make you cry, especially in his intentionally sudden and unexpected monologue. The amazing thing about his role is that he is a difficult character to say that we have seen before. We have seen many emotionally scarred characters, many mentally retarded people, many loners, many passionate self-centered artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is none of these. He can get a taste of each of them in some way, but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It is a joy for the audience to be emotionally attracted to him and to be pulled in every way by someone whose problems, mentality and provocations are completely different from most characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle offers an interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal person in the world, to the point that you will hardly find many characters like his, or at least those who are interpreted in the way he plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant in the fact that he is funny, excited, intelligent and stupid as so many normal people are. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who have done almost nothing in very small but rather colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the wife of the refined upper middle class, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is Sandler's desensitized father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something very profound about the wonders of communication in all its forms. It is much thinner than, say, Babel, and has an ideal much closer to home. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of its images compared to simple style. This film struck me as a kind of reference to the 1970s kitchen style. The cinematography was grainy and graceless, but that was its charm. It was not a matter of attracting us to the camera itself and to the brilliance that would have diluted its stories with this. <br /> <br /> Music, which plays an important role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. At first, you feel like you're in some sort of soundtrack on Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine, but you soon realize you're in it for something more. In fact, the film is full of a lot of music that stimulates many of the most exciting scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is an important statement not only for the company but also for the film itself. It goes to show that even Blankman's director is capable of prodigies.
