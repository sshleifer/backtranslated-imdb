I can't say that this film is a disappointment because I read some reviews before looking and it didn't work as I thought. The bar was not set so high, so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The city of New York. If you live in cities like me, you will recognize certain places and you will understand that the city should be more than an environment, rather one of the main characters. There are sincere moments, funny conversations and twists to the left and right that make everything interesting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: the first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let them want more" of fashion. Of course the good scenes / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are a lot of skits that fall into the "in-between" category, too many indeed, which is what ultimately brings the movie down. Furthermore, the diversity of New York City, although suggested by the many distant pans in the city and mentioned in a conversation during the film, is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing justice to the city. For example, many of the sketches also affect middle-aged whites. I mean, I know that the city is home to many of the aforementioned demographics but come on, the plot of Paris Je'taime and its diversity of characters make New York City look like Lancaster, PA or a really white place. It is simply disappointing to see the city handed down on its heritage like that. <br /> <br /> Yet, even after saying this, I would recommend giving New York, I Love You a view. Who knows, maybe you won't agree with my opinion and maybe you won't. You'll never know until you see it alone. This review is not intended to prevent anyone from watching this film, as everyone's opinion of art is different. I'm just giving you a rough idea of ​​what to expect.
