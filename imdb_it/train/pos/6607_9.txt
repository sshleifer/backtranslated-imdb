I would give almost 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts and sections that lack leadership, which damages the flow / continuity of the film. The plot is large and well composed; you will surely want to look at it calmly to fully understand it. The characters are complicated and so is the plot, they expect to receive only enough information to stop scratching their heads, it is a film in which everything is explained at the end. The animation is exceptional and the combination of femme fatale and film noir translates into a great film that is unlike anything else I've seen in animation. It's a black and white film and its silent darkness in some scenes, so it's worth watching it on a good T.V or plasma. The voices of the characters save this film in its English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that its success in Paris, I liked much more in French with English subtitles. One as a whole is worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally if you liked this movie you might also like it; Waking Life & Ghost in Shell 2 Innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
