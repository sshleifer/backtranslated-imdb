Summary: Zandalee is a young woman who increasingly feels trapped in her marriage to Thierry. Thierry himself is grappling with his father's death the previous year and has lost his way. He immersed himself in the work, in the writing of his writings, and Zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them. This is where Johnny enters, and old friend of Thierry, who were once exiled artists together. But Johnny continued to paint and has just a day's work to rent. He takes the day that comes and leaves tomorrow for his destiny. There is an immediate attraction between Zandalee and Johnny, and they enter into a relationship. But Zandalee struggles with his lust to desire, his conscience and his love for her husband. But none of them, not Zandalee, neither Johnny nor Thierry can prevent relations between them from going out of control. <br /> <br /> Comments: It is set as a thriller. But perhaps more a heart thriller than a normal thriller in which we talk about life or death and threats of violence. Not that a heart thriller can't take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different perspective. And it's not really until the second half of Zandalee until the thriller emerges, and although the foundation for it is expected in the first half, I can't describe the genre as a thriller. Much more than a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. The developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a bit of a sensual erotic type. Because that's what this is about, what drives the characters and therefore the whole story. Desire. The need to have, and the need to be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it is quite good, definitely much better than its current (4.1) rating however. It takes time, but a good sense of suspense grows, and manages the erotic part very well, with taste. It's always an integral part of the story, it had to be there to give the story the necessary weight, and I never thought it was an excuse to show naked breasts or something. But unfortunately the climax of the story arrives well before the end, and the end itself seems rather flat, albeit in its own way, a bit dramatic. <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive, led by well-known actors such as Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show was almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very adept at reciting the sometimes subtle feelings of desire, she excels that both Cage and Reinhold sometimes make a bot overboard and get a little rough. His career later is too subtle for the talent he shows in Zandalee, I can only hope that it is because of his choices. Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give an extra touch to the film, are Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> When you're in the mood this is a very nice movie, you could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves. <br /> <br /> 7/10
