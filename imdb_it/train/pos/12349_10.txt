this movie only shows that you don't need big explosions, billions of dollars of computer graphics or highly paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is an excellent plot and plot. that the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa, pulls off brilliantly. I recommend this film to everyone who loves an epic piece. and for those who love Kurosa there were previous works. 10/10
