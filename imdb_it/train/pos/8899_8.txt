What the film of the 60s really represents (for those of us who in those years growled in the belly of America) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated and stereotyped characters, the genuineness of the problems remains clear. <br /> <br /> It was not only times of radical change, but also very confusing times. Two fundamental things changed our world then: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the enormous influence of the media. These two new freedoms have initiated social changes that soon became institutionalized. Sensitivity is born of chaos, values ​​derive from disorder. Keep in mind, however, that most Americans were not involved in this ... they worked, they played, they saw the news ... and they were slowly influenced by minority efforts and struggles ... civil rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, the war on poverty ... <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television in particular has been well reflected, even if the conflict between the the attitude of the general public and those who tried to change things were at best ignored ... and in the worst case, misrepresented. Middle-class Americans were not all around with baseball bats or their rebellious daughters. They too were confused. Let's not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers and how the Beatles began an assault that killed the Folk-Protest movement. There are no Beatles songs in the film, or even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think that if you didn't live the decade, you might not have an idea of ​​what the film is, the image is a bit weak. At one point I held a steady job while my sister lived on the Hog Farm and went to Woodstock. At one point I was in Haight Asbury and the Detroit Riots while working and playing the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles change constantly. <br /> <br /> The film describes three brothers from a middle-class family. They represent the hippie child, the political activist and the active military personnel. Dad represents typical attitudes and the mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance and, sometimes, compromise ... for the sake of peace. <br /> <br /> The Black family includes a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I assume that the producers knew all the variables and had to be content with limitations, otherwise the film would have become a long, boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message to today's young people. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems, and also how problems divide us ... The 60s were unusual in that way, and only the roaring 20s compare. In other words, this film has a moral after all. In the end, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put this on your list of oxymorons. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a Guru or a free-spirited genius in the 1960s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever nail the 60s in the lower right ... it was too varied (this film is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed, that we have learned and grown from it, and that for once, a generation has shaped and changed America ... for the better.
