I loved this movie since I was young! It's excellent. Although it could be a little too much for the average movie observer if you can't interpret certain subtleties of the film (for example, the name of our hero is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alessandro he is shot in the heel with a rocket, just like Achilles in mythology was shot in his heel). This is just a small fact that is fun! Anyway, great movie, good story, it would be nice to see it redone with today's special effects! Strangely, Gary Graham had an average success, starring in the T.V. show Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
