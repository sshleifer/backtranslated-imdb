An inventive and suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that poses a tough challenge being entirely set in two rooms. Not completely successful, but tense, surprising and well acted. Could you find the movie that somehow resembles SAW ?? two men trapped in the room and opposing each other ?? but unlike that movie, he dares to stick with his premise and keep the hero locked up in his cell throughout the film. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Some may find the suspense contained to be tedious, but this reviewer found it compelling. The sound and images of the film are surprisingly well made. This is certainly a good movie to use to showcase a good home video system. Just for a night film festival, when one is in a paranoid mood. He certainly kept me awake that night.
