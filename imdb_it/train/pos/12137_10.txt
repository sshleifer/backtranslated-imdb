How amazing this movie is! I've seen it over and over again over the years and I'm always fascinated by it. The reason the film is so easy to review is, of course, the arresting performance of young Bette Davis. Not only does he steal every scene he finds himself in, but in reality he is much more beautiful and photographed here (not to say sexier) than he was in any of the movies he had done so far in his home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was produced by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those beautiful big eyes (especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in Soho in London). His body was so shapely when he was young. Get a load in the cheap dressing gown you wear for your explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, she's an absolute power in that scene. Howard is a little too nervous about everything, but he captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee marks the sweet and pretty Sally who really loves him. Max Steiner's score is both fascinating and moving. Splendid shows and thirties flavors make this version a must see of the classic novel.
