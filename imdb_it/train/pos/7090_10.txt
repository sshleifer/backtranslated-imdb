A linear journey within a non-linear structure. It is a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows through this trap between present, future and past. However, the linearity of the film cannot be avoided: it is the work of the projector itself, the development of the narration. <br /> <br /> What we can see at the base of the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this film by Terry Gilliam is a world with little space for free will. <br /> <br /> From the beginning we are informed about the prophecy of a schizophrenic, according to whom a plague would dominate the Earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> Cole's mission (Willis) is clear: to go back to the mid-1990s to investigate anything and anyone related to the release of the virus. There is no way to change the past: all that can be done is to gather information that can help scientists of the present (who, for us viewers, is the future) find the cure. Don't change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better. <br /> <br /> In his "returns" over time, Cole gradually approaches a surprising dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is obscure and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who elect "volunteers" (this word is incisively ironic) to undertake journeys to the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet achieved the highest level of time travel results and Cole ends up on wrong dates - this, later in the plot, will work as a test of his sanity for psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe). <br /> <br /> We can see, through the evolution of history, that linearity and non-linearity intertwine in a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment when the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climate - appears. It changes, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, which emerges in his dreams. <br /> <br /> At an airport, a man is killed while running, armed, to someone else. A blonde woman runs after the murdered one. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a child who visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of narration) and the future (adult Cole) In During the course of the narration, Cole has the feeling of having already experienced the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The firing officers prevent him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> What could not be changed. And, in Cole's case, what was is what will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A film not well understood by many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good films with a similar theme: The trilogy of Back to the future (which has another point of view on the character of the "mad scientist", and although he shares the atmosphere of decadence - in particular in the second film -, is much more optimistic than Gilliam's work, which is a strange image of Hollywood). <br /> <br /> In another register, there is "Wild Strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces, this involves an amazing and enlightening journey to the past through dreams and reminiscences. <br /> <br /> I've never seen "La Jet√©e", but only because I can't find it.
