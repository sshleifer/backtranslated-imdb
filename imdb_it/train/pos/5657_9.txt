I remember watching American gothic when it first aired, it occurred to me recently, all I could remember was the same guy who appeared in Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I don't watch TV much , but I looked at American gothic, bought the complete series on DVD this week, and it's still as good as ever, this is one of the best television series ever, the reason I don't watch much TV is because it's just garbage, except Derren Brown, it's all Reality TV or Soaps, like Grease, Big Brother etc., I'm sick of it, I got the complete series of American Gothic for Â£ 16.97 from the Asda website, which is the cheapest I can find.
