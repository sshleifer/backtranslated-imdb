This little-seen film is a languid and relaxed yellow. It moves away from some of the clich√©s of this kind and takes a more flexible approach. It's about a woman looking for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason. His research leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals. In true yellow style, murder is never far away. <br /> <br /> The cast is really quite good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat or 'Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80's scream queen). The lead actress is Rosemary Dexter, and although I'm not familiar with her, she does a good job of guiding the photo. <br /> <br /> One of the main features of Eye in the Labyrinth is its music. Unusually for a yellow it has a jazz-rock soundtrack. This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, recalls Miles Davis, in particular his work on In A Silent Way. It is an excellent soundtrack and gives this film a different look than most yellows. The groove fusion accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny scenario on the sea that the film is mostly composed. <br /> <br /> This is a mystery, so we really need to talk about the murder sets. Well, this film is a bit short in this sense. It is certainly not without them but they are few and far between. The opening of the dream-murder is probably the best offer besides a memorable sequence of burning cars. But this is not a particularly violent film. Still, I don't think it should disappoint too many fans of this genre. The mystery is quite compelling and has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy Saro and THIS supernaturally inappropriate accent dubbed?) And bizarre moments to satisfy; while the sleaze-factor is supported by a smattering of nudity. <br /> <br /> Eye in the Labyrinth sounds like a yellow version of an Agatha Christie mystery, since it presents a group of indifferent characters in a villa, all suspected of murder; we have the mandatory flashbacks that describe their connections to the last hours of the murder victim (highly unpleasant). Although this is not a degree: an example of this kind, it is certainly very attractive, as it does not borrow too much from other films of the subgenre. For fans of thrillers, I gave a thumbs up and hopefully one day gave a nice DVD transfer. Definitely worth the treatment.
