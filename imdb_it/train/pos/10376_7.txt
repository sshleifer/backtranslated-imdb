I just saw Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. The performance of Toby Malone really stood out, I found myself really attentive to what happens to Matt throughout the film, which is very funny, very calm with a good mix of well rounded characters, a fairly important result considering it is short duration time. There are also many good twists that will keep you guessed until the end. Other characters to watch are the crazy Tiny and the attractive Jesse. You may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than controlling it, you won't regret it. Have fun. 7/10
