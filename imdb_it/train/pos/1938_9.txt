The big bad swim has a low budget, an indie feeling about it. Many times I start watching independent films that have had excellent reviews only to discover that they are pretentious, voted by people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that the film is first and foremost a form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the big bad swim has a message or a higher meaning or metaphor, if it does then I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning BBS felt right, it was easy, warm and humane, there were no important dramas or significant insights, I only connected with the characters. And when, as in all good films, the end came I felt sad for the loss of that connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big, fast or insightful, watch a movie you are looking for deliver more than you can. BBS offers a solid, enjoyable, real experience and I felt gratified and satiated after seeing it.
