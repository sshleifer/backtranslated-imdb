Probably the best film of the year for me. This small French film focuses on the secretary of office Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days doing work of other men, uncredited, and is the source of their discussion of contempt and at lunchtime that she is fin too light, being partially deaf, she reads her lips. A change is set in motion when he takes on a new confinement with Paul (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, ties them together. Carla is attracted to Paul and the fact that it makes her feel attractive, so to speak, the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel his feelings because he needs his help. He owes money to a local gangster and plans to steal from him, which will mean Carl's ability to read his lips. I think the main thing that drives the film above a medium suspense / drama is the extraordinary harmony between the two stars. Throughout the film, regardless of the other characters on the screen, you can try this extraordinary bond between Carla and Paul. I can't remember when I witnessed such a sexual relationship between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for best actress). You never feel like you're looking at a piece of acting, this is really Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. It makes an unattractive character both attractive and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and in both times when I finished watching it I wanted to go back to the cinema and get back in touch with them.
