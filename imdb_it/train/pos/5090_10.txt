I loved this movie. Great plot and actors and good movie sets. He told the story in a way I can easily understand and pay attention without falling asleep. I'd like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can't find it anywhere. Please send me an email if you know where I can get the soundtrack. In addition to not being able to find the soundtrack, I thought the film was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is his best job. His previous films were OK, but this really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as one of the best TV movies ever broadcast. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a great job.
