It may be (or may not be) considered interesting that the only reason I checked this film in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (role of Best Oscar actor. (I would still given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I saw it, because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the film preached a bit, but not only I didn't mind, I liked the speeches and I was never bored with them. <br /> <br /> The acting was exceptional in this film, I particularly liked Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (rightly nominated for an Oscar ), Bette Davis (unjustly named), George Coulouris and, strangely, Eric Roberts, who plays the role of the average child.I really liked his character: a strange-looking boy who speaks like a philosopher, just u n crack, even the name of the characters (Bodo) is fun. <br /> <br /> The endin g, in which the character of Lukas was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons, worked for me too. I agreed that he felt he had to do what he did, and I understood why he couldn't explain it. The message this film makes is good and noble, the scenery (which means home) is beautiful and the acting is excellent. Watch this movie if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
