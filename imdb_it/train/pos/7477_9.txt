This film is composed of a great emotion, especially with its exceptional soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors for his enthusiasm for making movies and entertaining. This film was not the best the first time I saw it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and progresses through its lifestyle. He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). It goes through a state of depression and therefore an extrovert mixture of imagination. This film went beyond my expectations and is one of the best Cruise films ever!
