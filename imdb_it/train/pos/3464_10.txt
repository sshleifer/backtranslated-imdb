* WARNING * Spoiler forward ... The writers of this story knew these men very well. The actors likewise portrayed them very well. The result is that at the end of the film you feel like you're really looking at John Lennon and Paul McCartney. There are expected tensions, especially in difficult initial moments. But as the two begin to relax, the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well starts to show itself. The bitterness is still there, and sometimes interrupts, but when John has the idea of ​​bringing Lorne Michaels on his offer to pay the Beatles the sum of $ 3000 to appear on "Saturday Night Live", the two could be the i same boyish pranksters who terrorized Liverpool together as teenagers, and survived playing in Hamburg's rough nightclubs to get on the Superstar. But in the end, this fantastic fantasy guides us gently. We are reminded of why a Beatles meeting was probably never possible before the assassination of Lennon: the two driving forces of the group overcame each other.
