If you have children or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to break into the song every twelve minutes - then this is the Disney movie for you! My kids loved every minute of this movie, and I have to admit I laughed a lot over the film. There are no mushy songs that can hinder a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and fully identifiable. This should be considered one of the "classics" of Disney because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its endless excitement!
