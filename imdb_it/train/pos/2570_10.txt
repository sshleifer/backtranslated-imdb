Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen and I like it so much that I memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee broke the wind) and also with the script in my head I still like to watch it for Jerry Lee, that the German shepherd is hysterical and is actually being tested to see who is smarter. The tag line is also true. Not to mention the acting is great, although Christine Tucci plays in a different whisper (check the filmography under CSI if you don't know what I mean). Too bad this film only contained the single issue that Dooley and Jerry Lee were supposed to work with, it would have been nice to see the tricks of Zeus and Welles.
