This was a great movie! Even though there were only about 15 people including myself, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom liked it too. There were two middle-aged women there and a mid 20s there and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. I love the part where Corky and Ned both love Nancy and make her beautiful lol. And when his roadster arrives and Ned is there. Yes, this was a great film, even though people underestimated it. Go see it, I bet you'll like it !! I loved it too and my friend. <br /> <br /> People were so tough in this movie and they hadn't even seen it. I bet next time they will give the film and the actresses a chance. They did a great job in my opinion. But if you have small children it is still appropriate. I'll probably also take my 7-year-old niece to watch it.
