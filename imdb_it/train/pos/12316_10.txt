Ching Siu Tung's and Tsui Hark's A Chinese Ghost Story, as well as being one of the greatest Wuxia piano films ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an extraordinarily choreographed martial arts film that should belong to every collection movie lover. Hong Kong's sweetest superstar, Leslie Cheung, plays a itinerant tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple. During his stay at the temple, he meets a colorful cast of characters including the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Devil of the Tree and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the adorable Joey Wong. <br /> <To free her from the clutches of the evil tree devil, she must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> We can't say enough good things about this movie. The rhythm is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverish ending should leave you with little chance of breathing. The chemistry between the wonderful tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too soon) really allows the viewer to try for both. Actually the acting as a whole is so lively and full of life, I would say this is one of the funniest viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrait of the mysterious Yin Swordsman. His exaggerated personality of a disillusioned swordsman determined to defeat evil leads to great moments of humor and the traditional drama of HK. A marvelous soundtrack, lush cinematography with stunning colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung complete this wonderful film. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
