This short film was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish I had won it! Basically a jam session filmed by some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood has often embraced jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare aspect of the film in an impromptu deception. This has been added to the film preservation list and deservedly. TCM runs it periodically as a filler and runs it every month in March for its "31 Days of Oscar" tribute. From the center to the buzzer, hiss, nothing but net and the shot is so smooth, the net has just moved. More firmly and highly recommended !!!
