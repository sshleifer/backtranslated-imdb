This film kept me constantly entertained. Comparing this to Serial Mom, Mr. Waters has returned to his more gritty side. This is not so polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message on how success and fame change a person - but above all how people around you change. <br /> <br /> There is no fake moment in this film. <br /> <br /> the characters are a bit comic ... but I want to believe that this is what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating to observe how Mr. Waters evolved ... This is really his best work.
