I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see this. An intelligent, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I wasn't quite sure how a director could create "nothing", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals of C.O.R.E. to create another low budget set that looks real (real as nothing can be). It is worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see it, please go. You'll be glad you did.
