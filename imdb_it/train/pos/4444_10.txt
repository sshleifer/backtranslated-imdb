Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie because they have no connection with the first two Demon movies. And with the "Demon III" in the title, one might suppose he would do it. The problem is that this film was never designed to be part of the Demons series. Distributors have only a "Demon III" above the original title "The Orc" to collect the popularity of the other films. The new American DVD of this image has the title "Demons III: The Ogre" on box art but the film itself reads only "The Ogre". I don't know if the previous versions had the title "Demons III" on the film itself, but this new version seems to be just a small white lie. If you manage to get past the "Demons III" in the title, you could enjoy some fun in "The Orc". It starts with an insinuating introduction and remains quite insinuating everywhere. There is no gore and film of the film slowly, but I have still dug it. Don't expect it to be like the other Demon movies. I give "L'orco" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it.
