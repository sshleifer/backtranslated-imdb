As in Amelie, recent French films seem to take a stereotypical relationship between males and females, centered on a woman who finds her one true love. In this case, desperation leads to a convict, which leads to his evolution into a prototype of mobs. An intelligent and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, subtitles are a little fast, but not unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, as seems to be increasingly the case with European films, is exceptional and perfectly synchronized with the film's variations. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of various urban horror films. There's a Wes Craven in Chicago.
