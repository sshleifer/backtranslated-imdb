I loved this episode. It's so beautiful that all 5 of them come together and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are protagonist guests !!! I just hope Clark joins the Justice League and we'll get to follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested in what happens next. I think Chloe should also join the team as Watchtower, which would be something for her to do besides the Daily Planet, because she has no superpowers. Also, I want to find out what types of topics Lex will use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have !!!
