This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! The "dragon lord" (Jacky Chan) and his friend "cowboy" made the film fun, meaningful and simply silly. The film is a rare blend of a fight between good and evil and (somehow) the wonders and the fun that is growing. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so called because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which includes the implementation of intelligent and elaborate ways to escape the study (with the help from the whole family, including the tutor), competing in rather masculine (and idiotically interesting) ways to get the affection of a local girl, competing in "soccer" (you'll see what I mean) and the list could go on. Somehow they find themselves in the middle of a struggle to save the shipping of precious antiques and the lives of many people. <br /> <br /> The film has its important moments. But they do not depress, but rather inspire. The playfulness of the boys is not lost in this exchange, but in reality it is used against evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical comparison (which in itself was fantastic), but well, you'll see. Let me tell you that it really captures the spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> silly, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
