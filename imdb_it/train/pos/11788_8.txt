I really think people are taking the wrong approach in this. First of all, I find this short film very funny and interesting. I take it for what it is. I think the suspense and the mystery are brilliant in their insinuation on the observer. Another thing that struck me is that it immediately involves the viewer even if there is not a clear story, only hints, pauses and emotions interpreted by the characters that give you the impression that there is a story for everything that is going forward. No one else could have done it better than Lynch. This is the essence of Lynchianism at its best. Of course, I will agree with anyone that people who begin to see it with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work on the spectator's side will find themselves disappointed. It is good. Lynch is not about this. At least this side of Lynch is not. What helped make the Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is at full capacity here and the people who just expect to be entertained as if they were looking at something else simply don't understand what it is. My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (image, sound, situation) with which you react instinctively. It's not about pleasure of any kind, it's about getting the reaction you want. And this, my friend, is pure art.
