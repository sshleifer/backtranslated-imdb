Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can't help but think that the brain side of Tom Robbins's book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in the translation on the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and talented towers. Ultimately even if this didn't work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or that the plot and content did not become alive. It's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when we read a book like this. We are taken away in another time and place and sometimes we think of the worst and / or the best and adds to the roller coaster of the book how it unfolds neatly according to the accuracy of the author. However, movies can leave one with less imagination and emotion roller coasters that detract from the overall experience. This is what I believe happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
