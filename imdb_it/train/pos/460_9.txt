This is a wonderful new criminal series, which brings together three old supporters of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired investigators led to clarify old cases, under the leadership of Amanda Redman, young and career-focused. The three old policemen, eccentric and irritable, form a brilliant team, applying twenty-year-old detection methods in a police force that has come a long way, sometimes with the effect, sometimes with the horror of their senior officers. The three are portrayed with sympathy, warts and everything. There are wonderful comic scenes, and some very moving as each of the three has to deal with aging and the legacy of their past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (another series is promised next year), each of the characters has developed. The widower James Bolam cannot come to terms with his wife's premature death. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his role as a grandfather. And even the obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and continues to take the medicines! While Amanda Redman faces the now too familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The narrative lines were interesting, although they depended heavily on the wonders of DNA testing. But it's the interaction of four of the best British actors that made the series unmissable.
