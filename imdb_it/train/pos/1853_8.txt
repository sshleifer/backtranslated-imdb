Well, once again it is a film that plays with your feelings and you all come out soft compared to a rocky film. But I'm a sucker for those so I gave a good score ... the acting was very good and there were many feelings. Violence is reduced to a minimum that brings about change. I would have given a 9 if it wasn't for the greeting at the end! All in all, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
