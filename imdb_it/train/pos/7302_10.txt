At the time of writing this book, "Halloween" by John Carpenter is nearing its thirtieth anniversary. Since then it has generated 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they make those "Top 10 ScARIest Movies" lists it's always there. This is quite surprising for a film made with a budget of around $ 300,000 and characterized by an almost unknown cast of emerging young talents. I could go on, but the big question here is: how does the film hold up today? And all I can say is great! <br /> <br /> Pros: A sequence of simple, but spooky opening titles that really creates the atmosphere. An unforgettable soundtrack by the director / coauthor John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Carpenter's stellar direction that keeps the suspense high, gets great shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain. Good performances from the cast then mostly unknown. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary and evil guy. A lot of mysterious moments that will stay with you. The rhythm is slow, but constant and never drags on. Unlike most other slasher films, this is more focused on suspense and terror than on blood and a large number of bodies. <br /> <br /> Cons: Probably not as scary now as it was then. Many of the goofs really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's really how I feel. Despite this, it is truly an important film that continues to reach new generations of cinema fans. And just because it has been redone for a new generation does not mean it will be forgotten. No way, no like. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
