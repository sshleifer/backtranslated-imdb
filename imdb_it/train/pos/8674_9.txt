This is a very typical Tom and Jerry short film, it creates a situation, creates a conflict and creates chaos. The characters behave appropriately, the natural tensions between various characters lead to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in place and respected - all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning: it is absolutely unwise to allow Tom to help you carry out your morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended.
