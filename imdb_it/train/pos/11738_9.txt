ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> with: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> < br /> plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her television program and heads for the small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes, to collect the legacy of the dead aunt, hoping to make a lot of money to open a show in Las Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, give a life to teenagers, win the heart of a stallion (Daniel Greene), avoid being burned on the pole and keep the cookbook from the creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), who has going to use the book to finish the world. <br /> <br /> my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful woman, beautiful and funny and, like Elvira, she is also more morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention the fact that she has a pair of magnificent knockers. In this film, its attractions are put to good use. <br /> <br /> I liked the whole film 'fish out of the water'. You have Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair and her huge "twins", and she's in a Christian city where most girls aren't even allowed to wear make-up. This also makes his love affair with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is just as good as Elvira's uncle / enemy, Vincent, who wants to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence but still does not hinder and steal scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything, from the tits on the tits to the horror spoiler, is here and makes me laugh a lot more than a sequel to SCARY MOVIE. I've heard that there are about 56 lines on the boob in this movie, and any fan of the Roger Corman B-horror movies will love spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will love this movie.
