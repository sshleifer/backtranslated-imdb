Ok, the recent Star Trek story was not good. The Next Generation has vanished in recent seasons, DS9 has remained bravely where no one had ever been before, and Voyager started very badly and never really honored its promise. So when they announced a new Star Trek series, I didn't have high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But overall, it was a solid Trek material and good fun. <br /> <br /> First I will remove the nits. The opening theme is boring and I can't wait to hear it regularly, but that's what the remote controls are for. The really bad thing was the completely free rubbing lotion scene that pushed my wife out of the room. They have to cut out that nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and moved well. The characters, although still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. Vulcans are presented in a very different way than before, with a slightly disturbing theme. I particularly liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character to be unable to show pride in the face of death, but rather to deal with his phobias and fears. They seemed to be faithful to the tradition of Trek, something that was a significant problem in the past series, although they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the ever-present plethora of time travel stories. Does anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up? <br /> <br /> All in all, the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with new eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how things went as they were in the next series. How did the Klingons go from simple insult to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How the Federation was born and only those who put the Earth in command. Why is the main directive so important? If they address these things rather than spilling time travel episodes, this will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: Zephram Cochran who says "where no man has gone before" (not "anyone")
