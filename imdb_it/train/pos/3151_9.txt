I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was damn funny! When I first saw him playing on ETV (Estonian Television) I started to like it. Too bad that the show is in bad weather for me. Hyde is like a good guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes up with stupid ideas. He took these glasses that are brown. I like it . And there is Fez. The perverted group. We all know what he does when he's alone ... He wants to get hurt. He also had it with his boss in an episode. It is from India. And there's Michael, the stupidest guy in the whole group, probably the stupidest in town and his cop! It is so stupid that I remember the following: Hyde says: did you call cops? - No Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to disable the siren? He is a city playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's ex-girlfriend and then Hyde's girlfriend. Then it's Eric Who, the son of a surly war veteran and son of Kitty, the housewife. Her only pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan their marriage. Donna is a sexy girl. Hmm what did I forget? Ah Hyde lives in a basement.
