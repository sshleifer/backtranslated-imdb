Having seen Charley Boorman on Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would look on his show. I thought that Charley had stumbled upon an adorable boy who is very grounded and down to earth. It's nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and their physical form, but they also show their human being! I don't know much about motorcycles, but this show has taken me into consideration from the start. The preparation and organization of this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he is. I love the rhythm of the show and the fast and cheerful music. I can't believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope it's not the end, I can't wait to see the next episode ...
