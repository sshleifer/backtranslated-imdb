I just managed to get hold of The Five Venoms DVD, celestial region 3 and what excellent work they did with it. A fantastic transfer digitally remastered and a must for every Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly simple and has already been mentioned, so I will never go back. Needless to say, these are the fight scenes for which many buy the film, and do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit few and far between and seem to be tried. Bruce Lee could take them and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the kicks and punches come with all the important clicks of "type writer" and air "whooshes", which is a nice effect even if quite funny! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a B +. Good but not exceptional. In a sense I think it could have been a little better. Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had a better story and action.
