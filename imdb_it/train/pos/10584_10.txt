"Footlight Parade" is fascinating on so many levels. There is no way that supposedly staged "theatrical prologues" may have been produced in any theater on earth, of course. Think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for "By A Waterfall", for example. (Berkeley directed John Garfield on "They Made Me a Criminal" six years later and had Dead End Kids singing "By a Waterfall" while showering.) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil "is the best production number in the picture. It is a catalog of the sensibilities of the 1930s Warner Bros. Note that African boys have mixed up with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see blacks embedded in a social scene in other films of the period unless they were carriers on a train or waiter in a big house. Here the blacks are sitting at the bar and singing with each other. I also get a thrill when military dancers give a "card" presentation of the image of Roosevelt. There is also the eagle NRA - the logo of the controversial national administration for the recovery of the New Deal. FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that he would have pulled the nation out of the Depression. You would never see something so job-oriented that leaves MGM, of course. Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the elevation set by the F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than her who plays the Chinese prostitute, "Lil". He barely looks at his feet as he dances, which was one of his distinctive flaws. <br /> <br /> Pre-Code stuff is fun. The "By a Waterfall" number is wonderful in this regard. The girls change into their swimsuits on the busy bus that hurtles over Times Square with all the lights on. The Aquila girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of bifurcation shots that would not have been seen for 35 years. In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such bad pleasures.
