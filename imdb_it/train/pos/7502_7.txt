Although I didn't really feel anything about the character of Lance, and I felt that his wife could do much better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger film if they had spent more time developing the character, perhaps with Lance - I would have liked more. <br /> <br /> However, I totally agree with DoyleLuver, when they said "And to quote the character of Glenn Quinn, Ben:" I'm the star here, it's true, I'm the talented! "" If you watch the movie, look at it, even when it's in the background ... only its facial expressions, all in the eyes, you KNOW for sure what motivates Ben, exactly as you hear in the comments, even if it's a quick look behind your back of a character. Great acting in an honest movie.
