What at first seemed just another introverted French film that offered a blasphemous feeling became for me, secondly, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation. <br /> <br /> Follows Spoiler of sorts. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; apparently he didn't know what hit him. Poor audience; At first we were caught in what looked like a really beautiful and romantic story, only to be carried forward and backward into the dark reality of the mismatch. These two boys were not part of their first ambiguous meeting. Although Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional connection made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find satisfaction in sharing life with someone whose sensitivity was more in tune with the carnival and beach parties. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the action of the camera in this film. The subtitles were absolutely useless, even if my French is "presque rien". I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a lucid, very professional film. Although many scenes seem superfluous, I classify nine out of ten.
