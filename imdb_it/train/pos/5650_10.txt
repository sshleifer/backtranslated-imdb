"Someones at the Door". OHHH, How I miss this show so much ... but we are lucky to have "Invasion". Thanks, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, he had everything. If I had to choose one thing that I liked most about the show, it must be his "unpredictable plot". The favorite actor was Lucas Black. I love that southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible, and my children are fans too. There are some hot and smoking scenes. Even the diabolical ones. So if the kiddos are watching you may want to change (fastforward / skip). He has humor, on a Joss Wheedon level, who misses so many shows. Adult spirit and adult situation, which are managed with finese. The DVD has some extras, but I wish it had many more. If you want to be thrilled and enjoy a great show, come and watch "American Gothic"!
