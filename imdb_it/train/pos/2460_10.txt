Hamlet is by far my favorite of all of Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is an actor devil. His portrait of this was simply fantastic. His soliloquies were breathtaking. Until it was rare that a film could interest me, but I was absorbed by this particular piece. I recommend it to both Shakespeare fans and those not so much. This has everything the modern world looks for in his films: murder, betrayal and deception. Not to beat Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole job. This leaves no stone unturned. When you finish the movie you will feel like you are reading the game by yourself. And as you say "two thumbs up".
