The absolute summary of the work of that clever Dane Douglas Sirk (born Detlef Sierck), Written on the Wind forces our itchy attention into every showy frame. From its appropriately famous opening sequence, with the leaves blowing in the baronial atrium of a Texas villa and the wind blowing through the pages of the calendar in a flashback, the film compresses into its 99 minutes all the familiar intrigue that it would have fed. such a future, small-screen knock-offs like Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest over the years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme that Americans find irresistible in our dollar-based society. The brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled and tormented heirs of the fortune of the Hadly oil; The youth lover Rock Hudson and the new bride Lauren Bacall are the sane strangers trying to keep the lid on the boiling cauldron. (It is said that the story was based on the marriage of Libby Holmann with Reynolds' tobacco money.) As always, the misfits take the whole chewing scenario - and the best jokes to spit out (Malone, in his Oscar-winning performance as drunk) the nymphomaniac with a jones for Hudson, gets to blow up an entire fireworks show of them). Hudson, despite being good, cannot compete with all these exaggerated emotions; Bacall starts strong but grows recessive, a simple convenience of the plot. It does not matter; with a succession of scenes set in extravagant colors, Sirk gives a lesson in how to transform the twisted melodrama in the lush consumer paradise of the late 1950s in America. No one has ever done better.
