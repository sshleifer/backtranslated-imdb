I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including the little Arthur) is surprising and electrifying. <br /> <br /> He could have used a little more screen time for the tasty Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham has been extraordinarily "present" since the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The one who most excited me with surprise, amazement and amazement was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I love it in Forsyte Saga, and in everyone else I've seen it. But he exceeds himself here like Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not have imagined him playing a psychopath demented like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does it. And I love it. And I love it.
