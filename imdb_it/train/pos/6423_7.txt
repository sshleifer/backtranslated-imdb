This film is an incredible non-stop laugh that incorporates all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan play - bumbling heroes, funny supporting characters, dolls rigged for heroines, bad villains, jokes, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small dose of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are both in the dual role of policemen and scammers. The heroine of Amitabh, the policeman, is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is beside Govinda, the policeman. Heroines are simple rouge-suffocated props as usual. Scammers have no heroines. Paresh Rawal plays his evil deed forward DAUD (He played a similar Don also in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a short role. He takes his famous act "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is flawless as usual - like a witty and cheerful cop Pyaare Mohan and like a conman Chhote Miyaan. Imitate the Bihari style of Hindi by speaking with hilarious results. Believe it or not, Amitabh Bachchan pales in comparison to him. But still AB is fine. Madhuri Dixit makes a cameo as himself in the song "Makhna". She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is fantastic. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Don't go looking for any LOGIC as it's a comedy and the script is completely comfortable. Enjoy yourself.
