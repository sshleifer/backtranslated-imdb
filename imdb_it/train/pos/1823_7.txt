I remember seeing this movie with my friends when we were 4, but the strange thing is that I never looked at it later. The other day I was babysitting and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven so we rented both films and watched them together today and he really loved these movies. So many memories came back to watch this movie again and I have to admit that I even cried a little. I'm 22 and the ending still comes to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most touching animated films and I am honestly shocked by this rating of 5.8, I thought this film would bring back good memories for the others too. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is so fascinating and fun. Charlie is a game dog that is killed by another game dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a watch that can't stop ticking or that's the end of his life. When he and his best friend, Itchy, search for Carface and spy on him, they find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a small orphan who talks to animals and finds out who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he ends up learning that perhaps he should put Ann-Marie before him when Carface returns to him with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect movie for the family, it's not Disney, but this is an excellent family movie to watch. Not to mention the fact that it's so cute and touching. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this film for me when I was a child made me believe that dogs have a soul. How could they not? They are so loving and I think I'll cry again. But anyway, I'd recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
