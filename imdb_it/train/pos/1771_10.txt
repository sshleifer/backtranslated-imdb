A classic series that should at least be repeated or published on DVD. Billy Toth, after realizing that it was adopted after the death of his parents, embarks on a journey to find his real parents. After various rites of passage, his research culminates in the discovery that his father's identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian ski slopes (?) And on the pursuit of a cliff with the consequent death of Billy's father's traitor. shot in various destinations around Europe and appeared lucid and incredibly well done with some episodes that cross the realm of film noir and thriller. The main arch was often eclipsed by the bands of life that Billy went through during his fatigued years to find the secrets of his mother and father. A class act but undervalued and forgotten.
