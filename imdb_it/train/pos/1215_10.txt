This is my favorite of the three bear care films. Once again I liked all the songs. The big problem however, as many people have pointed out, is that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the first film, the bears met their "cousins" who apparently never knew. Obviously it wasn't until the end that the cousins ​​received their belly symbols after trying how much they cared. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow up with caring bears and have tummy symbols all the time. That being said, this is not a bad movie until it is kept separate from the first. I thought that the character of Darkheart was much more evil than Nicholas of the first. But at the same time I felt that it added a kind of balance to the sweetness of the care bears. I also liked the part that interests us in the end, even though I know that other people have had mixed feelings about that scene. And of course, I really enjoyed the songs. My favorites are Crescenti and Forever Young. Nursing films have always had such beautiful songs. Ten stars for a great film.
