This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his fascinating self as the casual Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a delightfully crazy museum curator, the usual comic relief is pretty funny here, and there are many suspicions to throw an eye at. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not have the same talent as Thomas Beck, the usual second protagonist in these programmers, but it is adequate. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and as he talks stereotypically his jokes are funny, not humiliating because of his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his short time on screen.
