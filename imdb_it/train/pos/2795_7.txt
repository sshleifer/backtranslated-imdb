I love playing soccer and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, as was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was good at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing soccer, but her parents want her to learn to cook and want her to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a secret soccer team, he meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who is his coach. When her parents find strikes, but her father allows her to play the big game of the marriage of her Pinky sisters (Archie Punjabi). Eventually his parents realize how much he loves football and let her go abroad to play.
