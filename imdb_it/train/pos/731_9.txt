This movie is SOOOO fun !!! The acting is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sexy, the lines are subtle, and the plot is just what every high school student dreams of doing at his school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the cynicism with care. If you like monty python, you will love this movie. This film is a bit "fat" esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are nice; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is finished. This musical is in second place in musicals (second next to the blues brothers). But please, don't think of it as a musical to say; since the songs are so pleasant, it's hard to say that a carefully choreographed scene is happening. I think of this film as a comedy with romantic nuances. You will be reminded of how it was to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will remember your old school days after watching this movie. Highly recommended for both the family (since it is very young, but also for adults since there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
