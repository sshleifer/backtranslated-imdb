Shintarô Katsu, best known for Zatôichi's films, again the protagonist of this third and last film in the Kenji Misumi (mostly known as Lone Wolf and Cub), the Hanzo saga 'The Razor' Itami is played by the great ninja in struggle, rapeing 'ghosts', and discovering dark events in the Shogunate treasure. Hanzo's "plot" was a bit stale and repetitive. What was a novel in the first film, it was no longer. Fortunately, this was better of the second thanks to having more humor I'm just glad they chose to stop at the trilogy (I'm looking at YOU Lucas) <br /> My Grade: B <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Merely Trailers for all 3 Hanzo the Razor films <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima unleashes both tits, Mako Midori to her left
