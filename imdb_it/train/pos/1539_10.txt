I saw it at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It is hard to believe that this is Mrs Blom's directorial debut, it is beautifully traveled and performed. A large cast of characters may have come out of an Anne Tyler novel, meaning they are lined with background stories and potential futures, there are no false notes, surprising explosions of humor between self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not terrifying dilemmas. If you've seen "The Best of Youth", you'll recognize how well the characters are drawn through little moments, even if the story moves quickly. I really hope it's distributed in the United States. I live in a fairly sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish movies of any kind.
