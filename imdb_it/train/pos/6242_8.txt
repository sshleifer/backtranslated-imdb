I agree with the previous comment in naming the content of the film "daily madness", but I would like to specify that: "Dog Days" talks about how women are treated in a (male) society. The episodes we see here show some variations in the daily discrimination of women, mostly classified according to age group. There is an old man who makes his new companion appear and acts as his late wife did, treating her like a doll who will act "worthy of wearing" the dress of the former. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he a (violent) teacher. Also we find a slightly younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and instead of being really jealous about his business, he even makes friends with his competitors. A young adult man makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really worried about being pretty enough for him - that he must be the jewel by his side and follow his rules of etiquette. In the end there is a man in his fifties who calculates his own advantage offers a furious client a simple hitchhiker woman who - taking her guilty for having scratched her car - beats her naturally. To complete the examples we find the man's companion in the "master-slave couple" - after having abused it collectively - threatening and humiliating the first "in his good" because he will get rid of his companion and take himself as his new "teacher". During all this, the inhabitants of the newly built neighborhood in which the action takes place leans under the scorching summer sun - absolutely still (sic!). Unfortunately I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic story of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen has convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool to teach even the least sensitive spectators what goes wrong, thanks to good visualization.
