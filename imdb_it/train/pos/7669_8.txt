Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but it is absolutely useful. It really reminds me of old magazines from the 30s and 40s. This is why I would have liked to see follow-up movies ... but judging from the rest of the Full Moon production there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there are too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without it "this could have been a magical Harry Potter-style party that the children would have eaten. Both Jeffrey Combs that Yvette Nipar are fantastic - I wasn't sure that if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered over an A-list photo on this film, it was very believable. No seriously! Anyway - it's a pity they didn't have the money for grant the license to Dr. Strange, because I think this could be a total kiddie phenomenon.
