Love Crimes by Lizzie Borden is an important film, which deals with the dark side of female sexuality (and includes full frontal female nudity, which certainly beats the male gender). Flirt with sadomasochism and the prisoner who falls in love with the kidnapper's theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of female libido is sometimes superficial and spasmodic, but Borden has traveled far beyond the feminist dogma of women who gain power through their insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> A striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, is seducing an elderly woman wearing trousers asking her to show how a horse rides. He puts a crop in his saddle between his legs, pressing it against his horse, and this greatly increases his excitement. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly he leaves his home and she barely swears at the closed door. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bergin plays the scam artist, and although he falls a long way from the beautiful, he chooses the Janes plain and has a cinematographic presence sufficient to make believe that women could swallow his line. According to all reports, Sean Young proves a strange person, and she is not at all beautiful. Yet in this film, as district attorney, his intense face and slender and slender body, accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement turn into an erotic charm. His performance is strong and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an interesting vision of the world, and the fact that it is so in contrast with the modern and contemptuous zeitgeist that I really appreciate.
