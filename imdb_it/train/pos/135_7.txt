It was an excellent piece for the puppet series because this film showed all the series, from one to seven. And this concerned a woman trying to stop the new puppeteer because I never imagined that the puppets would suffer. He also showed some of the puppet series that I didn't see and I what to see as bad as the second part. He showed an appearance of Torch that can transform things and humans, which is nice, and showed the return of the puppeteer from the first part. He also showed small aliens from the fourth part who was also handsome, showed the other episodes that they could be good for them and he did. So thanks to this Puppet Master is going to be a great success.
