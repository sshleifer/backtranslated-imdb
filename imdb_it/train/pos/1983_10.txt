I saw it recently on a cable channel. The film is fantastic; It is one of the few musicals that I have seen that does not avoid light and darkness. It represents part of the splendor of the era along with much of the squalor. Some of the set's dance sequences are so many going on, I didn't know where to look next. One day I'll go see it on the big screen, just to see what's going on. But what really takes this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a very petty and threatening man, but there is something else, some inner demons. It gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. It was almost as if Sykes's character was on the edge of madness, waiting for the trigger. I saw Bill Sykes by Robert Newton of the 1948 movie and thought he was "just" a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my living room.
