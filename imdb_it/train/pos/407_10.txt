Oh my God ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you on a fantastic run and doesn't let you go until the last shot in the face. This is the movie for Stormriders fans and so on. Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I didn't like some things, they used a lot of stand-ins. I wanted to see the real person arguing but, oh well ... some little disappointment, and I didn't like it very much until I looked at it again, when you understand it more it totally kicks A **! I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a real Asian movie to watch this movie. I give this film one of my highest grades. Go see it when it comes out in America !!!
