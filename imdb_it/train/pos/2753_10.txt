My favorite movie of all time! I've seen a lot of movies, but this beats them all! Excellent acting, wonderful story. As a "normal" person, you will begin to love George. Even if he is an actor, he is also himself and a very lovable person. And mum what is most important: you'll learn to respect and look differently to people with Down syndrome.
