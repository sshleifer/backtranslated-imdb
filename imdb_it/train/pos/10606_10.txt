I just finished watching this movie and found it very funny. It is a small and peaceful film that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" interpretations. It simply takes you into the lives of people living in a small village in the woods of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas plays Raymond Toker well, a solitary young man who finds an abandoned child in the woods. Toker's search for the child's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimy viscount with a second purpose. And David plays the villain perfectly. <br /> <br /> There's a lot more to this than the first thing you see. Shot on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it's worth watching.
