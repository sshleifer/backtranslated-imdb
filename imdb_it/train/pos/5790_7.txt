Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), then I'm giving up right now. In her short skirt, high boots and a pronounced bust line, she is a real girl, even though her zombie eyeshadow is like it goes and comes. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the sexiest in the series. Notice the realistic and revealing fight game with Bronson until he weighs it down on his chin, ruining all the fun. Okay, I should probably leave my hormonal response out. <br /> <br /> This is a half hour produced very well by that undervalued force behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Naturally, the producers want to anticipate the third season with an above-average entry. It is post-nuclear holocaust America (we know why it is part of the invasion force) and only the American Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery remain, along with about twenty tons of real wrecks. They wander between destruction in alternating moods, as we wonder how long it will take for biology to win politics, which of course it will eventually do (lucky Bronson). And this is all. No real speech, except what Bronson has to say which is rather exaggerated. Nevertheless, the script is still fun, and rather bold for its time, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a famous Cold War stereotype of the time). <br /> <br /> In passing ... it is rather curious that the Slavic aspect of Bronson (Buchinsky) would have been chosen as an American and the Montgomery with a shiny aspect like the Slavic. As for the appearance, it should be the other way around. My hypothesis is that the producers did not want to throw the American into the physically weaker role of the female, regardless of appearances. However, there is some of the usual TZ fright or atmosphere, however the episode remains a very, very watchable 30 minutes.
