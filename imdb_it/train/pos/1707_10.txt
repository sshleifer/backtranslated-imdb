This film is not for everyone. You are bright enough to get "this" or you are not. Fans of science fiction films that don't take themselves too seriously will surely love this movie. I recommend this film for those who can enjoy parodies and parodies. Everyone I recommended this movie enjoyed. If you like movies by Monty Python or Mel Brooks, you'll probably like this. The characterizations of the voice are done in an ironic way and the headers travel fast and furious.
