For those of you who don't refer, clubberin had 4 punches that hit a body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the magazine. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage. I remember seeing Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his work days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I would be listing here all. Point is WCW had an impressive roster in the pre Hogan days and they were producing fun television. Dusty Rhodes comments in his last years he gave me a new reason to watch when I started smoking the pot as a teenager ... I really wish Vince would put him on the microphone for a show or two, maybe the next Great American Bash? Their CLUBBERIN! Here's DA PLUNDA! It was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
