I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and while I'm studying film in Canada of all places, I will definitely take it to class. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around the probably most unfortunate film team in the story itself, is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single word game in time. <br /> <br /> If you simply couldn't laugh during "Hollywood North" "I suggest you see a psychiatrist right away - you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to the wonderful script I also noticed the great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where do they really act? Jennifer Tilly (playing a hilariously bad actress) and Martin Landau, also produced a very sharp and fun performance. <br /> <br /> Great movie, cast again best.
