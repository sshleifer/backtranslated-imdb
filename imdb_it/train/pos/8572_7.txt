The first film was beautiful, but it's not as good as the wonderful animated classic that I found most moving and captivating. This sequel is inferior, but it's not bad at all. Of course, the slapstick is too much, the script has its weaknesses and the plot is a bit trivial. But dogs are very nice here, and Eric Idle is as hilarious as the ara. The film is beautiful to look at with fashionable photography and stunning costumes (especially those from Cruella), and the music is pleasant. The acting is for the most part very good, Ioan Gruffudd is captivating and Gerard Depardieu while giving better performances is having fun as an accomplice in Crudelia. But the best thing, as in the first film, is the incredible Glenn Close in a deliciously exaggerated performance like Cruella, even more wicked than before. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
