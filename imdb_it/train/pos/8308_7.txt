On a musical Sunday it is right to fill your heart, and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawers from the ladies and define rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Looking to Leon to provide a definitive characterization, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> This was a fascinating biopic when we saw Little Richard fight with his father, his church and himself for what he was. He won the battle and there is no one else who has his voice or his style.
