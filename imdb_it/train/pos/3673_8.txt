In 2004 I saw "True", the contribution of Tom Tykwer to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and became electrified. It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much. Obviously I wanted to see the whole movie, and I would even check who was connected, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the internet. <br /> <br /> First of all, what I have to say is wonderful. The photograph is BEAUTIFUL in every short and filmed, in the worst case it's nothing special - but still bright and clear. Later I read the curiosity here, and maybe it's like the 6K scan gives more justice to all the DP work. My special favorites are the first scene of "Quais de Seine" (that light of the sun!), The Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement" - but you know, what the hell I like all of them: "Vero" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still makes me nervous with those bright colors (my eyes tremble!) and "Quartier Latin" is the gold imprisoned on silver. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some beautiful short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to the content. I very (and I mean VERY) like the eclecticism that is so felt. You never had the same themes or treatments between two short films, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to allow all these artists to explore beautiful and in-depth things in short films. I loved moving from a simple love story to a crazy Chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder in a social commentary in a terrorist comedy in a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's great that they took the opportunity to leave all these directors to stage things that are not used in mainstream cinema (which I came to despise heavily). It's not very experimental, but I can breathe the breathing space of these people. <br /> <br /> I like the little time and I love acting. I love simplicity and I love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism and in general it is a film that is very, very nice to see, alone or with someone. To feel simply. It made me feel very good. <br /> <br /> There is something serious about it ... it's so frank ... <br /> <br /> What didn't I like? Well, for me there are two short films that are not exactly the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good-natured, of course, and maybe even necessary, but seems too commercial?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" which even though I love acting, I heard the themes were forced. But of course, it's just me. "Tour Eiffel" I too did not love, but I think it is probably due to my sensitivity very different from that of Sylvain Chomet? I don't know if this film has a particular interest for people who already know the actor and the directors, and so they can have fun in their interaction, in surprises (look for Alexander Payne in a fun role) and basically in "what this director will do this? "excellent question. I really liked it that way. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: most of the short films I loved and all together form a beautiful and energetic mix. I highly recommend it. Definitely !!! So, see if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
