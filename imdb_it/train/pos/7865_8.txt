Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once in the film did I find myself staring into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think someone with more glamor or enthusiasm would have been better, but he did a great job. All the secondary actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this film THE STORY is fantastic, and very realistic, it doesn't beat the balls, it's very simple to send your message. I think more films like this should be made, I'm sick of watching the same cotton candy films over and over again, they're getting hard to digest now. Everyone should watch, it's a great movie. -Only my 2 cents :)
