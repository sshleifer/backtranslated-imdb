Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone consultant for a Manhattan hotline. One day, unfortunately, his condominium runs out. Parker and his cat make him alive but now they are stuck in the daunting task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. The word comes to Parker that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but will only accept a gay male. Since Parker is straight but the price is right, he decides to pretend to be gay. Samantha likes it immediately and welcomes him as his new partner. But, poor Parker. Sam is adorable, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? Also, doesn't Sam have a successful business man anyway? This is a sweet, funny and fun movie with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is a series of "how can I continue this scene", with Sam asking Parker for a shampoo while she's taking a shower or begging him to keep her in bed when he gets bad news. Also, it is necessary for Parker to produce his own "false" gay partner, Boris, when Sam insists on fixing him with a man he knows. I hope the gay community does not consider it too offensive, since this viewer felt that most problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small-scale film, even the costumes, set designs and camera work were very beautiful. So, if you love those funny love stories, take it soon. You'll like what you see, I know.
