this is an honest attempt to make a haunting and sweet love story. the obvious inspiration behind the hit television series "Bewitched", this adorable sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. the comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays an unfortunate but stolid "straight". Kim Novac plays a voluptuous blonde witch who captures him through the use of a love spell. but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch, she is satisfied with the duties of managing her shop and is consoled by the fact that her beloved piercial (her familiar feline) is looked after by her beloved aunt. you will recognize the aunt from "Murder of death". this film is fun and moving, with a spectacular spirit and a witch-like feeling. worth a look
