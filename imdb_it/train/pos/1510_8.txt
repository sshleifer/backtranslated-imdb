Yes, this is a horror film and it was a lot of fun! This is because although the film was clearly horror, some of the stories had a light spirit - and there were even occasionally some laughter. This is not bad at all, because sometimes horror movies are a bit stifling and too serious. For this reason and because all four stories were pretty good, it's one of the best films of this style I've seen. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that links each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people who rent the house or investigate what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> The first segment featured Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has the writer's block. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately, Elliott's block vanishes and he is constantly working on a story about a serial killer. Surprisingly, immediately after his block vanishes, he actually begins to see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears, making it appear that he is losing his mind. This could only be the best of stories, as the beautiful ending makes the story alive. <br /> <br /> The second, although not at all bad, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl who died some time ago (although her image seemed incredibly contemporary). When he enters a chamber of the horrors wax museum in the city, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and is fascinated and frightened by it. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and he also sees the figure and is ecstatic. All this leads to a final that, frankly, was a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee is therefore an incredibly tough and stern father of a pathetic girl. During most of this segment, Lee looked like an idiot, but in the end it is possible to understand his behavior. Although slow, this ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the most foolish and was destined to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" of the television series DR. WHO) is a highly tempered actor known for his portraits of Dracula. However, there is nothing right in the film according to him and in a pity attack, he treads the set to find better props for this vampire movie. It is actually quite interesting that he played this role, as it seemed natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires for billions (give or take some). I liked Pertwee's line when he said that Lee and the other recent incarnations of Dracula were all disgusting compared to those of Bela Lugosi! Maybe that's why Lee didn't take this part! Despite some very stupid moments, it was very funny and fun - perhaps as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film started and finished so well, he acted and wrote in an excellent way, it's hard I don't like this movie.
