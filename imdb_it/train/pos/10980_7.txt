I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. He has two fascinating characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary. To get the real Beales story, I had to browse all the bonus materials and comments on the DVD and search the web. <br /> <br /> Even if the Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) notice the suggestion that this film is an exploiter, this is exploitation in the true sense of the word. Every little effort is made to explain the Beales or how they arrived at the condition they were in - Maysles' approach seems to be just turning on the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even in the Criterion version, is poor and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate that this film was made a little early in the history of the documentary film, it is ironic to compare it to the Geraldo Rivera series (!) Far superior to the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island since 1972, four years before Gray Gardens was filmed. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a New Yorker review, there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and a documentary was not one of them. <br /> <As for Edith and Edie, the thing I kept thinking about while watching the movie was "where the hell is their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and insecure conditions. How is it possible that Jackie O, married to one of the richest men on earth (or the wealthy Bouvier family) could not afford to make Edith and Edie a decent home? Or at least hire a part-time housekeeper or a carer to get in and keep an eye on both? It is shameful and a lasting dishonor for the entire Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may seem negative, I would strongly recommend the Gray Gardens to anyone who loves documentaries. Perhaps one day someone will come and make a documentary on this documentary - bringing back the rich past (and after) of the Beales and the entire subsection of the Hamptons society in the 1970s.
