An actor in distress finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start throwing down the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look of the LA actor (in difficulty). It takes us into that world with ironic ease and wit. He also has a polished appearance and a very skillful direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that do not compromise its production values ​​at any level. The writing is narrow, the dialogue is of the highest quality. Cassini is an actor, and the role really shows his talent. The culminating scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and could become one of the most enjoyable Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it at an advanced projection, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and talked about it enthusiastically.
