My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (senior representative, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg for the Japanese, and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to know that my father was the technical consultant for this film and I hope he had an impact on the film in making it look like it was then, as I read in various comments written by the viewers of this film it seemed like a real life . My father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and has always wanted things to be seen for what they were, so I would like to believe that it had something to do with that. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, he is Japanese), and a few years ago he received one of the highest praise of the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and activities to bring Kendo and Iaido back to Japan since McArthur banned them after WWII. <br /> <br /> My father was a marine once, but I know that once you're a marine, you're always a marine. And that's exactly what it is and I love it and respect it a lot. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this movie if someone had a copy. And I'd like to give it to my dad for his 94th birthday this year!
