This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic acting and gag of sight, a tribute to the early films of Buster Keaton. A lot of slapstick: Buster falling on a bulkhead, falling into a puddle, running without pants. Stupid science invented by a helmet of time, reminiscent of an idea by Flash Gordon of what the future would be. Low prices, like $ 1.95 for women's hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef, seem outrageously high for Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when mistakenly transported into the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to get back! The "scientist" of that time wants to return to a calmer world, the 1890s he studied and admired. They come back together, and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. It's enough. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing - long underused Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairer who adjusts the Time Helmet - which foreshadows his career in the washing machine.
