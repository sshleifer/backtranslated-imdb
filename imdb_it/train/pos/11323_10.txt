Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by an h-game. Somehow the producers turned around making this series successful without any of the h-stuff. It couldn't have been otherwise because the development of the characters is fantastic just as it is depicted in this series and any alteration could ruin perfection (you'll understand once you see all the episodes). /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer took the time to present the characters) things gain momentum quickly and immediately after the middle series the action becomes so intense that you paste it in your place. <br /> <br /> The topic of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War that took place in the city of Fukuky over the past 50 years. The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from then on. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large part of the city. Reluctantly he witnessed a dispute between two Servitors triggering his Reiju (sacred mark) to summon one of the most powerful servants on the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned "A beauty so immeasurable ... I was lost for words". <br /> <br /> You don't have to compare this series to another to fully understand the plot. FSN offers much more than a few sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, an excellent soundtrack, and excellent character and relationship development. Presents the changes that occur within the characters' personalities as the events precipitate. The action reveals credible dynamic emotional and behavioral models of individuals (not similar to the linear type used by other series) that constantly shape their personalities to reveal, from under the mask of perfection, imperfect characters. <br /> <br /> The character of Saber is linked to a medieval legend that has been modified to fit this series and should be accepted as such. You shouldn't watch FSN think that you don't present the viewer with the historical fact, remember that this is a series of adventures / fantasy and not a documentary and enjoy for as long as possible. The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have observed them in the same breath.
