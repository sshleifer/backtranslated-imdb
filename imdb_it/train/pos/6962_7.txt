My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I really expected a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? Was! But this movie has had so many wonderful laughs and a funny plot that anyone could make fun of. I know this was a very poor movie, but Uma and Anna were really fantastic and Steve was an exceptional addition together with an exceptional cast that seemed to have been so funny and this made the movie really working. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (terrifying, it's the actual name of my best friend) is not the typical woman looking for an average librarian, when Matt, your average male, asks her to go out, it's more than how much he expected, he asked G-Girl for a date, the superhero of the world! But when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl really is and decides it might be a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenny hasn't had it since when he's in love with another girl, Hannah, and she will make her life is a living hell, I mean, let's face it, she couldn't have chosen a better girl to break with. <br /> <br /> The effect was trivial, but you move seriously beyond, quickly, the story and the cast made the story really working and I loved Uma in this film, it was a step ahead of Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a funny movie that you shouldn't take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that I think if I could make it a laugh, anyone could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
