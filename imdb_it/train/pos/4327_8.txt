I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's so hard to present the whole book as it should be, and others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very nice show with the staging of Nicholas Nickelby. I adore Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think it's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could make a better Jarndyce, but I agree with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be easier - this is a long one, and if you are not interested all legal situations can be boring or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough not to be boring. I just LOVED Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should be able to judge for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I must say I loved the show. Maybe if I read the book again, as I usually do, after seeing the movie, maybe I can be more critical. Meanwhile, I think it's a good presentation.
