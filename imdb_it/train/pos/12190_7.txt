It is very difficult to say what was happening with "The Lady from Shanghai" and what the film could have been without interference in the studio. Orson Welles's main interest in cinema at this point was to raise money for his theater; in fact, funding his projects is what prompted him to look for acting jobs. He did "Lady of Shanghai" for his future ex-wife, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn was scared of Rita's image and held back the film for a year. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with Else (Hayworth, beautiful with short blond hair). Her husband is a notorious criminal lawyer Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) who is so paralyzed while he is out. He entrusts O'Hara to work on his yacht, and there O'Hara finds himself deeper and deeper in a network of murders and deceptions. <br /> <br /> "The lady of Shanghai" moves at a snail's pace, although I agree with one of the posters that today's films are criticized for taking the time to build a plot. Still, this movie drags on. The scene in the fun house is fantastic - Welles wanted it without music, though, and I think the studio was cut. It's a shame. The photography is amazing, full of atmosphere, bold and very elegant. <br /> <br /> Welles was an excellent actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and gifted with a magnificent voice and technique, but in many films it is almost as if he does not trust himself or take time to develop a character. Instead it relies on external things like accents and false noses. One of the few times he didn't do it was "Tomorrow is Forever", in which the director received an excellent and deeply felt performance. Contrast this with "Compulsion" where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting while he phones in his performance. Here Welles is doing the fourfold duty - as a director, star, co-writer and storyteller. Showing a completely useless accent and looking intense was a quick way to characterize. However, it is always compelling. <br /> <br /> The support players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, splendid and with a soft voice (her way of singing was still renamed by Anita Ellis) is, as usual, a complete goddess and one of the great appearances on the screen. What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty. <br /> <br /> Every film directed by Orson Welles deserves to be seen, and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But this leaves the viewer frustrated, as does "The Magnificent Ambersons" - as it does any work that Welles has done within the study system. He was a great artist who should have had a freer kingdom; he was not. It was a strange dichotomy: he needed more freedom, but as evidenced by some of his latest works, he needed the structure of the studio. Alas, he couldn't have both.
