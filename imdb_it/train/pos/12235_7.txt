"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastically coarse, scruffy and energetic Z-quality production that every self-respecting horror fanatic must simply see for himself! The ideal way to describe this low budget 70s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times more lousy! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission, but he turns out to be the bearer of a horrible disease that makes it radioactive and ... makes him melt! Shocked after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve walks out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and falling from the body parts behind. Dr. Ted Nelson must find it urgently, as the disease has also caused Steve an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may seem utterly stupid, but this film is extremely fun and contains great makeup effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The guy's face stands out like a decomposing pizza and his heavy breathing makes him look like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that the script by William Sachs wastes no time with boring scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repugnance starts immediately and lasts until the last moment of the film. Enjoy this stupid horror gem and try to disable your brain activity as much as possible because if you start contemplating the many nonsense in the script, you will lose all the campy fun!
