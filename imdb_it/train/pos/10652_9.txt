I don't know why the critics ruined this film. I almost never agree with them anyway. <br /> <br /> The film could have been a little more scary - I don't usually go to horror movies! I also had to do some psychotherapy to see it during the day. I don't need to take the trouble! ;) (Also the cinema was full of children, eh !; ...) Liam was exceptional as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> <br /> The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a ghostly way. The special and sound effects were fantastic. I also liked the soundtrack, especially the delicate melodies of Eleanor and her journey to save children, the way she grew from routine and stagnant life and finally get her power, peace and freedom.
