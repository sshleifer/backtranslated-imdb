My Tutor Friend is a well-scripted romantic comedy film that has something like My Sassy Girl .. there are no kissing and sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions. Sex is not always required in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is light in tone with occasional scenes of CG cartoons mixed into the film. I like the part where Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and will soon become a father. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the public. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
