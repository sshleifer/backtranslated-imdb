Before you watch, make sure you've seen Night of the Living Dead ... This could be the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! Absurd, disgusting 'special effects' (the rope, the rope !!!), and eating slices of bread ... what else do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Don't watch this movie while eating bread ... you could be scared!)
