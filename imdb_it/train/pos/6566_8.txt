Have you ever wondered where the ideas for romance novels and other articles come from? According to 'Jake Speed' they are based on real people, they live the adventures of which they write and publish. This film is quality family entertainment, a moderate amount of violence and skimpy clothes at worst. Even the language is not a problem, and the jokes are fun at all levels. This is an Austin Powers look at Indian Jones, without the exaggerated antics of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for children in the 10-15 range.
