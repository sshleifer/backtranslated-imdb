Steve Carell made a career playing the strange little guy, first on 'The Daily Show', and then in various secondary roles. In Virgin, Carell has found an intelligent and amusing screenplay that perfectly capitalizes on its strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet and solitary life. Andy is a bit strange, but in a strange and funny way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy casually reveals that she is a virgin. His collaborators, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially make fun of Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being who is Andy, and they decide to help him by helping him to end his virginity. And so begins Andy's research into adulthood. Andy is the quintessence of the innocent, and most of the humor comes from his naivety for the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Part of the humor is gross stuff, but most of it is just a cleverly done smart comedy. Also, I found some parts of the film that were really touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic and friendship relationships for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the film as a love story or a drama; it's a comedy behind the wheel. However, every good comedy I've ever seen contains enough heart that you care about the characters. A good comparison would be "The Wedding Crashers" this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a little more vulgar in some of his lines. I particularly enjoyed the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the film. Without giving anything, he reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun; lets you laugh and smile, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a play. I highly recommend it.
