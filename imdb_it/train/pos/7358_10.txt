One of the most provocative films of all time with an excellent cinematography supported by Mc Clarens and a stunning quote "do you believe in love for the first site?" <br /> <br /> A trace of expressionism was evident in this image, further catapulting the flawless integrity of the films. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria clearly loved the film and the role she played so much that she couldn't even bother to mention it in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> the best part of the film should undoubtedly be the heroic rescue by MC Clure while saving the handicapped boy with the impediment of the speech. The use of James Cahiil's sound effects is unmatched to date. The drug shot he performed at the beginning of the film is painfully realistic. When I saw this movie for the first time I was so constrained by the intense lack of respect for the Gang Inthused brothers of the Southside gang and the CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far the most encapsulated crack that Cahill was committed to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally this film has sentimental value for me and I will download it in the near future. Here's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
