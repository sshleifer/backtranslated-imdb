This is one of the three films of the 80s that I can think of that were unfortunately overlooked at the time and unfortunately still neglected. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a film that horribly neglects due to Salva's legal / sexual problems. Another would be Cameron's Closet which I think is a bit underestimated - not great, but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House deserves your time and I think it's one of those very silent films that will stay in your brain for much longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after having seen it and I still do some pauses, while something that I could have seen 6 months ago has entered the ether.
