As part of the Casino Royale release, this film was screened with the new Bond, in the cast of Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off to be a little boring, but I'm glad I blocked it. Basically, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who barely sees anyone and hasn't had a boyfriend for years. His daughter says he may want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After only meeting for a few days, May and Darren have a secret relationship. And at his age, with a 30-something, and the new Bond ?! However, obviously they want to keep it a secret, but May has regrets and wonders if Helen finds out. When he does, Darren gets fewer problems than May. In fact, Helen asks permission to hit her. Played by Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
