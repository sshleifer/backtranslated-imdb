Maybe this movie is really bad, but it's very funny. Bad acting and bad direction increase the film's hysterical nature. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go to this movie waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, then you will hate it. If you look at it while you're in a good mood and accept it as a good, stupid fun you'll have fun. Watch the scene where they try to hang the brothers, the funniest scene in the film. I wish the Mystery Science Theater 3000 had done it !!
