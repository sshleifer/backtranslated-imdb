I won't pretend to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because I'm not. I've only seen 5 of his animated films so far: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and The Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can say is that I found "Fire and Ice" the most pleasant of the lot. It is a fantasy tale of swords and sorcery directed along the lines of Conan the Barbarian, but the beautiful work of art, realistic animation and the lively soundtrack lend a very classic charm to this film. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning, it is the animation itself. I don't care what people say about rotoscoping, but I think Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was surprised how realistic the character movements were. The style of directing and the drawings of photorealistic characters made "Fire and Ice" feel more like a great economic success than a cartoon. Unfortunately the level of artistic details tends to be a bit inconsistent, especially towards the end of the film. Some scenes look really flat, with minimal body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, realistic action will naturally follow. Not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. I would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like Zack Snyder's 300. I noticed however that, although there was blood, the blood spatters were reduced to a minimum. Once again, a great choice from the creative team that does nothing but increase the viewing experience by not taking things too "over the top". <br /> <br /> Even if I don't recognize any "big name" in the cast, the actors voice can provide a satisfactory performance; keep the delivery of each line realistically subjugated and amass it only in the case of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad ?? Yes i did it. Because that's exactly what history talks about, a normal story against evil. Nothing really original in the story that seems to be just a mix of pre-existing fantasy movie clich√©s involving warriors and unkindly dressed girls. Anyone looking for "depth" would be very disappointed. The characters are not given much development and some of them like Nekron and Darkwolf are quite three-dimensional (I still heard rumors about some deleted scenes that explain Darkwolf's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother. Scenes like the deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show). In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find that the whole movie was just a sort of "technology demo" to show fantastic animation and art, with the story crumpled and thrown away as an afterthought to make it pass like a real "movie". <br /> <br /> A true classic of a bygone era, "Fire and Ice" truly captures the fiery spirit of adventure and mysticism with its wonderful renderings of fantastic creatures and fascinating characters. It is a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and the artist Frank Frazetta with a good dose of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Would you stay with today's animated film standards? Surely not. But I urge fans of animation in general to "take off their horses" and give this simple but beautiful film the chance to grow on you. It is truly a gem from the 80s that is worth a visit.
