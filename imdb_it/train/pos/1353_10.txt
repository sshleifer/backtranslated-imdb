The cast is different and now they have a different approach, we have the smart street team "Networth" vs. the alleged professional team "Magna" but boy if you think the smart street team would have problems you'd be right. While the Magna team struggled at times, the street team simply disintegrated week after week. <br /> <br /> First of all some things to reiterate until "Apprentice 3" first continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game of this series: if you are a good project manager, but you lose, the team will will turn on and you will be fired, despite the fact that your teammates behind are often the ones who do half-ass jobs. Simply absurd, that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually "weeds" is the best while dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone this season has seen a total of curses, back stabs and even homosexual offensive stereotypes made as teams try to campaign. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner those three are the only ones that I feel have been unfairly dismissed by Trump, the rest really did because they only caused conflict, anger and suffering. It is amazing how a candidate Audrey Evans said she did a good job and how some of her worthless companions are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is the game, it is "The Apprentice" where manipulation, stabs in the back and always popular "everyone joins forces on the rules of mentality of the project manager". <br /> <br /> It was a fun ride, however the candidates received a wide range of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses, the construction of new apartments. <br /> <br /> Despite being still the Apprentice, then all you can do is laugh all the time as insanity and insanity until you become a lucky person is the winner.
