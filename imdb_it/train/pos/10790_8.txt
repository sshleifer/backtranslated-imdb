This incredibly formidable shot of the "Walker, Texas Ranger" team contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a TV movie. Furthermore, one can practically predict the result from the beginning. However, it is a fun little film that does the job: has fun. This is all it was meant to do and it does. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not bad at all. Even acting is decent, which is no surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and of "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will surely love it. If not, don't waste time. 8/10
