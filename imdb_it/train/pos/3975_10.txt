If you lived in the 60s, this film can sometimes be painful and sometimes quite joyful. It's all there, but the small tabloid print of the counterculture prevailing at the moment. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still manifesting: "don't talk too soon because the wheel is still rotating, for the times in which they change". While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its diffusion at the time, this alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists and helping the hyper-development of computer activities. Greetings to the directors of one who was there - you've captured the era better than what I've seen before.
