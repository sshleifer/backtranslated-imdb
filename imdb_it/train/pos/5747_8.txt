If you have some kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a difficult movie to watch, at least in the second part of it. <br /> <br /> It is in that segment where we see that a handsome little boy is beaten and then a retarded (mentally challenged) freaks out after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It is not a pleasant material. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and the acting is good too. The story will stay with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is the mentally disabled boy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this could be Hulce's best ever role. He is followed by a medical student, "Eugene", played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with "Field Of Dreams" by Kevin Costner. <br /> <br /> Dominick is a wealthy garbage who reads "Hulk" comics and loves wrestling. He's the kind of "slow" guy you can't help but love and root to live a happy life. When he's out of his mind, it's for many good reasons and ... well, watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be ready to go on the real emotional roller coaster and maybe be very upset about some things you see.
