This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It is a real pleasure for anyone. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and put you in suspension. <br /> <br /> Basically, what concerns Homeward Bound are three pets that are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what's going on and they desperately want to go home, run away from the farm and try to find their way home through nature. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films that Don Amène played. He gave the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden documentalist. In this film he also starred Sally Field, who provided the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is pretty much everything you expect from a lovable, playful, energetic and stupid dog, and every time I watch this movie, it's because of Chance ; it's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> Even this film is very sad sometimes. Sometimes it reminds people of the times they were alone or when they lose their pets. <br /> <br /> A scene that always puts me on hold is the scene in which the trio is trying to escape from the pound; In particular, I feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost can't do it. The film had other moments of suspense, but no one seems more suspenseful to me. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you will probably also like the sequel. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
