Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on a paradise island where they will be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple but at the same time outrageous and funny. Leave it to Fox to banish morality from the window and let the debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The nice thing about the show is that they weren't people who connected and manipulated each other for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple and the last test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People loved the show or hated it. It was a bit like slowing down to watch a terrible car accident. You know you shouldn't look, but you can't help but look. Apart from the drama, there was a lot of eye candy.
