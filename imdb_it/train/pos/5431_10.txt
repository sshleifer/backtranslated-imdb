I've seen this movie many times and every time I look at it I can't help but have fun. Gunga Din is one of those classic films made in the golden years of Hollywood when the actors themselves had to attract audiences in a film without relying on fantastic special effects and man-made "monsters" to bring a scene forward. The charisma on the screen and the camaraderie shown by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are superb and very fun to watch. The ironic and ironic attitude in which the three actors play their roles works perfectly and flawlessly. Some might consider it "trivial", but I consider filmaking and acting "classic" at its best. It must be remembered when watching this film that Europe was involved in a war with Germany and the public went to the cinema to escape the horrors of war and be entertained and taken to a place where people were bigger than life and they did heroic deeds and good would always conquer evil. Gunga Din is perfectly able to do this by letting the audience laugh and with the actors during their shocking escapades. In short, it's a classic movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't even want the public.
