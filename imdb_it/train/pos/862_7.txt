Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she finds herself overloaded at work, she is able to hire Paul to help her. Paul has just been released from prison and his past is not entirely behind him. To say much more about history, which has many twists and turns, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this film for me is how the sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when it is impossible - a sort of "listening point" (like the point of view). The first scenes that described it, as well as the initial development of the character of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than subsequent turns, some of which were difficult to follow and / or tended to increase credibility. There is also some unpleasant violence. Returning to the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing, but perhaps not looking. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 04/28/2002.
