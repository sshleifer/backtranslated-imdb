I took it out arbitrarily from the bookshop the other night, having no idea of ​​the cult, the influence of the film or the fact that it is currently on stage as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a little exploitative despite the directors' best intentions. The extended edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in the little Edie the fall of a class that has disappeared, you can also hear it in the old Jackie O movies; people don't talk like that anymore. I think, as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information on how the house fell into disrepute, Old Edie, at least, still seems aware of what is happening to some extent; Couldn't he see the house once spectacularly disintegrate? <br /> <br /> However, the subject of the film is the life that the two women have built for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams an act. It's worth your time.
