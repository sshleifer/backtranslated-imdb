Another classic study on the effects of wealth in a southern family is masterfully represented in Written on the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. You call it wealth, a plane. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always put him out of trouble. Mitch finished college, Kyle was kicked out. Mitch does not come from a wealthy home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls most of everything in the city. <br /> <br /> While in New York, Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, played by Lauren Bacall. After a whirling love story, the bride and he takes her home. There she meets her father-in-law who warns her how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow. The character of Bacall meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp, if there ever was, best played by Dorothy Malone, who was voted best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. <br /> <br /> A year of marital happiness for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by the doctor that he cannot have children. It's when his wife tells him he's really pregnant, Kyle, thinking the baby is from Mitch, goes into a drunken frenzy and is accidentally killed in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, but cannot blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable classroom scene, Malone did everything he could to admit that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. His Oscar was well deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was named best supporting actor and lost in a shocked victory for Anthony Quinn, playing Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was the master of 50s soap opera films. Written on the Wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
