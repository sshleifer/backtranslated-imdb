When I saw this show for the first time, I thought it was interesting. I saw it, I saw how it revolved around Sarah, as if the character saw the world ... turning around her. I understood it, but I didn't laugh much. <br /> <br /> On stage and in his show, he is racist, rude, insensitive and highly self-centered. At first I didn't take it and I took everything at face value. Then I saw his movie, Jesus is Magic. I think it was a Sarah Silverman primer for me, explaining just what 'language' is talking about. He's like Marilyn Manson, he works so hard to give us some horrible ideas and images, but in the end you understand that it's not an assault, it's a statement. And when you understand it, you discover that you are happy that someone has finally given you an explanation. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to suggest that only smart people will understand, or that hating this show is to prove your idiocy. While I like many "smart" shows, I still don't see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I have the impression that it is good, but I don't understand. Many people will never receive the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I arrived. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, each episode is loaded not only with dialogue and plot, but with songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. These people are not putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I were to predict the future of this show, I would say that it will be the end of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be deleted before it is now and live in the hearts of fans and on DVD. But come on, creators of SSP, your audience IS out there, and we'll watch until they let you do the show.
