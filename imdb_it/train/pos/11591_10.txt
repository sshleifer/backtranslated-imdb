I also tried to find this movie for a while, and how nice it would be to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old, in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed. It was shown before JUNGLE BOOK by Walt Disney! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this film is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was a friend of an eagle. This struck me a lot. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (he did not understand the reason). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped down. At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. Like an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
