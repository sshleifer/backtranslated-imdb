Critics did not like this film. He bombed in the United States and as a result received only a limited screening in Britain. Which was a real pity, because it represents British rather than American humor and should have been shown first in Britain. Nicole Kidman looks wonderful and is an absolutely convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman of "The Graduate", and "Birthday Girl" has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of the classic of the 60s (despite being a completely different story!). <br /> <br /> Of course it changes tack a number of times, from comedy to black comedy, from thriller to adventure - but it's memorable, moving and a breath of fresh air compared to the mega budget average blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Look at it with an open mind!
