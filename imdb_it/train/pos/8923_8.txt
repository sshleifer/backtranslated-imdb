The Blob is a classic science fiction movie from the 1950s of series cinema. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) see a meteor hit the ground, and when they go looking for it, they run into an old man with a strange ... blob attached to his arm. They take him to the clinic and then go to find out what happened. From there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path. The special effects are fun, like the story. There are many great touches, like the policeman playing chess with a policeman in another district. It is not a masterpiece, but it has a special place of its kind. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
