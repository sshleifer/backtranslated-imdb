Now that these days, some people don't see a film without film style, so many Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, have changed in what we expect in a movie, perhaps, Casomai is no-more-independent-non-American film, the film takes all the resources and language of films to tell us a simple story of love and marriage, but much more .. Fully of points of view, lectures and lets you think ... and I'm sure you can't fall in disgrace for a second of 116 minutes. I calculate that they don't have a single scene longer than 3 or 2 minutes and 1/2.
