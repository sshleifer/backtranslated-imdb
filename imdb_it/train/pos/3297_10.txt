The last tribute to a great film actress. The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen. How great poetry is timeless. Direction, cast, script, music, lyrics, in fact all the rules for the creation of films are perfectly chosen to satisfy the message of the film. The Muslim society in India has never been presented with such respect, nobility and reality. The script is memorable in the hands of Meena, Ashok, Raaj Kumar, Nadira etc. to name a few. Personally I was more impressed by the royal Kamal Kapoor. Master filmmaker Kamal Amrohi inherited the continent. A very beautiful film on a controversial topic that makes humanity appear and face the reality of the marginalized in the world. "In ka naam? Pakeeza! haan ​​Pakeza'.This acting has never been seen in this age of sex, dance and pornography.
