This great film failed to score more than 5. Why not! It is a great portrait of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensationalism of The Passion of Christ. Johnny Cash has done great things for God that are incredibly avoided and neglected in areas where they should be most important, like our churches. The film itself took less than a month to film while Johnny felt the strong presence of God that guided him through it. Great credit to all those involved in this overwhelmingly sincere film that will always be appreciated by its fans. At least Billy Graham's crusade assessed him well enough to use it as a primary source of education for new Christians. Thanks Fox for producing it. As Walk the Line showed that it was strange that this man had survived an undervalued masterpiece. The films are not canonized through the popular vote as this production demonstrates! In summary, I believe that this film is one of the great documentaries around the world as it is frank, honestly represented and a great witness of the Christian faith!
