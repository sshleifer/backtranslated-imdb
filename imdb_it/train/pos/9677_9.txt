This film seems to be on the surface a series of children's films that parents can unfortunately watch with their mostly amused children. The film seems and is mainly geared towards children, but does not stop at this level. I saw this film when I was little and I found it funny, funny and moving and I haven't seen it for several years. I looked at him again recently at the age of 18 and found it funny, but at the same time moving and fun. This film is very underrated and contains many real life messages. This film is an inspired research story that is made for children but epic in its own right. I recommend this film to anyone of any age.
