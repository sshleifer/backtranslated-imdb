There is certainly an emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship, based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also the emotion in the inner workings of Mathieu's family that deals with his mother's problems - and how this affects their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves many things unanswered (unless it's too stupid to take them). Why is Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? What led to the break-up of the boys? And the flash of return between past and present is a bit difficult to follow at first. It seems that the main reason to rent this film is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrill or some male nudity. But as a love story or a character study is lacking and unsatisfactory.
