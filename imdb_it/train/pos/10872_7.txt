The election marks the second theme movie for the test company directed by Johnnie To. <br /> <br /> To wonderfully punish Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, as the two members of the trial who were chosen as candidates for the position of president of the Ho Sing company, a trial company of 100 years. <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who keeps calm at all times, Big D is not only impatient, but also thinks he is at the top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next president for 2 years. To gain total control of the gang, the newly elected president must be transmitted with a dragon staff, which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next president after paying a handsome amount of bribes to board members. He ordered his man to take the stick before it fell into Lok's hands. <br /> <br /> While Big D is taking the stick, Lok has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the thematic films of the trial company where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of human beings in the film, where bloodshed is commonly used in other thematic films of the trial society to show how the greed of human beings can cause the death or ruin of one. However, no single bullet is used, almost no gang fight is involved in the elections. It is the battle of ingenuity that makes Elections stand out from others. <br /> <br /> In addition to Maggie Shiu, the only Election actress with less than 5 bars to speak in the entire film, masculinity dominates the entire film. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who was seen in To's previous film, are chosen as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the band respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors who make their appearance in the film and the excellent script, he makes the only Hong Kong film to represent the Cannes Fil Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> The elections have practically not failed critics who want a different process with a social theme.
