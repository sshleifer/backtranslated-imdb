I can safely admit (as an IMDb fanatic) that "Phantom Lady" will never enter my film noir top ten. It may not even enter the first fifty. But rather than discredit the film to not be as good as many other classics of the noir genre of cinema, it should be noted that "Phantom Lady" has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a useful vision. All that is required of the viewer is the ability to go beyond the terribly slow beginning. <br /> <br /> The film does not cook until the "Kansas" (Ella Raines) decides to try everything by itself the innocence of its leader, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night. As a novice investigator, he behaves quite well as he works on the streets of New York during the night. Gradually he begins to piece together pieces of a mysterious murder puzzle. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and it is only thanks to his presence that the film works well. Somehow he is able to give life to a film about a convict that is not the least interesting. I'm not sure this fragmented dynamic of a character without a personality becomes the fault of the actor or director, but clearly that's where something gets terribly wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines is as an inexperienced detective, things really accelerate into another hidden march when "Kansas" pays a late-night visit to a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of some information to help his convicted boss. She and the drummer paint the city of a new kind of red while visiting jazz clubs "all night". Trying to describe this scene will prove to be an injustice to the scene or, worse still, it could ruin the scene together. You will know the scene once the last plate crash has finished ringing. If you are lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, you will more than likely rewind this scene again and again. As Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film worthy of note. It is mainly because of this scene that I consider "Phantom Lady" a 7 instead of a 6. <br /> <br /> For the most part this film is presented as lukewarm and insipid with some great scenes and a magnificent scene. It is the "drum / sex scene" that separates this film from all others of the same genre. <br /> <br /> And just as in the film it is said that "you are never wrong with Vanilla", I would also like to add that "going with Vanilla" is the safe choice when you can't decide to have more treatment tasty. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
