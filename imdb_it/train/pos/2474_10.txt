There have been many things against this film for me before I watched it. <br /> <br /> Before I was a typical high school student, in a Shakespeare class that I didn't really like, much less understood than half of! Shakespeare would be nothing more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration into his almost-encrypted works ... encrypted with his extremely difficult language to understand ... and then again I wouldn't have gotten the most. <br /> Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought it could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you something. This film was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood the whole language as it was being performed. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this film, the same script that for me was incomprehensible in Shakespeare's class. And here I opened my mind and understood. I was doubting myself as I watched the movie almost! But here ... when it is performed, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare really is a master, who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the most important film style of the budget (with beautiful photography and photography), and acted surprisingly by Brannagh and the cast, somehow ... I realized what was happening. What was said. The language is fantastic and passionate. It allows more raw emotions ... when words can't describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can. <br /> <br /> I still stay today that Fist of The North Star (animated, English dub) is the best film ever made. No movie offers purer entertainment. But for a film that comes close to dethroning Pugno from that position (which Hamlet did - he came close) it's really surprising ... they inspire fear. It wasn't a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more surprising, it made me appreciate the shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. The word is powerful. One of the rare, REALLY powerful movies out there. <br /> <br /> This gets two hundred trillion stars from the stars of infinity. Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all of you guys out there in a Shakespeare class ... forget it. You're wasting your time. You must see the plays performed. Only then will justice be done to them.
