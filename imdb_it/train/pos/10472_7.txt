Anyone who loves Rheostatics music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, mainly about the rhythm and casting of some actors (not Maury) who aren't really convincing in their roles, but I don't have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or is planning to watch this film as presented on CBC television in Canada: The version that is broadcast is CBC is like the Reader's Digest version of WHAL MUSIC --- don't watch it. Cut out entire scenes and subplots (if you can) from the movie. The CBC, which features most of the films left untouched, pulled out half of the WHALE MUSIC's belly. I do not know why. What they did to the film is horrible. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but DO NOT watch it on CBC television.
