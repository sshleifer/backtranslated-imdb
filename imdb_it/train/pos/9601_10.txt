Darius Goes West is an extraordinary documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and her 11 friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if "Pimp My Ride" will release his wheelchair. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This film is an extraordinary story about the human spirit and spirit of Weem's friends. I don't say that often about movies, but after seeing this movie, I feel moved to do something about the cause. Every festival in which this film took part, this film won a prize of some kind. He is at the Tribeca Film Festival and will go to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this film reached the Academy Awards. He's going out of control. If anyone has the chance to watch this movie, wherever it is playing, go! Get as many people as possible and go! He is heading to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is originally from Georgia, so I expect that tickets for the Atlanta screening will be sold out quickly if they are not already. Please go see this movie!
