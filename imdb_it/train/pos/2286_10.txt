The people who produced this masterful film did a good service on a novel that represents perhaps the best fiction work focused on human guilt and human responsibility that has never been published. Nolte plays the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes it his own, remaining faithful to the portrayal of Vonnegut of a man who has lost EVERYONE (ae) out of love. <br /> <br /> No weakness in this good adaptation.
