This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was fun, fun and I love that it revolves around the holiday season. He's totally in the mood for Christmas shopping and listening to music for the holidays. When this movie is released on DVD, it will replace Christmas Vacation in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to make me want for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a little crazy, but I think he just adds to the movie and why he's so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a touch of love. I liked it. No, it's not Titanic and it won't make your heart beat faster with anticipation, but it will make you laugh or two. So go laugh and have fun :)
