This film could only have originated in the 70s !! It's a bizarre action movie set in a small California working class city. A kind of mill or plant is closing, so suddenly, unrestrained bad behavior is happening in the streets! The citizens are fed up! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a veterinarian from Vietnam who looks and acts a little out of balance. Hangs up with a group of other Vietnam veterinarians. They come to the city to clean it up (they become deputies), but beneath their good deeds, they are actually running casinos, asking for protection, etc. !!! It takes a while before people learn and, in a biblical showdown of Cain and Abel, Vincent has to take his older brother. There is an interesting atmosphere of unfair blue collar to this film, which makes it interesting (note the scene of the cockfight!). Is Vincent almost too angelic in this role ?? he thinks so well of his brother, he cannot conceive him to commit the bad deeds he is accused of. Finally back to his senses ?? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back and he is beaten at his house. Kris Kristofferson is frighteningly effective as Aaron. Coldly denies any misbehavior, and even gently speaks and talks to Vincent's young daughter (he refers to him as "Uncle Aaron") even while threatening his father's life, all the while smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance like a "saloon" that draws Aaron's attention. This is a nice action movie from the 70s, if you can find it !! NOT yet available on DVD ??
