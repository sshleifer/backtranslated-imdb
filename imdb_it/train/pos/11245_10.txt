I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980, and thought it would be one of the "Movie Classics". This film is a great look in the music industry with a cast of great performers. This is a film that should be in everyone's collection and of anyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can't wait for it to be available on DVD.
