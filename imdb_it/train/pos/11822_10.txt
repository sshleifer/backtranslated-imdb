Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I must admit to those who have not seen it. You will really love it or really hate it. It was released a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were disappointed simply because the plot was so simple. But it's based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creatively, this film is fantastic! The sets, the make-up, the music, the costumes and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and bad language - it's a rare thing these days. Directed, produced and played by Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as seductive breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. It has the best linings I have heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the best things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic book. This film is really a piece of art that is sadly overlooked by the public. To sum up, this film brings out the child in all of us. It's a movie that will leave you smiling in the end.
