This is definitely an appropriate update to the original, except that "the party on the left is now part on the right". Like the original, this film lashes out against a federal government that goes beyond its limits with regards to personal freedom. It is a warning of how weak our political freedoms are in an era of too zealous and too powerful a federal government. Kowalski acts as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, with the cooperation of the mainstream media, has thrown words like "white supremacist" and "right-wing extremists, as well as invented drug accusations to shorten the most fundamental of the its citizens' rights, with the desired acquiescence of the general population. This message is so non-PC, I am amazed that this film can be made - at least not without bringing the federal government through the IRS to the creators as they did with Juanita Broderick , Katherine Prudhomme, the Western Journalism Center and countless others who have dared to speak. "Live Free or Die" is the motto on Jason Priestly's hat that brilliantly portrays "the voice" and sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film . <br /> <br />
