This film is proof that the film noire is a lasting style and extremely worthy of staying alive. For me, it's the best example of a noir film since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it will never get the recognition it deserves. He was never promoted correctly when he was released for the first time and had to build his fan group through places like Vanguard Cinema and word of mouth word of mouth. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that people look for something more entertainment rented this film and deepened its highly twisted plot.
