Please, are you all tired of Todd Sheets!?! We give $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you think! The boy has 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for FREE! Of course the acting is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, makeup is not the best you can ever see. But it's not even the worst, if you want to see it, look at Zombie Nation with its zombie raccoons. <br /> <br /> This is pure, good old fashioned Guerilla Film-making! Todd is a consummate professional and a good guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems unlikely. What the hell, I love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and remake what he was about to do. If anyone has ever tried to make a film, they know that just finishing it is a result in and of itself.
