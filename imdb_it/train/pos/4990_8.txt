As other reviewers have noted, this is a film of the era of depression unfairly overlooked. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leaving him in heaven, The Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.), It is a tenacious move, well structured and carried out on inhabitants of a slum in New York. They are beggars, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of people both good and bad, with complex loyalties like those of any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps among the many admirable qualities of this film is the contrast between the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill, and Trina of Loretta Young. He speaks hard, physically aggressive and obviously without fear, but Bill is not the character that gives this film its sense of survival. While it freezes, Trina really freezes (if that term can be applied to such a stately character). His devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll raise it by herself if she wants to leave, or "I'll give up on the baby if you're just happy." Such is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20) as a rather simple character, who seems neither weak nor dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing else.
