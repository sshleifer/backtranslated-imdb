The arrival of a world-famous conductor of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way the church choir is run and by the way people gradually change. This film is moving and makes you get out of the cinema with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about getting the best out of people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas that made him famous. The actors are exceptional, Michael Nyqvist we know before, but Frida Hallgren was a new and fascinating knowledge for me. He has a very vivid face that leaves no one intact. For Moberg he plays almost the same part as Gabriella's husband, he too is horrible. One would just like one day to be chosen to play a good guy, so we can see if he also masters that character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you intact. If you haven't already seen it, do it today!
