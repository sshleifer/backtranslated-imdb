I disagree with anyone who didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do it. It's sweet, fun and warms your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although he didn't have much of a story, it was still excellent. I give him an inch and two at the top. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and prove that your deepest desires and dreams can come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this film, personally if someone says it is sucked of what I will say "Shame". Because it was a lovely little movie and I'm glad that at least SOME users liked it.
