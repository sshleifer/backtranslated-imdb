Together with "Aparadektoi, the best series of Greek comedies ever!" Lefteris Papapetrou and Antonis Aggelopoulos writes in a magnificent way Soso, Alekos, Flora, Achilleas, grandfather Aristide, Machi, Johnnie, Corrina and Michalis! In a nutshell, Alekos, a Butcher who lives in a district around the center of Athens is married to Soso. One day he meets Flora, an old date of his, who is now married to Achilleas and lives with his father-in-law and his caretaker, Machi. also has a son named Johnny who appears at the end of the first period and the entire second, the remaining main characters are Michalis, Alekos's assistant to the butcher and bisexual and Corrina, the lost sister of Achilleas who has become the best prostitute from all over Athens. The main plot of the series is Soso who tries to kill Alekos, because he is betraying her, but everything else is not of minor importance. A brilliant script, with an excellent plot, poisonous quotations, aw esome shows and a great director. The original idea and above all the filming was something that was done for the first time on Greek television, for a series of Greek television, eg. scenes shot underwater! Definitely a serial that will never stop enjoying you!
