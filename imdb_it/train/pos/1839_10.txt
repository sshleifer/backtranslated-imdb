An excellent film about two policemen who love the same woman. One of the policemen (Périer) killed her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unfortunate Montand doesn't know who the other lover could have killed her, and Périer doesn't even know that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must definitely find the killer ... and what a great ending! Highly recommended.
