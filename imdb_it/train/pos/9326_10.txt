I have to be honest and say that I bought this film, not because of the content, but because there are David Cubitt; I know ... superficial, or what? - but, come on, Mr. Cubitt is a fantastic actor to say the least. <br /> <br /> I didn't really know what to expect watching this movie, I would read the other one, and those on other sites, but I must say that I was attracted to the world of brothers almost from the beginning. David Cubitt in the role of Theo and Colm Feore in the role of Ryan are as credible as the two strangers, the film moves through their relationship as they start trying to get to know each other again after the death of their fathers. The scene where Theo discovers that Ryan is gay has been played brilliantly, literally enters the scene and tries to leave without Ryan noticing, which he obviously has. <br /> <br /> The film has been very well studied and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in parts. I moved away from this feeling of sadness for what Ryan lived, but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the former drug addict brother Theo. I agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene in which Theo says he will be a moving father, and I would go a little further to say that I actually vocalized my thoughts to Ryan when he cruelly tells Theo 'What do you makes you think you can be a father 'and Theo simply says' You'. Theo then leaves, but that little exchange of dialogues speaks of Ryan's almost compassionate appearance, which is sharply reported by simple reply. <br /> <br /> A brilliantly conceived film on all fronts, acting, directing, writing etc. they are all so well done. I really can't find anything else to say about this movie, except to say that it's very difficult to deal with the death of a loved one, but this is done superbly, ad infinitum. Respect for the subject and the outpouring of love (without being contrite and sweetened) speaks in this rather selfish world in which we live today. Well done to all concerned. <br /> <br /> Not many films bring me to tears and give me a break to think about life in general, and also to be happy with all the things I have and not be sad about things I don't, but this movie worked, it was incredibly encouraging considering the topic.
