I saw this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I saw the movie as if it weren't connected to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and saw what happens to most books when they are made into films, so I developed a philosophy very soon. Suppose the film is based on the book (or the musical in this case) but while the plot may be similar it will not be the same, it will be different so watch it for what it is. <Br /> <br /> I danced for 12 years before having to make a choice. I was a good dancer (gathering choir work in local productions as a child, etc.) but I wasn't very talented. I was still very talented as a show driver. I was told by my dance instructor and my coach (that I spent several months a year on his farm outside the state) that I had to make a choice when I turned 14 years old. That I needed to go from dancing two hours four to five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicated to one or the other. So I love dancing and I love this movie and many other dance and dance films. I just chose to watch this film for what it is, it's a great film about raw emotions and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work hard to get something you want and simply don't understand. I love the movie. I love the Broadway musical.
