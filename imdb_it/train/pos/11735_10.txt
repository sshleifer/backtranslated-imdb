This film is pure Elvira and shows it at her breast ... I mean better! The story (written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is stimulating and captivating and is animated by the intelligence and charm of Elvira. The viewer has the opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to watch her aunt Morganna's readings) and at the same time look for helping suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the city council. He also has to do with his attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who has his eyes on Bob, but he is not as deserving of his love as Elvira. And, later in the film, she also addresses the complications of being descended from "a great metaphysical celebrity" and the witchcraft accusations brought against her, which means that she will be burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while she plays down jokes and delivers off-beat lines with double meanings. <br /> <br /> This film is inspiring because it conveys the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams have finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this extraordinarily unique and determined woman. I've seen this movie countless times and I never get tired of doing it! There are no useless scenes and I found myself fascinated throughout the film. A review will not do the film proper, so I can only tell you to watch it because it is one of the best films ever made! Meanwhile, I wish you "unpleasant dreams!"
