I approach films to talk about animals with care. For every wonder like Babe, you get one just as poor as the terrible Homeward Bound remake: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film that does not respect its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a witty parrot didn't fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And he manages to sneak into your heart without you noticing. <br /> <br /> A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) finds work in a research laboratory. One day he hears the song coming from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in his cage that sings his little heart. Misha is fascinated by the bird, especially when she discovers that the parrot can't just sing, she can talk. And not a few sentences either. It's a parrot that you can actually talk to. <br /> <br /> The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr) and recognizes another shipwrecked in Misha. Wondering how this world ended up being the wise bird in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him her life story. It all started when he was small, and in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl with a stutter. The two became feather birds (OK, bad pun!). When Marie's parents worried about her close friendship with a bird, they thought of sending him away. And finally they did after Marie almost hurt herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, who fly great distances and even end up behind bars. Of a cage that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of the many talking animal films produced by DreamWorks in the late 1990s. And although he has not been granted Babe's own box office recognition or success, Paulie has reached several levels, and it is an occasional work of surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand up style acting fits well with Paulie's part. He never plays the part as smug, even though he's a little smart Aleck. Paulie is worldly, but he is also naive in his way. <br /> <br /> Because he lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he is taken away, he has to look after himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of several owners, they make promises to Paulie to rejoin him with Marie, who he believes. Only for those promises that will be interrupted over and over again. <br /> <br /> Paulie is certainly a bit episodic. It follows the eclectic people with whom Paulie ends and how he slowly approaches Marie. First he runs into a pawnshop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kind woman who teaches him the meaning of good manners. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and drives a motorhome across America to find Marie. Paulie is a film sometimes very touching. His scenes with Ivy are among the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on his shoulder singing the numbers of Tom Jones. The way he instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogues are written quite well and even stimulating: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life you postpone, because you think you will do them more late, but the real thing Ivy taught me is that you have to live as if there were not a second later. "<br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy dies to leave Paulie alone is a very heartbreaking moment. And the sequence in which he takes the courage to fly for the first time through the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a wonderfully composed scene that he stays with you for hours after the film ends. <br /> <br /> Despite the occasional sad moment, there are lots of laughs to have. Paulie enters with a group of parrots performing in an outdoor Spanish restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent, as four birds perform a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie also gets to have a love story. Which is dashed when it falls into a petty thief (also played by Mohr). This could be the only complaint I have. As soon as you feel comfortable with one situation, the film moves Paulie to another. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is fun, but also a little creepy. I'm amazed that DreamWorks has been given the opportunity to include such a scene in a children's movie. And Paulie's diamond robbery is really impossible. He is caught red-handed and sent to the animal testing lab, where he has remained ever since. <br /> <br /> The story finally gets to the starting point at the lab, where Misha swears to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was numb for several minutes. Paulie may never have Babe's longevity, but I think it is an equally brilliant film. The same laughter. The same impeccable effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A minor gem.
