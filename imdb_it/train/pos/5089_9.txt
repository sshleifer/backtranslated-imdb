True, it doesn't follow the book closely, but it's still a very fun way of telling the story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided the "stupid woman out of his depth in the wild" that most of us probably expected (see Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom"). <br /> <br /> In any case, it's incredibly better than Richard Chamberlain's terrible pair of flip Quatermain. <br /> <br /> Very reminiscent of a western in many ways. The only thing I didn't care for was all mysticism, but I think it's an integral part of the genre. How "how can you have an African adventure story without the witches and preternaturally wandering tribes?" Eh.
