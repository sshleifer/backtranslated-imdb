Let me first say that although I have seen every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or a Trekkie. Those are people who live in their parents in the cellar and attend conventions wearing costumes with sharp rubber ears. I gave this film a seven apart from the historical errors of fiction. The acting was better than average, but the plot didn't surprise. They tried very hard to decode the technology, but the special effects were just a big temptation. Now, as for the historical errors, if you call them that, the first Captain to pilot the Enterprise was Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk we discovered the Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (this is the reason why a primary directive was created), but as I said these are not reasons to discredit this beautiful series. I hope the plots will get deeper, so the special effects can go back to the background.
