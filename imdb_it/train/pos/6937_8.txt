This exciting western shoots the story of the famous rifle of the first west that was coveted by all. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout, only to lose it in a robbery. The story describes Stewart's search for the gun and a man through the film. The rifle changes hands from time to time, as if the owner was destined to lose it with violence. The image has a lot of action and suspense as Stewart approaches his prey. A great cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems uncomfortable here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, young drivers in recent years, have short but good roles.
