I saw the whole movie last night and found it very exciting. At least, not like teenage movies that pop up every once in a while. The search for the murderer and the 'partner' relationship between the hero and the so-called bad boy was a part I liked about the film. Also, I remember being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie. I mean it's exciting. Maybe some time later, I could watch the movie again. ..
