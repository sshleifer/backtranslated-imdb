The first review I saw of Page 3 said "what does madhur bhandarkar finally mean?" It should say something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Page 3 is that it doesn't take a stand. No propaganda whatsoever. This is the film that captures so many aspects of a problem (I don't know how I call it a "problem" here) and yet, like any mediocre film, it doesn't find a solution. I was so fascinated when I realized that the film ended up almost in the same scenario just as it started. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters who have completely different priorities and ideologies yet they are all a part of the system that is all the more apathetic. I wish I could say more but there would be more spoilers ahead. So see if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
