I absolutely LOVE this movie and I'd really like to have it someday. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and I'd love to see it again! I don't remember too much about this, but that a native American boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but it's supposed to come out alone in the desert. His sister prepares food for him and he goes. While out there, some other Indian boys come running and put feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you see an eagle with a turquoise necklace, it's the boy. I've always been fascinated by legends, especially Native American legends, and I'd like to see it published one day on a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE it, anyone interested!
