That hilarious line is typical of what these nasty sisters say. (It's fun in its own way and rather amusingly even unintentionally.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, they are bad too! One is given to postman poses and salacious comments where she goes. The other gets up to look like Marilyn Monroe. He has those sensual, slightly open lips. And, in order not to give anything, it is even worse than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters are interpreted by stars. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had a kind of career. <br /> <br /> Today it seems possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever commercialized. Well, certainly not the first but the most hoarse in that moment. <br /> <br /> The girls dress as little as possible and let's not forget the members of the female audience: Bromfield shows himself shaving with an electric razor - of which was the fetish? - bare-chested. He also shows himself wet in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is also a real plot: the girls' family, look, is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or to the dramatic deaths that can be made to look like suicide. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad. I really don't know where it was shown. Maybe it was created for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I heard that the typical male audience was not the main focus here. Women are dressed succinctly. They often look like magazine covers like Police Detective or jackpot jackets for ten cents. <br /> <br /> But the boy seems to be the center of attention. He doesn't like everyone, but all the girls love him. And I think the public is too. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and in its own way.
