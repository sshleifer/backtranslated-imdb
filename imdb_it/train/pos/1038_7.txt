I liked the movie. I also liked most of the actors. But, for me, the very poor attempt of Mrs. Davis's accent, and her rigid acting, make it really hard to watch an otherwise irresistible film. Seriously if some other modern actor played the same role in the same style as Ms. Davis, they would be mocked by the screen. I really think he "phoned this." Now, if Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman played the part of the wife, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I guess I don't have "Bette Davis". I have always thought of her as an actor who "plays herself" regardless of her role. The possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many of the other reviewers will carefully (and I hope civilized) explain how I am wrong about this. But I will continue to watch the films in which he is present because I like the supporting stories / scripts / casts, but I will always think of different actresses who could have done a better job.
