I saw ZP when it was released for the first time and I found it a big disappointment. The script seemed forced, arched and too fake in the 1960s. It's too early and ridiculous a policy. And let's face it, I was still under a love spell known as BLOWUP: and I haven't completely shaken it yet. Now "love" is twisted with all sorts of nostalgia that it evokes and, oh well. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time passes and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher for me. I reviewed this film every ten years and it gets better with age. And ZP is his "experience" and is really tied to BLOWUP only through its creator, the great, Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I had the great fortune of seeing an absolutely pristine print product, projected to its right size (immense), restored by an Italian governmental cultural agency that knows a good work of art when he sees it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing in shape. Until today I remember the jolt of the public when the first blow of Death Valley appeared. It was like a visual shock of a thousand volts that Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is a completely different type of "place". <br /> <br /> What amazes me is how this film is becoming a reality. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time seeing it --- the early 80s --- I had started feeling affection for the film as a whole and for Daria and Mark in particular. While before these two seemed an elegant shadow version of Zefferelli, Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet), now they were involving me, in particular The Girl in her insistence slo-motion. He took his time. . . To live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around her. <br /> <br /> After thrilling the theater, the light of day of reality has quickly begun to erase my new-found "enjoyment". The shocking 80s with short, frizzy hair whispered "But that's a hippie fantasy --- forget it" <br /> <br /> The strength of Antonioni's vision had, I realized, already worked inside me the FIRST time around so I answered "80s" with a "Uh-Huh" and kept my "love" secretly, possessively and jealously. <br /> <br /> But, this, then it is what good art lives within you and, if you want it to have its way and "love you", go back: secretly, jealously and possessively. And you have "changed". <br /> <br /> He was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March line. Undoubtedly, ZP must be seen on a giant screen so that it can really take you into its built environment. But, hey, sometimes even just a taste of the Amati in a photo of a newspaper is no better than nothing. <br /> <br /> Today a hit of reality, ZP has been mysteriously withdrawn and replaced with the antics of the restaurant ALICE'S RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> So, is it still too "difficult", even "disturbing", even "what"? <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is so, as with all good art, Lives while everything dies around it. <br /> <br /> Peace.
