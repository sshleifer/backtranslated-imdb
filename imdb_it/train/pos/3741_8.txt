The war drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971. There follows a group of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland - an accurate portrait of Vietnam on American soil, before they are shipped. He focuses on two men: Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends and deal with a squadron squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a borderline psychopath (Shea Wingham). <br /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. Use a camcorder for most of the movie and use digital video for the fight scenes. It works very well - the film looks gritty (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers his Irish accent and adopts a fairly convincing southern accent. His performance is simply superb: he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not so nice. He is tall, muscular, very handsome and very sweet. The rest of the cast, however, is simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> This film was thrown out of his studio. He had no stars, a family history and was considered "just another war movie". He only played a week in Boston! It is worth taking videos or DVDs. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Farrell and Davis have a long nude scene.
