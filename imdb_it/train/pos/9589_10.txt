Growing up in New York in the late 80s / early 90s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made to cover that place at this time. The idea of ​​Voguing didn't come to Madonna, but that's where she got it! Instead of bringing out violence against each other or in cat fights, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the confines of everything that didn't touch each other (which would justify an automatic disqualification) . Seeing these extraordinarily talented / well-orchestrated types of "throw-downs" in clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names of that day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc ... all commemorated in songs of the caliber of "Deep in Vogue" by Malcom McLaren ... it didn't matter who you were, or where you came from, because when you passed through those doors in this "magical realm" of sorts, you became part of something bigger than you / you were important / and above all the creation of your moves and your imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become King (or Queen), as the case may be. Words and spirit were just as acute as moves on the floor. All the tension, excitement and magic of that urban energy of New York are captured in this film. BRILLIANT!!! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD FOR THE WORLD TO SEE !!! Thank you!
