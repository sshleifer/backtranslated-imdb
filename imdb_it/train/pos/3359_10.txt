A special day is a film that made a brilliant use of enclosed spaces. It is in these empty and empty spaces that the public sees the emotional turmoil and exuberant explosions of the two protagonists of Ettore Scola. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for a few brief moments of their lifeless lives. It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will line up with characters close to them. All the men would really feel sorry for the character of Sophia Loren. women would certainly have screamed their hearts at the existential situation of Marcello Mastroianni. Masked sexualities are also one of the key issues of this dark and moving film. Most of the characters deal with issues related to their sexuality. A particular day cannot be defined as a pro gay movie even though it has been well depicted that a homosexual type mixes well with women. This is a film for which the Italian director Ettore Scola has created a discreet mix of facts and fiction. The idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler has changed the fate of Italian municipalities. A word about the courageous character magnificently played by the great Marcello Mastroianni. He behaves like a real man, don't beg for mercy. He happily accepts his destiny and prepares to face the worst moment of his short but significant life. A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
