This is a trio of short stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali", on an experimental commune (or something like that) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which carried people on their way into the realm of the unknown, and I left a little bit of damage here and there, I would say. Many years later some of those damages are still lurking and waiting for the right time to show up. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, was torn to pieces, and the suspect was a man who perhaps did not exist. It seems that this woman is able to project an inner demon, or so she discovers the sister of the man who was killed when she tried to talk to this woman while pretending to be a journalist. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". He's a skinhead, a speed freak, and he's sent to see a psychiatrist who seems to be a former member of this commune, which translates into the good doctor who helps the young man realize his wish. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer, who tries to "heal" this woman who was part of this commune and frees a sort of demon that lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did or if he broke it because he could no longer survive in her. All three of these stories are pretty scary and full of suspense because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premises and settings are so different from those of conventional horror films that adds to the oddity. This has a sort of low-budget aspect, but it also manages to create a rather scary atmosphere everywhere, so much for its merit. I saw it with my mouth open for most of the time and when the real fear (and blood) came it hit pretty hard. I found this film very interesting and disturbing and I loved it. I would give it a nice discovery 8 out of 10.
