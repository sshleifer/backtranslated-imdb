I advise you to watch this movie with your significant other if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so smoky that it could cloud your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to each other and to the jungle. Jane's jungle attire and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers their visitors illuminates that they are not only romantically, but also sexually in love. <br /> <br /> Someone's imagination can complement the constant love contact between Tarzan and Jane to portray how effectively Jane is teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing, but is also prospering with her previously untapped sexuality. <br /> <br /> The leather show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece, two-legged, sexy two-piece swimsuit, she also has a naked swim underwater with Tarzan. (although it's not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim doubling for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pecs in her thong just there. The ladies will be delighted when Weissmuller emerges from the water after the long battle with the giant crocodile and his shout resounds - with his loincloth soaked in water that he practically falls from his hips. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the over-protection the censors mitigated the adult nature of Tarzan's films after this rumor. Although Weissmuller Tarzan's films continued to thrive in the years to come, they would rarely come close to the sex appeal of this film.
