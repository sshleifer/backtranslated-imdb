I do not want to reveal anything by describing the plot of this film except to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and friend has just committed suicide. It takes place like a detective story while the blind woman tries to understand why her friend has ended her life. As he pursues his investigation and information accumulates, he leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is expert and the acting, in particular of Talia Sharon in the role of Yaara, the blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film has certainly come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the United States.
