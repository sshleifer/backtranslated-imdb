I expected this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which is why I left it unseen for so long, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a succession of foolish battles with guns and car / boat chases, it was an almost weighted analysis of how a beautiful girl becomes as hard as nails, with nothing exaggerated or excessively rationalized. <br /> <br /> It is likely that the budget constraints actually helped me: less time and effort was spent on finding increasingly stupid ways for the stuntmen to pretend to die, and others were dedicated to making the movie worth seeing. Hell, the biggest firefight takes place off the screen - and the scene in which it's heard is even better for that background noise, which adds suspense - who's winning? Who's dying? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as wonderful as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire needed to make the character work - and the shape of her face, her hair and his tall, slender body could have been lifted directly from the comic graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a bad boy from Blaise, in which he made the character interesting and fun to watch - even sympathetic (and I doubt I would consider many brutal and psychopathic murderers as drinking companions). I can't think of one of the Hollywood "ex-waiters" who could have canceled the role. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the villains of Blaise always die in the end (there are no spoilers!). a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time fainting on such a disgustingly beautiful and interesting piece can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes.
