I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit difficult to do it when your brother makes you stupid comments in 30 seconds. But I liked this movie, especially because I'm used to the usual HK action films. Most movies like this don't look at her for the plot, they look at her for mindless action. And the unreasonable action is right. You can see Jet Li Jump, shoot, kick, hit, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this film was released to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the reviews on this film have decreased. Most people probably expected to see a film that was as glossy as a North American film. But it must be remembered that most HK film budgets are not as good as those of a North American film, and the style of an HK action film is usually very different and usually requires networking many of them. If you want to see a good action movie you should see this just to try to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My vote was 8.
