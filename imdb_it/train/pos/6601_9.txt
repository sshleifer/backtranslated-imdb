This film is absolutely stunning. A new Blade Runner: the future noir is more aggressive. The vision of Paris is superb, recognizable and visionary, with breathtaking views, ramshackle scenery and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the film. It's a visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> Done in 3D and rendered in black and white (without grays!) with just one small patch of color, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many "artistic" shots - close-ups and odd points of view - but that only adds to the film's temperament. Overall, one gets the impression of a graphic novel in the form of a film. At first I had the impression that the film had been rotated, as was the level of animation and the high detail of the character's facial expressions. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly" - which suffers (or indeed has improved) by defining the incoherent character (it is enough to observe how the hair changes a bit!) - The Renaissance is consistent and precise everywhere. When the character is in the foreground, the added details and plot can be seen, but when mid-field or other details are omitted, but not at the expense of defining the character. <br /> <br /> For me, the only downside of the film is that in a commentary we are told that it is a unique project. Really a pity, since I'd like to see more of this futuristic film-noir plot and especially in this avant-garde graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and even the English dub is fantastic. <br /> <br /> All in all a fantastic and highly recommended film.
