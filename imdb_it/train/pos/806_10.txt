Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> the best Star Wars ever. is the first film I've ever seen Sean. The bad guys win and it's a great ending. it really made me wait for the next star wars, because in this film you meet the things you got to find out more in the last movie. With most movies I always get the feeling that it could be the bed but not this. and I will never forget the part the waders were Luke, it's his father. It's too beautiful. I also love the figure of Bob feat a back ground player. if you've never seen a star wars movie, go to her this. it's the best. <br /> <br /> thanks Lucas
