This is an excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school that was very similar to this. There are many "facts" in the story that are not entirely true and Mr. Wuhl points them out very well, in a way that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but students of history and even the general public will appreciate the witty way in which he discovers some very well known errors in the history of the world and strives to impress them on that brain of his students. Even the use of live actors performing "skits" is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the story they learned as a flipped child.
