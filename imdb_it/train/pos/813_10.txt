After "The Empire Strikes Back" "The Return of the Jedi" is my second favorite movie in the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is secretly building a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station remains totally built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient due to the delay of the new Death Star, and they need to kill many of their commanders to get the project planned. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's building to send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. Give R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the deal, since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace decoration. (Han is still frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also given to Jabba by a rewards hunter. When the same hunter tries to save Han by himself and makes him stay in human form again, we see that in reality it is Princess Leia in disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave, while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca's cell. <br /> <br /> Luca comes as a Jedi knight to save his friends. On his first attempt to kill Jabba, he falls into the monstrous cell of Jabba (Bantha), but easily kills him. Jabba remains angry and decides to launch Han, Chewbacca and Luke at Sarlacc, a large desert creature that continues to digest its "food" for 1,000 years. Luke, Han and Chewie succeed again in the scape, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him into Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and also chases Han, Luke and Chewie and c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since she is already 900 years old, and before she dies, Yoda tells Luke that she doesn't need further training, but to really be a Jedi, she has to fight Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's father and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luca to remember his advice on the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke to pass on his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies, Obi wan's spirit is revealed to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more a machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke remains worried about killing his own dad and says he feels his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated from the children. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Vader that he must give him Luke when he shows up, since Luke is stronger than before, and both need to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side. <br /> <br /> We are now going to have one of the best battles in the Star War series, when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the "Death Star 2", Luke will face Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie must turn off the "Death Star 2" power field with the help of the EWOKS. (small creatures that look like teddy bears) <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the most exciting Star Wars of all!
