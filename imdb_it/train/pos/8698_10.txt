I saw this movie when it came out and I've enjoyed it since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film). I really enjoyed seeing the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a blast. The script is clever, sly and ironic, making fun of almost everything "Beverley Hills". The "doctor" loved by Paul Bartel and the servant of Ray Sharkey. This was vulgar and raw, but thank god! Unless you are an idiot, I highly recommend this movie. FYI for those who like to play at six grades of Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were in "Night of the Comet" together. All three were in "Eating Raoul".
