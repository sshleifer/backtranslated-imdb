Three sergeants from the British army stationed in India are sent to stop a revolt by a tribe of assassins known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leaves the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees led by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the regiment's water boy, returns to the camp for help and the other two sergeants chase him, but are also captured. Now the major sends a complete detail after the three, but does not realize that they are walking in a trap set by the Thugees. However, it is Gunga Din that saves the day. A well-made friend film, even if today it is politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very funny and thrilling performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and very sinister Cianelli as Guru. Rating: 10 out of 10.
