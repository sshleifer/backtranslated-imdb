This is the kind of film that England can do in sleep, and that's the meaning of a compliment. Due to the success of British costume comedies located at the end or beginning of the twentieth century, particularly the adaptations of the novels of EM Forster, this production like that of Merchant-Ivory was accepted into the light that it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, after she appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers that her husband had an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as an IRA terrorist who eventually wears a wig and gets a bad shit in THE CRYING GAME. Here she plays a quiet and serene woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a journey full of discoveries. They are joined by an unlikely pair of women: a Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who looks a lot like a vampire Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This quartet will end up blending together becoming deep friends just because the story is so full of spring and an overwhelming and dreamy sweetness that it almost pre-orders it, but that's fine; is the film he wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to the American public) complete the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and overall, Mike Newell makes his film a living element of almost magical elements, full of quiet moments and I ask .
