As far as I know, the real actor who is playing the main actor saw his performance and said it was an exceptional portrait, I agree with him. This is a fantastic movie about a pretty gifted guy / man with a special body part that helps him. Oscar winner and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis, plays Christy Browna, a man paralyzed by cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and transported to his family. He has a special left foot though, he can write with it, paint with it and keep things with it. Learn to talk later in the movie, it's very good for a guy like him. He also starred with Brenda Fricker, an Oscar nominee, and Oscar winner and Oscar winner, while Mrs. Brown and the BAFTA won Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Screenplay, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Film, was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film, Best Makeup Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was the number 85 of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, was number 20 of the 50 Greatest British Actors, was Britain's No. 9 Finest Actors, and was number 15 on The Greatest Actor in the world, and the film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Awesome!
