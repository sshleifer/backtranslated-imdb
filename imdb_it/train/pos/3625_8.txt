This is the best image of baseball since Redford beat The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seem real enough to drag you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Laced with dreams - dripping into reality, the American Dream rekindles after 9/11 with a true story of the middle-aged Devil Ray debutant, Jimmy Morris. The Australian actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a West Texan native better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection ?? cast as the aspirant, gonnabe and humble winner with psychological baggage as much as the average spectator of the public It's true. The chemistry on the screen works. If you like heart warmers for baseball, you will love this movie. The ingredients for the American and the apple pie were all in there. My popcorn has become the "fashionable way". <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! The music swings and brings the story beautifully! Synchronizing words and music pushes the story forward exactly as it should, an area that disappoints me very often. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would have given the ball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about "character" and heart. Saint Rita and the nuns were a beautiful decoration, but they never found their place in history to open and close around them. A little long Worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
