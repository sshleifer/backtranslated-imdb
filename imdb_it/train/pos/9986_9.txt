As perhaps one of the few Canadians who didn't read the book in high school, I thought I'd add my comments. Watching the film without knowing the story in advance did not detract from the film. The characters have so many complexities, everyone can relate to them in his own way. The splendor of adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their perceptions about the lives of the characters, rather than being fed spoonfuls of an opinion. You can love them or not love them, and still feel the emotional impact of the film. The wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne give life to the characters. I would highly recommend it.
