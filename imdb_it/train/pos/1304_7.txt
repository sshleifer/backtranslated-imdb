All right. Yes, this was a film with a very limited budget with errors of continuity (like individual scenes obviously turned to the sun and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso he was often a little too good at burning - apart , and some of the minor support casts were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely insipid and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Funny? Great yes. I would have liked to have been on the set the day they decided what type of hairstyle Grieco would have. "You are fast?" ... "You're not that fast."
