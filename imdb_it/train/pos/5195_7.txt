As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit paydirt with this. The plot is not so bad, but there are some cases where you really have to ask yourself "what the hell is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this the funniest ugly movie ever. First of all, Rudy Ray Moore had become so fat and slow when this film was made that the special effects consisted of speeding up the fighting scenes to double the time. There are also scenes in which there is an instant slow-motion replay, jumping on a ten-foot high wall (playing falling from it backwards), naked men coming out of huge letters and sex that literally breaks down the roof (with the cable keeping the roof on fire). <br /> <br /> Obviously, no Rudy Ray Moore film would be complete without a completely free and casual club comedy scene in which Rudy makes fun of all the customers, interposed with people by doing some strange dance. There are so many bad things in this movie, but they are bad in a fun way, and if you take your eyes off the movie, you may miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for actual value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for selection of errors and goofs, on average at 7/10.
