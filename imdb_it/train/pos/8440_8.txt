This is the final episode we deserved. At the end of last season, things remained in a 'continuous life' mood, which was certainly not the conclusion that this realistic series deserved. While not a happy show, this series has always been the one that made you think (a rare thing on television), and this is no exception. "Is death justified by reasoning?" "Is morality a reflection of society, or is society shaped by the morality chosen by the few in power?" "What is a just death, and can it exist?" All these questions, and more, are asked by the writers of this show every week, and this is their final thesis. Fine acting, excellent script, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you've seen the series and missed this when it was first released, pick up a copy in some way. If you have never watched the series while running, then this will stand alone, but it might be difficult to try to keep up with who all the characters are and what they allude to in their various pasts. For those of us who have been avid spectators of the series in the last two seasons, this is a very satisfying view.
