This is the only movie I saw Prince, but it doesn't matter. And I thought he was very good at singing, boy, I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is fantastic. That's why he won the Oscar in 1984 for the best music for a film (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and a Grammy to his credit. Even if the expletives interfere with the film (make sure they are not children or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should really go out and get this movie, your collection is not complete unless you brought us this movie. What else could I say except to go and get this movie now!
