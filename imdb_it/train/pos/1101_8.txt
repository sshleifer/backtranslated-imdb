While prices have gone up a lot, and some details have become obsolete, every home owner who has difficulty with home ownership problems should get a lot of laughs from this movie. I know I did it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, a New York advertising executive, decides to move his family to the outskirts of Connecticut and build a nice house there. He runs into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties, since the costs and the construction program continue to grow without control. I thought the funniest scenes were those in which Blandings hires a contractor to dig a water well. They dig down hundreds of meters, but never find water. Yet not far away, a few days later, the basement of his floods! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performances as the pair of Blandings shocked by problems they never imagined and Melvyn Douglas is even better as a lawyer and Blanding's family friend. <br /> <br /> The only warning is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit naive confused that she has no idea how many additional problems she is causing, and there is a black maid (horrors!). So don't watch this movie through the 2003 social goal, and you'll have even more fun. <br /> <br />
