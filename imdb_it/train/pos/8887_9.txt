When I saw the movie, I was really shocked to see what the 60s were like. I know I could be wrong about some things, but it seemed that the 1960s really had an effect on the people of the time. Some people said they would like to go back to the 60s. From what I've seen I would say yes for excitement and no for the outcome. But this is my opinion.
