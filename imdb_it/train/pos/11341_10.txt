This could only be the most nostalgic journey back in time and time until childhood begins a journey to reminiscences back and forth forward and up, back and forth, up and down and all around. The boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion, and even the evil Witchie Poo also through and through. The inspirations of the last days of Lidsville, "The special preview of Brady Kids Saturday morning" Sigmund & the Sea Monsters, and Land of the lost both the new and the old are what this show has filled the gap and The Donny & Marie Show, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka Brady Bunch Hour & Even The Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Perhaps other things between and Beyond the Buck continues to go on and on and even beyond expectations and even unexpected limits. Now as we are updated in March 2006, we know that Jack Wild is gone and so now he makes it even more symbolic for us to become really nostalgic. Including now in August 2006 both when Jack Wild guest is the protagonist of both himself on Sigmund and The Sea Monsters and when on a subsequent episode also HRPuffinstuff does it and to recall all the other nostalgic trips of all the Characters of Syd & Marty Kroft also included The HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club; The Donny and Marie Show; The Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka The Brady Bunch Hour, etc. Sincerely, Stephen "Steve" G.
