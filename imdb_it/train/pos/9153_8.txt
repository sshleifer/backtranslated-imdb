I finally saw this after hearing great things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the requested budget this was a surprisingly competent and well done film. The lack of finances has actually helped this film in many ways, especially considering the plot. Just like The Blair Witch Project, this film was the best to be shot on video rather than on film. Another advantage: considering that most low-cost horror movies (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting, this movie actually has a talented cast (except one or two characters), in particular the two protagonists. The only thing missing in the film was an original storyline. He borrows heavily from better-known films like "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, movies of this nature never cease to be terrifying. Furthermore, the director keeps things interesting for everyone. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have the feeling that it will only be a matter of time before we discover ...
