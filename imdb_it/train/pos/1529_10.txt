Diagnosis Murder is one of the few programs that I watch regularly on TV now. The way in which all the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so different from today's shows that they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode and all the others are pushed to the side. Even the way the sign brain works is so obscure that you never really know what you're thinking, and if you think so, you're wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder has addressed a wide range of topics, not just in cases but in each of the personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> What about being for old people? I am 24 years old!! I don't think I can be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so I can watch them all in order. They seem to do it with many other programs of the same era, so they can hurry up a bit!
