A young and apparently promising graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for the murder of an innocent young woman and is put on death row. Sean Connery plays the "happy go lucky" lawyer that the young man's grandmother tracks down to withdraw and implores him to face the case in the hope of freeing his nephew. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is determined to expose a theory that Connery could dig to try to free the boy that he and the entire police department are swearing to be guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Late Lynne Thigpen are the co-stars of this intense dramatic thriller.
