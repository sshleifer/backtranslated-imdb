This film is one of the most daring black and white films of this period in the early 1930s, before the Hoyts Code was applied. It is the story of a beautiful young woman who moves to New York and makes her way to the top of business using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the beautiful young Lily Powers who really does a good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and makes her way into the business world by sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck does an exceptional performance as a strong woman who uses men as a timed affair, almost no emotion towards them, as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has no love for her head, only power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a little different from the other movies I've seen because there's practically no background music heard. I think it is only because it was like this that people were introduced to experience the sound and the dialogue between the people in the film. The few times the music is listened to is during the beginning, since we are shown how to make our way along the chain. Filming and different scenes were something fantastic! The director of this film has made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was all a separate movie. The ending of this film was not as good as it should have been, but it didn't spoil it at all. Baby Face has had its slow scenes throughout the film, and perhaps some predictable parts such as those who go to bed. But this is an amiable film that can be seen more than once and suggested to some people and friends.
