I saw Soylent Green in 1973 when he was released for the first time and maybe eight more times over the years on T.V. or video. It was always one of my favorite science fiction films and / or Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater of L.A. he had a retrospective of twelve Charlton Heston films. I flew in out of state to see six of the movies over a two-day period. Soylent Green appeared great on the Egyptian big screen with a new perfect print. From his opening editing to the home scene to the fantastic ending the film was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eats a world of dogs with few natural resources left and no understanding of how the world was and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both fantastic. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better in a large 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and the cinematoraphy, the writing, the music used and everything that works on it works. The film is also very powerful in its squalid and very possible vision of the future. Just think of how the world population has grown, the rainforest that has disappeared, the resources exhausted, the greenhouse effect worsened since 1973. I just wonder why this film didn't play in theaters in all these years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputation, people often talk as if Charlton Heston was not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee back to back, I'm convinced he's one of our best actors. Obviously he has made a dozen other great films and for those that keep you in the know what they are. <br /> <br />
