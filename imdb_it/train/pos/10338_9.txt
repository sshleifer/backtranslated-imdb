Norman, are you? It was (it's all in the third hand, so take it with a pinch of salt) adapted to an African American family by a Jewish woman, when she made the transition from the stage and on screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally shot on video, so prints from the theater couldn't be so great. However, the performances of Redd Foxx and others have been pretty good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say to all of you is that the film is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflects the attitudes in the mid-70s on how to find out you have a gay son or daughter in your family. For this reason alone, it is rather interesting, if not a bit "hollywood". You do not believe me? Check the lines on the curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in a couple of areas. There is a scene that divides the sides when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who has escaped with her brother (!) To Ensenada in a trito on Pinto. The telephone conversation across the border is truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine that they used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time the routine was shot. It is a slightly cleaned and much shorter version, I was told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and it shouldn't be lost. People are still stealing jokes from Wayland; the man was really gifted. Enjoy the movie!
