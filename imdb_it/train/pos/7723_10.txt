A number of factors make it easy for me to say that I still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some recitative, obsolete dialogues, etc. <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale of imagination in describing the Krell, a humanoid race originally from the planet, now all dead, which were 1 million years more advanced than the humans on Earth (us), and their technology, in particular the 8,000 cubic meter machine. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. It creates a disturbing, supernatural feeling, unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music. <br /> <br /> Third, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly ever imagined, it is also based on true science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and above all, Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made that tries and, more incredibly, manages to make an honest, intelligent and merciless affirmation logical on the limits or on the roof of human development or any other biological entity), regardless of how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.
