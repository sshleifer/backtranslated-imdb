Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a beautiful teenager with a lively personality and a much admired opera singer voice. This 1937 was his first major film, and proved to be a veritable gold mine for besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE INTELLIGENT GIRLS concern three daughters of a divorced couple who have been rushing to their father for a long time - the faithful mother reveals that she could soon remarry - with the firm intention of weakening her girlfriend who was looking for gold and bring it back to the mother. Although the plot is light, the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a velvety touch. Durbin has a pleasant voice and a captivating personality, and actors such as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer complete the cast. An ultra-light fun for fans of the 1930s movie. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
