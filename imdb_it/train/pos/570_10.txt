Embarrassing, I just saw this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It is a story that any father or brother can relate to ... a brother is a bit wild, the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a bit too emotionless like his older brother, but Pitt is fantastic, and Skerritt is perfectly chosen as a father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The film closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a film format. Unlike most books and films, this measure. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional film.
