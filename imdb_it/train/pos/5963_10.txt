This movie is horrible, but you have to see it for that. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest hunting scene ever. When Eddie turns milk over Tim, he is chased down the corridor. Eddie poses hilariously with hilarious consequences (like a dish that nails a trumpeter, buy the DVD and watch it slow). The best obstacle is an upside-down bucket that an athlete jumps on but proceeds to slide on the ground outside a door. But when it slips it takes speed, challenging physics (mainly friction); yet what is behind the door is supreme. The steepest climb of any school, that this jock proceeds to CLEAR in the air. In reality, he probably would have died of a broken neck. Not only does it escape all the concepts of reality, it makes the most fun noise ever made in that situation. Go and buy this. Trust me, this scene is worth your 6 dollars.
