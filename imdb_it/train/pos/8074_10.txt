Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as everyone else on Earth. Living in Ireland in the 1920s, Gypo and the other Irish are part of a clandestine rebellion against the English oppressive. A rebel, wanted for murder by the British, sneaks into the city. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the Â£ 20 reward turns out to be too tempting. Gypo has his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Right away, Gypo, with the money that burns a hole in his pocket, is their main suspect, but they, who are his friends, don't want to believe it. The plot of The Informer is simple in plot, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It is easily one of John Ford's most emotionally engaging films. What Gypo has done is wrong, but we can certainly understand its motives. We also understand his displeased character, and there is a lot of sympathy for him. Even the script is very full of suspense. It's the kind of suspense we're pretty sure we know how it will all go, so we have to grit our teeth and bring it along. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who starred in many of Ford's films, probably gave his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). Every other interpreter of the film deserves his compliments. In addition to a surprising script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionistic films. I love the dark side of Ford. In his mood, as well as in his themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford movies, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); it is also somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in these respects. 10/10.
