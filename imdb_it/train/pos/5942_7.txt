I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought he had a theatrical appearance and that it was a possibility that Collora could make a good film. This trailer didn't give me the same impression. The plot, or the potential plot, was pretty good, but due to acting and special effects it left me feeling that he would make a good TV movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not a good Superman. In fact, I thought he had made a decent Clark Kent in his brief appearance. Sorry, I don't just think of SuperMan as a buff. The dress Kent wore masked his size. Batman could have the body of a bodybuilder but not Superman. Supes is tonic without a doubt but not in bulk. However, I didn't care about all his poses and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed blatant. Now this may not just be O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to take some credit for poor scripture and direction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the special effects for the flight were cheezy. Superman flies across the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman was flying near the ground, with telephone cables and buildings visible above him. I don't think there were full body shots of Superman flying. Obviously the harness and rigging that supports O'Hearn must have been placed on the lower part of his bust. <br /> <br /> All in all it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to see a movie, if ever done, and I'll definitely look for it on television. The plot, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Lois's attraction for Wayne, Lex and Twoface working together to defeat Superman and the union of the forces between Batman and Superman is a good idea. I'm sure that with a larger budget and approval for a complete film Collora and company, O'Hearn could also offer a decent film. Certainly one better than most comic crap coming out of Hollywood lately.
