In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) as a career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find space between these to adapt to smaller stones, to our small needs. If you act in reverse, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five protagonists of this film are women who have not been able to organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, defines his first feature film Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel and conflictual trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954 -). Everyone is striving to remove the stones that appear insistently in their path or, worse, in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of the Prince Charming and a new possibility in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also plays in "20 Centimetri", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Ottavia".
