If Mulder was looking for his real father here is Darren McGavin, the first X Files, too bad it was just a season that the producers of this show didn't know they had the qualities of a classic in their hands and in 1993 Chris came along Carter with what I call the sequel to the Night Stalker, The X Files. Both will go down because the classics are my opinion The two shows take viewers to a level of experience that comes only once in a while and that should appear in the X Files years after Darren McGavin, as agent Arthur Dales who helps our two heroes favorite, s resolution cases. Paying homage to the man I think so, well done Chris Carter reporting a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if it wasn't for watching X files and that particular show that I would never know about the Night Molester.
