I'm writing this after just watching The Perfect Son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their Father dies, two strange brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from AIDS, they enter a journey of reconciliation that warms the heart. The two protagonists do a magnificent job in creating the gradual warmth and respect that accumulates between them as the film progresses. However, I have a certain concern about the film - while the dying brother behaves badly, he doesn't look at it. A person with 0 T4 cells would look rather sick - it wasn't even a trick to make the actor look sick. A small complaint, but that makes it a little less realistic. Despite that minor complaint, The Perfect Son is a wonderful film and you should have the chance to see it. I'm hoping for a DVD version in the near future!
