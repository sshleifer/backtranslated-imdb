William Powell's final release as Philo Vance takes place in The Kennel Murder Case, in which the murder of a championship show dog leads to two other murders and an attempt by mankind. It's all in understanding how this leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> The murders of Philo Vance of SS Van Dine were very popular at the time and the intelligent Mr. Van Dine found a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest bidder in the studio. This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studies that stage them. If Bill Powell had not become famous with MGM as Nick Charles in the Thin Man series, he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vance. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell entered his little captain terrier in the same race where the killed dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim. As usual, Powell introduces Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose greatest contribution to the proceedings was to use his bulk to knock down the inside of the inner door where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I said I was stuck by the inside and it was a superior story so it was in understanding how. Powell has a lovely group of suspects, as vast as the one normally found in Thin Man's mystery. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, fill their roles well. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually passed it again in the 1930s with James Stephenson in his one release as Philo Vance. It is not a candle for this. <br /> <br /> As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is available on VHS or DVD, always watch this or buy it if you can.
