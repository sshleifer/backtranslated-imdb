Well done and elegant, while in the end it still makes sense this thriller would work better for non-yellow fans to take an interest in the genre of subsequent Silver voices that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For fans of these crazy Italian thrillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and the turns his character takes and what he has put in place. Working with the camera is cool with flashes of graphic violence and strange but appropriate choices and even a good musical score not too much. The less you know the story, the better you make it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing in maintaining this from a great thriller directed by Sergio Martino is that the story does not have that sexual or psychological excess or both elements to put it on top. It is more a routine mystery, the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their virtues and defects. <br /> <br /> The recent version of DVD (2005) is good-looking and certainly the way to watch the film, unless you ever get artistic projections that seem unlikely.
