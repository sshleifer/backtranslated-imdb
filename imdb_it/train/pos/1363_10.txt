A fantastic movie from the 90s! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much money. Posey offers an exceptional performance as a librarian and nocturnal crawler. This is a good light movie for Saturday night before going out. The soundtrack oscillates, the outfits are out of the world, the script is fun and the actors do a great job. The redeeming value: you can do it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I think Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this type of character: young, fabulous and green. (You must search for the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you look at Party Girl, you're destined to have fun. To enjoy!
