I liked this movie. When the guy who had a bank robbery for 40 million dollars in gold dies, his cell mate is used as a "bait" to lead them to the crazy high-tech killer (having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge )). It's an action movie, of a spy type, with comic scenes enough to make it light. It reminded me of the enemy of the state. Plot well done and quite good.
