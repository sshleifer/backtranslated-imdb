I haven't seen much German comedy, but if this movie is something to go to, I'm forced to see more! The simple but effective plot brings two very different people on a journey from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother of two, discovers that her artist husband has a relationship with the wife of a rich lawyer. I will not reveal anything more, but the result is a series of very entertaining events with the perfect ending. My interest in international cinema has grown since I first saw this film. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... don't let the inclusion of young children fool you into thinking it's a family movie) that loves comedy, even those unfamiliar with the language.
