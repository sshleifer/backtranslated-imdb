I liked this movie, it's mainly because I like to see Sean Connery acting and this has the advantage of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne too. The story has a grandmother who seeks Connery's assistance because her grandson is in prison and says he was wrongly convicted. At first it seems that there were some racist aspects of the case, but later it turns out that the case's chief officer was himself black and he seems to have done some pretty nasty things to force a confession to the boy. Well, the boy tries to point to another murderer locked up in the same prison, one who is about to be put to death. He too is a particularly unpleasant person, given that he takes great joy in what he has done, writing the relatives of his victims and trying to convince people to send them. A lot of twists in this with some being somewhat unexpected. I liked the character of Sean Connery trying to make sense of the whole ordeal. The film drove me crazy even in the areas, especially when I found out what happened in the end. You get a great game between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, as all of them shine pretty well in this. In the end this is a good suspense / thriller.
