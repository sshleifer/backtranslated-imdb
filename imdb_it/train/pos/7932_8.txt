When I watch a low budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect that acting is not good (for budgetary reasons), I expect that lighting is not good (for budget reasons), I expect the sound to be not so good (budget again). Stop judging these low-budget films like a big-budget movie !!! I'm a director myself, so I understand the budget constraints for a low-budget film. Stealing places, shots etc ... the list could go on forever. I don't mean that all the acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not yet sold to Carl Washington. He must understand that each line is not important, some are launch lines. I say that if a film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good film. I liked this movie. I gave an 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great work, Quiroz brothers!
