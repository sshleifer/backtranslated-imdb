Shannon Lee, Bruce Lee's daughter, offers high martial arts action with spades in this hilarious Hong Kong film and shows that, like her late brother Brandon, she is a real chip from the old block. There's a high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast-paced movie and the creators of the Bond movies should check it out if they want to rekindle the action quotient of the next adventure 007, since there are many innovative things here with freshness and the second original unit works to reinforce the already high action content of "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEAD". When you watch a fast and funny movie like this you start to wonder how cinema was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created. I sincerely believe that films in general and action films in particular are marking time until the first kung fu films made their debut. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving descendant Shannon did not leave the family name down here. Although there are several enjoyable performances in this film (Michel Wong for one) it is Shannon Lee who you will remember for truly spectacular performances like Mandy, the supreme hitgirl. Well, you could come away whistling his fights!
