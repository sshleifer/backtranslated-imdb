I see a lot of really bad posts from people who wrote in August, even though the film wasn't released in the United States, at least, until mid-September. Perhaps these are unhappy expatriates living in South Korea and having seen him soon. I'm in the United States and I've seen it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-western, but I think we are used to this from many other films. It was not at all difficult to follow. Lead acting was weak, but other people were pretty good. There was also humor. I voted for him at 8 because I enjoyed watching him, and that's what I went for.
