Oh dear we don't like it when our love for superheroes develops a true brain? <br /> <br /> Has something happened to people, they have lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feeling good, love history / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - fun, sexy and real. I laughed out loud at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say that I had a tear in my eyes a couple of times. The cast, the acting and the script are fantastic, I watch many films across the board and I haven't seen one of this genre that has been as successful. Who disagrees, tell me where I can find them! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you should judge him for his merits.
