I saw this film for the first time in 1980 and now in 2006 this film is still one of the best films I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. You will not regret. It is well acted, so real and never a boring moment. The acting is superb and the location makes the film like you're there. From the beginning to the end, this film is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actress does an excellent job portraying the girl who survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon alone. It is incredible that anyone can survive under these conditions. This is why this film is so attractive. The fact that this is a true story makes the film even more interesting and to think that a young girl can survive this experience is overwhelming. I find this film one that I can watch over and over again and one I never get tired of. This is really a compliment because I have hundreds of movies! I would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
