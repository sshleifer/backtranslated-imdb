I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the part phenomenally and with a good heart. She plays a woman who is pushed to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realizes she is alone. <br /> <br /> Then one day, when she is home alone, the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again. Not being about to call the police or take him out, she is forced to spray him in the eye and imprison him in his fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think we need an alarm for the laws of the earth. They are too easy with these criminals. It's time for harsher punishment.
