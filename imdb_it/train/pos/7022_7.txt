LONG LAST!!!!!!!!!!! I waited for the film to come out for almost a year and finally saw it at the SB premiere. I met some actors who were really nice and who were great in the film. I watched the trailer so many times that I didn't know what to expect but I was completely sucked. The movie was really nice to watch and the music was good too. I recommend it to all those who are fans of the ryan donowho, and even the dominique swain was very good. the other actors were good too. I hope you arrive soon on DVD !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first joined Ryan from watching the OC and then saw him in a group of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. It's great in this movie, and all it does is indie. I also like Dominique, but I haven't seen her that much. I hope to see them both soon !!!
