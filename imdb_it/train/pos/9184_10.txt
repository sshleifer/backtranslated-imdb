Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) And it looks a little dated, but both casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to look at other versions! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton It's Edward Rochester ... it's that simple. I don't care that other reviewers say it's too good. Dalton is attractive, of course, but not a nice guy. In fact he has a steep and angular hollow that, in my opinion, is perfectly in tune with the mysterious, very virile Mr. R. And he faces the sad, tortured person of Rochester so sharply. It represents ferocity when the scene requires it, but it also shows the tender, passionate, emotional side of Rochester. (IMO's most recent A & E production suffers from the fact that Ciaran Hinds - who I normally love - seems to smash and bully everywhere. I've read the book many times and never thought that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a snarling beast nonstop.) <br /> <br /> When I reread the novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Mrs. Clarke, to me, looks like Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Small, childish, fairy ... although it is true that the actress does not seem 18, she portrays Jane's attributes so well. While other reviews have stated that his acting is wooden or non-emotional, it must be remembered that the character spent eight years in Lowood trained to keep his emotions and "passionate nature" under control. His main source of inspiration was his childhood friend Helen, who was the image of a submissive submission. Although her true nature was dissimilar, Jane learned to master her anger and appear docile, in line with the school's goals for her charity students who would be 'in service'. Jane becomes a housekeeper in the home of wealthy Mr. Rochester. Certainly * he * will not speak to him as an equal. Even later, when he gave everything he received, he would always remember that his post was well below that of his employer. However, if you read the book - to which this production remains incredibly close - you can clearly see the small struggles that Zelah-as-Jane endures while subjugating her emotions to remain mild and serene. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is right, I think. No, it doesn't look anything like Hollywood (thank God! It's not a kind of Hollywood book), but theirs is a love story that is true, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who has never presumed to have * any * love, her way is a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the casting is exceptional, and I love the fact that almost all the character in the book is present here. So also the rich and poetic original dialogue is a lot. This version is the only one I know to include the beautiful and infamous "gypsy scene" and, in general, presents more humor than the other versions I've seen. In particular, the mutual mockery between the protagonists comes directly from the book and is so delicious! <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first innovative feminists. In the end he accepted love on his own terms and independently and, in the end, as the true peer of Rochester. Simply beautiful!
