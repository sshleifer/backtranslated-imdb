This film revolves around both Japanese culture and the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 (especially in public), so everything that bows instead of hugging even when you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and this too in public! Never less is ballroom dancing (on enough) immensely popular. People who practice ballroom dancing in Japan are seen somewhat like nudists in the west ... many others would like but are not inhibited by culture. A delightful family film, which every amateur dancer would appreciate only for dance sequences. I understand that it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I guess the Japanese are like all of us - they also like being hugged.
