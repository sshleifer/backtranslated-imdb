THE MELTING MAN ... a tragic victim of the space race, the MELTING perished ... never having understood the LONG GONE BY race ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand on the kitchen stove. But instead of shouting something that a normal person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie you made to appear ... is not a normal movie. You have just taken your first step in THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous gore movie of the late 70's with the wonderful makeup effects by Rick Baker. Baker was on the verge of becoming a superstar, and did so at the same time as his famous "alien cellar" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name, and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN did not. <br /> <br /> It might have something to do with the fact that this movie is simply terrible. From the opening credits ("Starring Alex Rebar in the role of THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN" ... that's just what he says!), To the chubby nurse who crosses a glass door, to the fisherman's head that crosses a waterfall and shatters graphically in some rocks, this film offers many, many moments of pure incomprehensibility. "Why did they ... but why did he ... why am ...?" After a while, stop wondering why and look at it as what it is - a very funny piece of junk. <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to Earth in a melting and radioactive condition; he runs away and, with his mind disintegrating like his body, a mad murderous madness begins. The authorities quickly decide that the man who is melting must be stopped, but (probably not wanting to "cause panic") they want to capture him as quietly as possible. So they send a guy with a geiger counter behind him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Storywise, surprisingly little happens during the film. The dissolving wanders to kill people. A doctor looks for him with a geiger counter. Various characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. Eventually the doctor reaches the man who is melting, but he is killed by a security guard for no reason, after explaining that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson". The melting man moves away and eventually dissolves into a large pool of goo. The End. <br /> <br /> It is so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun, despite a fairly negative ending. Presumably, a widescreen DVD version is planned. A very special film.
