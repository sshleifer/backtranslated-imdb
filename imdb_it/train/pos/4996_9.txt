I've seen tons of Hong Kong actors, and this is really top of the line. Action scenes are exciting and kinetic like anything you've ever seen in any action movie. The kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnic mirage, the work of the stunts. The assembly is perfectly balanced, increases tension and compliments the fluid work of the camera. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is filled with some of the best works of the genre, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing missing in this film is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male protagonist, gets closer. This film is full of archetypes rather than characters: the sexy killer, the goofy and his bitchy girlfriend, the bad shouting. That said, Shannon Lee has an exceptional scenic presence; she is fantastic with fights, stunts and weapons. When it's on the screen it's hard to take your eyes off her. She is so good. Why isn't this woman an important star?
