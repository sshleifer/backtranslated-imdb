This was my second time to watch the film (through the French version compared to the first one, which was nicknamed in Italian) and I think it improves the subsequent views. <br /> <br /> A compelling construction if built slowly -up character study that is beautifully filmed and with Parisian settings that are equally impressive. In the long run, it is not Polanski of a high level and I would rate it at number 9 in his filmography, but it is still a sure mix of subtle thrills and, surprisingly, often of a vast comedy. It also features a refined cast, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Even so, I'm a little baffled by the sudden compulsion for Trelkovsky to 'change' in the previous tenant; apart from the owner of the bar in front of the building, where he was given everything that Simone used to do without asking if he wanted something different, there is very little to indicate (as far as I know, anyway) that this is the one that everyone wanted from him! Ok, so he found Simone's objects still in the apartment, but what prompted him to wear his clothes and come up with her (even though he apparently started doing it unconsciously)? Following his nightmare visions in the bathroom, the last section of the film (where Adjani almost disappears) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the landlord and other tenants witness his suicide attempt as if it were a night at the Opera. , a concept that had already been used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! <br /> <br /> So the ending is both predictable and unresolved: just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window?!; I remember that this factor disturbed me even during the first vision, and I am sorry to say that now it is no longer clear! Mind you, the first two thirds of the film are pretty solid, but I hope Polanski was less dependent on obscure points in the plot.
