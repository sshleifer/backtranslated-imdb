Although this film is not a classic anywhere, it is as much fun as I remember it. I saw it about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur" and although it's not as funny as that movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon has achieved with "Arthur".
