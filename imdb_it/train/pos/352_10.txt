I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say that it was the best slasher movie I've seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of 90s horror movies, this film is more worried about being disturbing than being self-deprecating. For those out there who hated "Scream", there is no reference to the "rules of horror" in this film (although the rules of the old slasher movie apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect blend of 80s and 90s horror. You'll get the style, the cinematography and the good acting of the films of the 90s and the madness of the stalking-slasher of an 80s movie. I think the year 2001 will end up giving horror fans the kind of movies they wanted. This is definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a fun character. You can say that she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. I loved it in this movie.
