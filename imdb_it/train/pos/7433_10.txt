My mom took me to see this movie when it was released on Christmas in 1976. I loved it then and I love it now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this, but I think it looks and sounds great! ... And I seem to remember a certain number of women who copied that perverse look at that moment! Moreover, the bathtub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is simply so sexy! The music is also great. This is the groovy 70's Babs at its best!
