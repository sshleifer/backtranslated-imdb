This film is wonderful. Writing, directing and acting are all fantastic. Very witty and intelligent script. Quality performance of the actors, Ally Sheedy is strong, dynamic and delightfully eccentric. Really original and with a warm unpredictable heat. The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production.
