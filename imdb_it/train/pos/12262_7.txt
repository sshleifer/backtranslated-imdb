About thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published an interview with the Belgian artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film reaches Sadoul today when he remembers the interview, while we listen to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and we see some old photos and videos of himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at Herge's request, and we now know that these concerned the separation from his wife, after having had an affair with one of his collaborators (who would become his second wife years later). An interesting thing that the film does not address well is the shift of Tintin's books from the first right-wing and imperialist books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in the lands of the Soviets) to quite anti-imperialist books a few years later (The Blue Lotus). On the whole, I get out of this movie knowing some other things about Herge and seeing it as a little more unlikely than when I come to the theater.
