The first was good and original. I wasn't a bad horror / comedy movie. So I felt that a second one was made and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this movie work is the character of Judd Nelson and the sometimes clever script. A pretty good script for a person who wrote Final Destination movies and the direction went well. Sometimes there are scenes in which it seems that they were shot using a home-made video camera with a grainy appearance. <br /> <br /> Great movie made for TV. It was worth the rent and probably worth buying just to get that nice scary feeling and watch Stanley by Judd Nelson doing what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel, just so you get an idea of ​​how Stanley is and have some history.
