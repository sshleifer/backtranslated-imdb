Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are becoming close to rock stars in the present future, but they still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted are in public folk history, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) will kill Bill & Ted by sending cyborg look-like to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent to the present past and actually kill the real Bill & Ted. Now, both boys are spirits and have to go through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) he made an intelligent sequel with extraordinary visual effects. Much more fun and fun than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a good Widescreen anamorphic transfer (1.85: 1) and a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound. DVD has the theatrical trailer and a fun featurette behind the scenes. This sequel was a box office success like the original but it is also (believe it or not) one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin resumes his role from the original briefly. Pam Grier also appears in a role a little. It's a fantastic and fun comedy. (**** / *****).
