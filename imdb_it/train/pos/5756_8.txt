Anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the tangle of Elk Hills. The elders of the city have named Aaron, a Vietnam veteran, a tough and engaging veteran (a wonderfully robust and endearing performance of Kris Kristofferson) and some of his fellow veterinarians to clean up the place. The plan becomes acrid when Aaron and his cruel friends decide to take control of Elk Hills after getting rid of all the bad elements. It's up to brother Ben, Aaron's good brother (played amicably by Jan-Michael Vincent) to stop him before things get out of hand. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage lashes a deliciously amoral, cynical and wicked subversive Amazon, exploiting the contemporary winner of the West: skillfully creates a gritty tone with no frills, keeps pace and tireless for everything, and stages abundant action scenes with remarkable muscular disharmony (the explosive explosive climax is particularly strong and moving). The first-class cast of familiar B-feature faces is an important asset: Victoria Principal as Ben's sweet girlfriend Linda, fabulous Bernadette Peters as flaky singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as reckless mayor David Doyle as a slimy president, Andrew Stevens in the role of an affable station attendant, John Carpenter regularly interprets Charles Cyphers as one of the "Nam veterinarians", Anthony Carbone as a blatant casino manager, John Steadman as the old restaurant owner , Paul Gleason cursed shakedown and Dick Miller as a talented pianist. Moral: don't hire other people to do your dirty work. The refined cinematography of William Cronjager, the lively and harmonious bluegrass score of Gerald Fried, and the abundant violent violence further contribute to the general trash fun of this small unjustly neglected doozy.
