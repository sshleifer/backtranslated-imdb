Yes, it looks like Keaton really enjoyed making this movie. With a leap in his stride in his striped suits, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young hood who does only to pay for his mother's expensive medical expenses and to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. Nobody even knows Johnny Kelly It's Johnny Dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and doesn't like Johnny a little (and I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing / dancing routine while Johnny has fun. I love the part when I'm in the ever-running car! The policeman who is "calling all the cars" is the skipper of Gilligan's Island! See this for the laughter of the 1930s gangsters! The gags in this movie are hilarious but you have to take them or you'll miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
