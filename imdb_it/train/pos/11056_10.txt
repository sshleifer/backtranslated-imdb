Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed "The Baron" with this, a fantasy series on three superhuman spies who anticipated "The Six Million Dollar Man". It was one of my favorites when I was a young man, and I enjoy watching it again. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the luscious Alexandra Bastedo pouted through her role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a tremendous Tremayne. The best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while "The Interrogation" by Spooner was compared to "The Prisoner". I'm sorry that there has never been a second series; the concept had so much life in it. Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron's affections? What if Tremayne knew about the powers of the champions? Do the samples have other skills than the ones we've seen? Unfortunately we never found out.
