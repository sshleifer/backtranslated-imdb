There are other reviews here so I don't need to say how good or what it is ... My point is: I heard about this movie years ago, before it was shown. I can't even remember how, I just know it was through the internet. The distributors went down before it hit! For months I motorized and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to purchase this film and the only area highlighted is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista Babelfish to translate. I know it's in PAL format and they changed the text on the screen in German and there's a little bit of storytelling in the beginning that was also nicknamed in German, but as hilarious and engaging as this movie, it really makes it more fun! If you want to see this movie and have a place nearby that does conversions, it's worth it! It costs about twenty dollars or so to get to the United States from Germany. Trust me, it might seem like a lot to spend on a movie, but if you like bizarre b-flicks you will blow your money left and right and get conversions for your friends!
