My 10/10 score is simply for the fun factor and assumes that you have decided that you liked "Slaughter High" even before watching it. Yes, it's the typical revenge-years-after-a-dirty-joke of the story, but how can you not appreciate some of the things that pull here ?! I couldn't have predicted the bathtub scene in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie doesn't offer anything new. Well, it doesn't pretend to do it. It's the kind of film that the "Scream" characters probably saw, and contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things? Obviously, it has a sort of reactionary undertone, as people are punished for doing what the 1960s defended. But anyway, you have to love this stuff! So with apologies to Don McLean, this jester didn't sing for the king and queen!
