This is the best Jackie Chan movie, and my favorite. After the disappointing U.S realized "The Protector" directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and hit it in Hong Kong. This is probably also the most violent film by Jackies, with the audience raging against the breathtaking acrobatics. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and her crew really did their best in combat design. The bones were broken and the blood spilled during the making of this film, as you'll see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple affair of guards and thieves, nothing special, after all it was written around the action. I must say that the English version has some dubious dubbing, but it should not discourage you too much. <br /> <br /> So, let the boys run around, open the beers and have fun. By the way, the film was nicknamed "Glass Story" by the stunt staff. Why? I'll let you find out for yourself !!
