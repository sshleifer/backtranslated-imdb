I think the deal with this film is that it has about 2 minutes of really fun moments and makes a great trailer and a lot of people came in with the expectations from the trailer and this time the movie is not up to the trailer. He's a little slower and he drags himself a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and I think I see from the comments people who have a love / hate relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look at this film for what it is and not for what it might have considered the talent of the cast, I think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she is so dizzy and carefree that she is placed between the conformity of all the others, she lights up and the whole audience falls in love with her together with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled collaborators, his elegant mother-in-law, his little brother friend Jim and his future girlfriend all do a great job of adapting to the stereotypes of conformity and boredom that make Stiles stand out first place. <br /> <br /> Lee doesn't live up to his costar, I don't think so, but you might see it as something more difficult to live with. Perhaps this is a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite a bit of slowness and some jokes that don't look as funny as the writer was, is still pretty funny and I found a smart movie. The issues of compliance and "taking the safe road" seemed skillfully aligned on different levels. For example, there was all the reason for imagining scenarios, but he would never have acted on them until the last scene, or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, or simply of all that selma blair and Julia Stiles' characters have said and echoed those themes of a person who is the safe choice and a risky choice. <br /> <br /> The other positive thing about the film is that it was a kind of black comedy in which Jason Lee must continue to make his way through the film and who through a stupid fortune (example: the pharmacy boy proves to be a good cook) and some skill on his part can get away with most of it. > <br /> Although it wasn't as fun as I expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent, but overall it's still a good movie.
