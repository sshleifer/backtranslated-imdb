I saw this film in the theater and I was deeply impressed. Then again, when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the silly, arrogant, Hollywood bitch she is today. However, this film really struck me as one of the crudest, most realistic and beautiful friendship films. How far would you really go for your best friend? In the end I was moved to tears, and I still tear myself up when I look at it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater I called my best friend and sobbed as much as I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girl. However be ready for the almost certain conversation in which she turns to you and asks you if you would do something like that for her ....
