Entertaining the vehicle Jim Belushi, a modern short-haired version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel that allows Belush to see what life would have been like if he had "done great things". Jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast; looks like a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar contender but good warm fun.
