The old horror movies are interesting, there are lots of screams, lots of screams and lots of humor to follow. "The Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who tries to be a hero in his city. Going out for a date with his girlfriend is pretty typical for all the guys. But when the old man finds the same falling object from the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve helps him in the best possible way. When it's up to the teen, this movie really does provide it. I know that most teenagers have had their problems when they behave, when danger comes, they have to learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When adults in the city end up learning the way "The Blob" is going crazy, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them. The smelly Juggernaut was pretty nice during the day, and I think it was JELL-O! When everyone comes in to stop the threat, the city is safe again, thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like Jello, TOUGH! 5 STAR EVALUATION
