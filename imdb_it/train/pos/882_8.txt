I chose this on a whim from the library, and I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of tight and expressive photographic works, an equally narrow screenplay and two superb actors come together to make a very beautiful film. Not for the brain of a reptile multiplex, but rather for the real cinema aficionado. If Hollywood ever has its hands dirty on it, I'm sure it will ruin it. A choice of treatment all around. More posters here have more than widely sung his praises, so I don't need to worry about duplicating their numbers; follow their advice, and mine, and don't lose this gem. Call it how you like it; I call it two hours of well spent entertainment. Read my lips: don't miss it.
