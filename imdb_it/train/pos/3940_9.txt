This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high-profile admirers. Ironically, I just discovered it through the recent set of 2 Criterion discs, after losing it a couple of original language screenings on Italian TV many years ago and again on TV while I was in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The film marked the first of nine Ford collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also an example par excellence of Ford's typical American vein. A wonderfully done and pictorially rather poetic piece of work, the court sequences (and the final revelation) in his second half are still in the balance, apart from the fact that Donald Meek, a prominent actor, is a memorable and muscular actor. <br /> <br /> Fonda is, of course, perfectly the interpreter of a shy lawyer, inexperienced but rigorous and humanist, destined to become president; Fonda would continue to portray other fake politicians in films - in particular THE BEST MAN (1964) by Sidney Lumet's Franklin J. Schaffner and FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising now to know that he was reluctant to accept the role at the time of Lincoln because, in his opinion, it was "like playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Ford had previously faced Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a superb but perhaps little-known gem that, fortunately, has just been released as a DVD edition special from the real stand-in of Criterion of the United Kingdom, the label "Masters Of Cinema" by Eureka. Furthermore, I also have two other Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection that I have yet to watch and, incidentally, both have been directed by DW Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - e, I have not just received a series of films that I have never seen before, I would have gladly given a spin based on my highly satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
