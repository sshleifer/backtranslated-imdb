I found Gray Garden's a compelling film, an incredibly intimate look too eccentric <br /> that basically has the right idea: to forget about society and live in a squalid house without heating and a huge <br /> < br /> brood of cats and raccoons, which rather pursues its own interests <br /> <br />, while chatting to the camera. <br /> <br /> Edie and Little Edie are the two crazy ones that Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> have chosen to document. They look like characters from a Fellini film, only a foreigner, if that makes sense. Old Edie is almost completely bedridden, a pile of papers, dirty clothes and dishes growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She dines for the house, always with a hat similar to a babyshka around her head, completely covering her hair. We will never see her hair throughout the film, nor will we ever have a clue <br /> <br /> that she still has a lot. At the age of fifty-eight, however, she is still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In Gray Gardens, we have the feeling that both of these women <br /> lives have become much less than they once were. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of the two. While her mother, in her previous years, got married, made a family, lived luxuriously and even made recordings (the scene where, at 77, she sings) br /> <br /> along with a recording of "Tea for Two" that he made decades ago is <br /> <br /> one of the best scenes in the film), Edie left his promising career as a <br /> model to take care of his sick mother. At the age of 58 he still wanted to find his prince charming. If ever Little Edie is still a child, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame, and domestic and romantic happiness <br /> <br />, which have yet to be met. <Br /> <br /> The highlights of the film include the opening moments, where Little <br /> Edie explains her dress to the camera, the "tea for two" sequence, <br /> <br /> the birthday party, the climate discussion, the food delivery scene and the attic scene. Everything is unbelievably <br /> blunt and unpretentious. And it's made even more invigorating <br /> <br /> since it's all true. <br /> <br /> I suggest to see the Gray Gardens with Kenneth <br /> <br /> short Anger Puce Moment. The Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but it is <br /> <br /> which is worth every penny.
