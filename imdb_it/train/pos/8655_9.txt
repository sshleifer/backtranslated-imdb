"Kalifornia" is one of my favorite movies of all time and could easily be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very elegant surface, but behind it there are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifying violence they inflict on others. One of the most important aspects of the film is his performances, Brad Pitt is as extraordinarily beautiful as Early's psychopathic trailer-trash. Pitt plays his terrifying character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is just as good at playing her naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heartbreaking. "Kalifornia" has a very simple plot, which proceeds slowly and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into a harrowing series of murders, while Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, and everything rises to a powerhouse climax that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that should really be seen for its intense gaze on how a human being can be monstrous, and not just for his violence and his blood.
