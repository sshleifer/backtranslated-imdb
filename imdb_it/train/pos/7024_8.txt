I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked there, so I thought I'd check it out. I thought it was a really nice movie and I can't wait to go watch it again. the actors were really good and I loved all the music! there wasn't much to talk about in the film, which at first seemed a bit strange to me, but once I got there, I thought the story and acting were really exciting and meaningful and I thought it left a lot to the imagination . I want to see the movie again because there was so much to do that I forgot a lot of little things, but I know I left the theater thinking about the movie. it was shot beautifully and everything was really unique.
