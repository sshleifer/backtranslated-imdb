I sit in films like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about cinema for hours. The admiration that this film caused me goes beyond my limits of explanation, because I look at the scenes of the film and I look for ideas and innovations of dialogue in my thoughts that could emerge from something bigger than the mind of Damian Szifron. <br /> <br /> Looking at the environment, so without compromise, so simple, I'm thinking; this man is a genius. No wonder he has created what is probably the best TV show in Argentina ever seen, and then a first film full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet reached. "El fondo del mar" is the name and, awakened (some years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. <br /> <br /> Starting from his daily journey in real life, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never could in "El Bonaerense"; the life of the Federal Police Department. Trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not in the places he saw. Yes, there was a detailed training and lots of criminal situations, but Szifron in "in there", is more like a police story, like the ones we know and love, with mysteries and electrifying music. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of humanity in his writing, and he shows us his inquiry through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many great actors in the film, but these two actors are the ones that the film cannot do without. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who has just discovered that his wife is cheating on him; and must work on a case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist who is assigned the detective's treatment. He wants to take care of him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time frame and suggests to join Díaz in his routine: "It's nothing, the usual things, no problem". But it's bigger than that, and will explain a part of the doctor's personality that he didn't know. <br /> <br /> The relationship developed between the two derivations cannot be explained unless it is observed, because it considers such complexity that shows how talented some men like Szifron are, who are trying today to leave a signature in our history. Reaching points of incredible spontaneity, during a situation of high pressure, Díaz tells Silverstein: "How can we continue our treatment?", And Silverstein replies: "No, I'm not your doctor, call me to dinner, I'm your friend ": we laugh because we can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> And we can't help but laugh when Díaz crashes into a car on the street and doesn't give importance to it, or when it breaks all the red lights in the street, or when it smokes pot in its patrol of the police and Silverstein cannot believe it (but then he also smokes because he is screwed); or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with Díaz robbers. The magic of Diego Peretti is what we receive there. He, a psychiatrist himself, gives a piano performance "Locas de amor", but impresses with his entire range. Luis Luque on the other hand, is back on track with a high-level representation that reminds us of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> There is a passion I have for this, and as I said, I could write about it for hours, but unfortunately that's not how it works and I have to be precise and synthesized. Although I have to watch many of the old movies and study them, I can assure myself that "Tiempo de valientes" is the comedy that Argentina was waiting for and has never had until now.
