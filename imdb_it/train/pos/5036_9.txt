Bill Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark and the fame of Terminator, surprises me with his debut as a director for Frailty. It affects all cylinders, but there is implausibility towards the end involving the FBI agent (Powers Booth) who deduces a point from this otherwise disturbing and challenging thriller. Apart from that, this film was fine. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays dad. He never gave a name, but it is not a weak point in the film. It strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see it as a sort of symbol of some kind. One day he has a vision that says he was sent by god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt Oleary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) must kill the demons and kill them. Demons look like normal people who kill, and this causes the viewer to wonder if Dad has just lost his head or is actually doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points that add confusion and give the film more suspense . <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who has now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and is talking to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and rightly so. After all, it's not every day that someone comes into your office to tell you that he knows who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton presents beautifully, keeping us guessing without losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young actors and Paxton work great together, it seems like a normal family, even though they are all involved in the murder. As I said, there is the implausibility that concerns the character of Powers Booth, but in reality it is not a great thing. This was an extremely well made film that involves faith and family.
