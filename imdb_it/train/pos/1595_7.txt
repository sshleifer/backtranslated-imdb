While I would say I like the show, I was expecting something completely different from when I first saw "What I like about you" I expected to find something along the lines of "All That" (I'm not sure it's happening anymore) but I have to say that I like the show and even if I don't classify it as an innovative show, it is very fascinating and I also like the harmony between the characters (including the supporting cast) <br /> <Br /> I would definitely say that it's nice to see Wesley Jonathan on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy. I also saw the woman who plays Valerie's friend in Popular and while I think it was a show okay, I don't really like her character on this show because it's not just my cup of tea, but it rounds it up pretty well
