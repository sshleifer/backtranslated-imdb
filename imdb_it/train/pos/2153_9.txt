This film was fascinating. An accountant wants more from life than approved formal success. What makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it's not about becoming "Big" but simply finding a way to express yourself. The great triumph in the end is not the winning of a competition, not the discovery of a completely new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to achieve the other parts of your life. No one is discovering his passion, they are finding their peaceful soul. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes subtle oppression and the "secret life" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the common man.
