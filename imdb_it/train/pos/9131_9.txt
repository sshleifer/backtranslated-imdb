"I just wanted to see you laugh in the purple rain." This is an excellent film. It should be re-evaluated in PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first film is the biggest. Follow-up sucked. But I haven't seen for years so here's what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) must juggle the victory for the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keep her band together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in her family. But his rival band (The Time as themselves) is ruining his life. As Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and if you love it, buy it.
