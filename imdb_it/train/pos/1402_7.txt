Contains spoiler <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest film that Paul Verhoeven, director of such great films as "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" has ever made. <br /> <br /> Probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with an absolutely mediocre script, and did the best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this film is pretty good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in the second part, if it had degenerated into a standard slasher movie or perhaps a bad "Alien" clone. The ending is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon continues to come back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is rather superficial, indeed: the subject of invisibility is never completely studied. <br /> <br /> But all in all, Verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 stars on ****
