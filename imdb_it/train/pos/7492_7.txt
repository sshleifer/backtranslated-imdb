Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie delivers the goods. It seems that a vampire is free in a small German town that drains its victims of their blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his first roles, is skeptical believing that a mad killer is not going crazy. The only one who believes in him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), the girlfriend of the inspector and laboratory assistant of dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), who although apparently an eminent scientist gets along with the vampire theory. Citizens suspect the weird Herman Gleib, played with the usual frenzy of Dwight Frye who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The film contains some humor that helps alleviate the intensity of all the murders committed. A fun part has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), the aunt of Ruth Bertin, who thinks the strange Herman did not become a bat but a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye are a good team of comedies. <br /> <br /> This budget film introduces elements from the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with dr. Niemann using the power of the suggestion to do a sleepwalker orders, from "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" since the murders are believed by all but the inspector and his girlfriend be the work of a bloodsucker. These elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Strayer with a small comedy that is staged. The mixture works. The restored version I saw used coloring to increase the spectral atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
