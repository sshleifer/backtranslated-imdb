I really enjoyed the first episode and I look forward to hearing more. A little soft on the crime front (it's almost an afterthought and not terribly full of suspense or carnage) but I thought the romantic corner was wonderfully charming. They are looking for sure again! <br /> <br /> I hope they will have a more important role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and have been a little underutilized this time. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched, I think) is very sweet and bubbly and looks very pretty and sweet instead of stupid and annoying which is very pretty. <br /> <br /> Take a look.
