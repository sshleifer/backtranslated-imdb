This film strikes me as one of the most successful attempts to find plausible answers to some of the annoying questions that have arisen in recent studies of the "Passion" accounts (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What prompted Judah if money was not the problem? What could have led the Sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day? Why was it Pilate's waffle?) It is a film for the serious and thinking Christian: fans of "The Passion of Christ "will undoubtedly be disappointed by the lack of bloody spectacle and characterization of the arch. As for myself, I find the painted portrait here - of the will of ordinary people to sacrifice their common decency so joyfully when their own self-interest is at stake - much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The disinterested person, "just doing my job", looks at the face of the man driving the first nail in the wrist of Christ is chilling like any moment in the film.) The film does not claim "authenticity", but the settings and customs invariably they feel more "just" than many other more acclaimed efforts. It is a slow film but, if you accept its self-imposed limits (it is, after all, "Death" - not Life - "of Christ"), after all a very gratifying one.
