Still Crazy has been compared to Spinal Tap since both are comedies on R & R wash-up groups. In reality, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is written and performed much better, while the Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the first 10 minutes in an amusing way to Beavis and Butthead in comparison. Still Crazy is formulated but the sympathy of the characters and the unexpected quality of some musical numbers have managed to compensate for the a priori predictability of the film. People who expect an attempt at saturation by Spinal Tap will be disappointed by the film's carefree nature, but I would make a playful self-deprecating Still Crazy joke about a pompous but failed blow to the satire that is Spinal Tap.
