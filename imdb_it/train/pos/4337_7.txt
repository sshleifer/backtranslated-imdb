I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason. Perhaps this is his idea of ​​an "adult" movie, a lot of bad words with the humor of the bathroom? I thought better of him and think less of him for this film. <br /> <br /> The acting of Falk, some moments of humor and some important themes are the ones that made me get such a high score. > <br /> This could be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh at their people and their weaknesses. But the lack of consideration for the families of the public seriously damages what could have been a family film, but fails. It is certainly not worth spending money, although it might be worthwhile to watch a watch for free on television.
