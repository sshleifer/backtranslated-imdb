Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. He has an incredible skill for accents and shows an incredible ability in this film. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. She was also interpreted in a realistic way. He was irritable, upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their relentless witch hunt. Initially I didn't expect much from the film, but I really got interested, and the film is based on a real person and on real events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam Neill was also exceptional; this is the best work I've seen from him, and I really enjoyed it in other films (The Piano, for example). I gave the film a 7, but if I could only evaluate acting, I'd give a 9.5 and a perfect 10 for Streep.
