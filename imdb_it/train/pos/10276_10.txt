The opening of the film with a Bach Toccata is a phonetic suggestion of what must take place in this intense drama. All of Bach's compositional devices perfected to keep his listener (and artist) intrigued and amused apply to this film. There is no mutual tenderness between the two protagonists and the female protagonist in the final scene that I think is justified in declaring that she was raped even if her executioner feels warned that he was a cad. Mamet irresistibly explores the emotional abyss and the differences between the sexes, but I feel that he has no idea how they compliment each other given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet had ever developed a healthy humorous interpretation of the interaction between the sexes, I wonder how this work would end? How it exists is very sad and petty.
