In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a coffee shop in any of the elementary schools (1961), so I drove my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the best thing! I would draw pictures hidden on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning some wonderful cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor got the hidden final game. I even got the home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so little. I liked the music and the hidden images - the only one I could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream. <br /> <br /> The really good memories are related to the Camouflage.
