In the areas where this beautiful film overlap, they are light years preceding the 2004 Innocence, which gave the impression of a bleary eye and of panting girls with heavy breathing. Here the effect is much more realistic and really enters the heads of the three protagonists as they feel their way through an adolescence full of pitfalls. The three main ones, all unknown to me, offer very safe performances, the kind, in fact, that can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films, so I would not be too surprised if they are not listened to anymore would be nice if this could get away from the Houses of Art and the Multiplexes where there is only an external possibility of "talking" to the bubblegum crowd to which it is not addressed.
