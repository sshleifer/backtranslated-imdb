This is a truly magnificent and heartbreaking film !!!! The locations of Ripstein are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinarily García Márquez, no doubt about it. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes offer us exceptional performances like the colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You must see it !!!
