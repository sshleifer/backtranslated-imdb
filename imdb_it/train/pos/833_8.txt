First let me tell you that the director has a wonderful use of the titles in his shots. I really liked them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is rather lackluster. Brosnan blends into this character so well, that it's really hard to remember that this is the same guy who played a bond. He also shows his range and depth as an actor. It's a bit of an independent film and it was really cool to watch, especially with all the mainstream movies that flood the movies this time of year. I found the characters well made. The blow in the middle that I felt was particularly good. I also liked how the characters are being realized in a realistic way. So many times we have in the film these caricatures of people who are not really characters but simple stereotypes ... I like the different approaches that this film requires. I think to the side when I think of this film, but I think this is more watchable and a better film overall ...
