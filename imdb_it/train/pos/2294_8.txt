... Hawk Heaven for lovers of French cinema and by extension of Screen's French actors / actresses. In the worst case it is an indulgence, the actors make a mockery of other actors, question the validity of acting as a profession, etc., While at best it is a glorious celebration / transmission of some of the best actors currently in activity. From a simple premise: Jean-Pierre Marielle's request for water to be ignored in a restaurant - Blier turns in all directions and allows the cream of the French cinema to flaunt before the camera even makes a nod to those who are no longer around (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura) including the director's father, Bernard, one of the great supporters of French cinema, from which he unleashed a heavenly phone call at the end of the film. Discursive and verbose, yes, guilty as accused but also something of a guilty pleasure.
