I don't know what the previous review was looking at, but I guess it's the reviews, the personal taste. Lost in this film was the depth, a very profound film, many levels of emotion, which influence. The undercurrents of love held back due to submission to social beliefs, the taboos of time and class, racial relations not being in an excellent state of equality, guilt, desire, hatred, confusion, very dark emotionally I thought , under the skin, which you have to submit to the film, a fluid film, not slow as mentioned before, let yourself go to the flow of the film, the emotions will show themselves, the characters reveal their flaws, their ugly interiors, excellent and in reality very cruel!
