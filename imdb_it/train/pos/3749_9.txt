I laughed a lot while watching him. It's a fun short film with a fun musical act and lots of extravagance. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the stylization of humor. The dialogue is fun and often unexpected, and from the first to the end everything seems to flow wonderfully. There's Max, who has apparently led a horrible life. And there's Edward, who isn't sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's mad boss. Tom has a short but memorable role. Highly recommended for those who love silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all of Jason's cartoons and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.
