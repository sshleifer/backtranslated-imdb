When I think of this film, all the adjectives that come to my mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, that's how I think this film should be judged in terms of. Observe the rich golden tones that surround the young concubine asleep in front of the fireplace, or the suffocating Turkish bath, and let it inundate your senses with impressions of spices, rough fabrics, smooth leather, perfumed oils, flickering flames, rustling of satin. Don't just watch, listen, be absorbed, be hypnotized by the humming voice of the narrator.
