"Shall We Dance?", A short film from Japan, tells of a tiring accountant and a family man attracted by a beautiful woman he sees from the train during his daily commute. What he finds in the studio are the dance lessons and, above all, himself. Fun, moving and absolutely fascinating, "SWD" is an award-winning film that is worth a look at the most mature viewers. (B)
