Incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is a samurai action movie inspired by anime and Hong Kong with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great acting work done by Daisuke Ryu), a killer-become-bhonist monk Benkei. Benkei has vowed never to kill again, but continues to take the sword to fight what he thinks is an invasion of demons ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a difficult film to evaluate. Visual images are incredibly elaborate and beautiful, but they use too many tricks (cameras and high-speed, expressionistic shots, bleeding colors, digital effects etc.), so the end result is quite tiring. That said, the beginning and end of the film are both elegant and powerful. If only director Sogo Ishii was wise enough not to overdo his baggage. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a film with such an anti-violent message, Gojoe wastes too much energy and time on the screen to represent the endless battle scenes. Furthermore, the way violence is shown is always on the verge of being self-indulgent; in fact, a shower of blood against the night sky seems to be one of the images of the film's signature. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to also show the ugly and tragic side of violence. However, it seems that Ishii is not sure if he is making a traditional action film or a profoundly moral allegory. The public cannot be sure of this until the end of the film. The powerful (though cynical) ending is what saves Gojoe; clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a gore-fest.
