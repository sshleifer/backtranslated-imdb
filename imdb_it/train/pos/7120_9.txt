Most of the war films made in the United States during World War II were very funny to watch but suffered serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for the value of propaganda to increase the spirits at home than anything . I'm not beating these films because many of them are still very watchable. However, because they often lack realism, he is prevented from truly making great films. A perfect example was the John Garfield Air Force movie - in which a B-17 almost alone takes half the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome start - scoring high to portray a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story because it seemed too unlikely to be true. However, after further research I discovered that he was actually quite faithful to the extraordinary story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is a case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
