"Panic" is a kind of dramatic comedy with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the lead roles. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people for a living. But for the moment he is facing a depression and that is why he is seeing a therapist. That's where he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He is also facing another problem: he wants to leave the family business (the murders), but now he doesn't know how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a boy during his mid-life crisis, facing normal problems: falling in love with a pretty girl and all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Quite good acting performances by the cast. Macy's is as good as the depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this and it was a good movie, but it didn't deliver completely. The story was rather flat and clich√© .. <br /> <br /> 7/10
