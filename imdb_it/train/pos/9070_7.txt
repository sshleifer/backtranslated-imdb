It started off slow after an excellent animated introduction, as the director had a lot of characters and a school environment to develop. Once the bet has begun, however, the film takes the pace as it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7.00pm. We had a good opportunity on our way home to discuss some things with our son: bullies, helping others, dealing with the subject when you don't want to do something. <br /> <br /> The special note is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director secretly sees her unexpectedly and when she is on the screen she is captivating. It's one of those faces of "Hey, you look familiar," and then I remembered that it was the little girl Pepsi had seen about 8 years ago. He was also in "Paulie", that parrot movie trying to find his way home. <br /> <br /> Ms. Eisenberg made many television and film appearances in '99 -00, but then not much was seen for the next few years. She is now 14 and growing up to be a beautiful woman. His smile really warms the screen. If he can get some better roles, he could have a career (or better?) Better than that of Haley Joel Osment, another actor with three names, but I hope without some of the problems Osment has had lately. <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8-year-old son, who has just finished reading the story, the film does not seem to follow the book very well, but it was still fun. The film's ending seemed like a great show for some sequels (How to Eat Boiled Slugs? Escargot Kid's Style?), Which may not be a bad thing. It was nice to bring the family into a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of the film was the respect / fear aroused by the principal Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Nowadays films tend to show figures of adult authorities as buffoons. While he has a funny scene in particular, he ruled the school with a steady hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin work a bit.
