It happened to me on this film by mistake and I really enjoyed it. The character of Timothy Busfield is without ransom, and at one point, Busfield and star Meloni observe women as they pass ... The way Meloni plays the procession is different from that of Busfield. Janel Maloney is fantastic ... She looks a lot like Tea Leone, but the main difference here is that Janel can actually act. Some very nice things in this movie and deserve your attention when it's on cable.
