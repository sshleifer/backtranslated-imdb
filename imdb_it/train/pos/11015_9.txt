This film is directed by Renny Harlin, the Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse in the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to run actionmovie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. The snowy mountain is a great place for action movies and who is the best at directing movies where snow, ice, cold and bad weather are over. The action is good! The music in the film is spectacular. The villain is John Litghow, other stars Michael Rooker (The portrait of the serial killer), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It is positioned in a beautiful place and is a very exciting film. Overall good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: special collectors' edition, with extra vouchers. Comig soon in Finland directly to the video.
