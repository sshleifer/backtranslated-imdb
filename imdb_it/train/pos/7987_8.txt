Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic story of revenge, and what better cause of revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent child. <br /> <br /> The authors have done an excellent job in this film on building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer can understand and really feel the impulse that Creasy has had to save Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a choir boy trying to save Pita through the "appropriate" channels, but instead used torture tactics and street techniques. Some may say, "Torture is wrong regardless" and you may be right, but when you see the pain Creasy goes through due to the loss of Pita and the sheer passion he has to get her back, you can't help but be on the side with Creasy and pull it to be even more ruthless. There would have been no progress if Creasy had used diplomacy to treat the various criminals and evil criminals and he knew it. <br /> <br /> Creasy's mission ended with Pita returning to his mother and Dying Creasy in the bad boys' vehicle. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, rather it improved it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back. His death was noble in fact. <br /> <br /> Denzel has an excellent job as writers. This film deserves good marks because it was definitely a good movie.
