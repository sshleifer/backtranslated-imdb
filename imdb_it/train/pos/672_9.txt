This film has a constant and disturbing rhythm supported by exceptional acting (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, the music fully establishes the mood and helps maintain a restless, cautious and gloomy tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story has improved by using the aborigines, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to provide a tale of fantasy that is disturbing. <br /> <br /> Although unrelated to history and genre, this has kept the same feeling inside me as "Lathe of Heaven" by Ursula Le Guin (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember, "hacking and slicing" does not make a film a horror film, it is the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests in all of us.
