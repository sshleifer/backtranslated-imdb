Most of the feedback I've heard about Meatball Machine has been pretty mixed. A couple even say they think "sucked". Well, to those people I say, take a little imagination f @ ckin and go f @ ck yourself. This was a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug that attacks and somehow turns its guests into these dead caps called Necroborgs. Eventually we learn that these mechanical errors also attack a small parasite on you, which is therefore able to control your actions due to the hot wiring of the nervous system. Unfortunately for two young adults alone in search of love, it happens to interbreed with the mechanical insect, and before you know it the transformations are taking place and the blood is splashed. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Perhaps a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why are the Necroborgs fighting each other? Do the two desperate singles manage to express their feelings for each other and do bad things? Just a way to find out. <br /> <br /> Entering the Meatball Machine I was a little cautious because of the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a great surprise. Some unanswered questions, some medium acting sometimes and a somewhat confusing ending are the only weaknesses I can think of. From the feeling of the soul, to the parasites that become small characters and also to the feeling of reduced budget, this film hits the right buoy much more than what is missing. With an ever-changing story that's interesting enough to keep asking questions combined with the fantastic make-up and blood splatter effects, this is a huge fan of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans. 8 out of 10
