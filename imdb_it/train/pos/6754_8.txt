The director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney stars in this rough and roaring noir film: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, intelligent dialogues and a nice look with great camera movements and dark and gritty lighting. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark Dixon, partly mafia and partly police officer, who has a reputation for being too physically harsh with criminals. After a case sees Dixon looking for suspicion and answers, he is much more involved than he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is formidable in his role: tough and angular, Dixon of Andrews is ready to silence all four heels if they go bad. It's the perfect anti-hero of the film noir - it's not always very nice, but we still do it. Gene Tierney does a solid job in his role, as much as he is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. There may not be too many things for the role of Tierney, but it will surely go far beyond what others could do with the role, sending all members of the public around with his gentle smile, gentle manner and shining in his eyes. The supporting cast is not so bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, intervenes and offers a good support performance like Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, but it is a great noir film full of great characters, stories and images.
