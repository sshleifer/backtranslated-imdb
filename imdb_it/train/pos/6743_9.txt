Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never recorded for me. Often stolid, taciturn, plays the same kind of roles and looks a little like the underestimated Glenn Ford, he is an actor who requires an effort to really appreciate it; but once you hit the right movie ... <br /> <br /> And that's it. The moody appearance of Preminger in the belly of New York is dirty and dreary almost like any 50s noir, and Andrews is in his element of too tough policeman Mark Dixon who doesn't know how to play to go on: he hates criminals too to always play according to the rules. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally kills the witness of a murder involving an illegal shit game created by a mobster that Dixon hates for personal reasons, and spends the rest of the film trying to cover his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of "justice". Along the way he gets involved in the stranger's wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to free his father from the murder. <br /> <br /> Incredibly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with a harsh and sparkling dialogue of Ben Hecht and a really powerful ending with elements of tragedy and grace found in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for the centuries and could be my favorite Preminger movie so far - it's just as good as the most announcer Laura.
