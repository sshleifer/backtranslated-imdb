The second film is about a young London woman desperate for a job, happy to accept a live secretary position with an old woman and her son. Thrillers about people in a house against their will always make me a little uncomfortable - I end up feeling like a prisoner too - but this rather classy film series is neither dirty nor claustrophobic. It is far-fetched and unlikely, but not disinterested, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick. Restructuring this in 1986 (as "Dead Of Winter") proved not wise, since the elements of the plot are not modern. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!), But it remains very well up to a too hurried climax, which seems a little neglected. *** from ****
