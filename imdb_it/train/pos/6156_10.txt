This film has always been my favorite for the Disney movie. Then, on 11/21/01, I saw the thirtieth edition of this DVD of the film. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so beautiful, it has an extra 30 minutes that the original didn't have. I didn't know when I started watching. Since then the film has been made much more. The music they cut should have been left. You have not seen this film until you have seen the full version of 131 min. Many people say that music is forgettable. I remember every song in this movie by heart, each song has its own charm, and it unites like a hole. I remember when I was younger I had the song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for days at a time. In addition to "Briny Sea" (that song was meant to marry Poppens but was cut off from the movie), please watch the new 30th aniversy uncut movie and re-vote for this movie. the 10 that it really is.
