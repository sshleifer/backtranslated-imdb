This movie is actually FUN! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then go ahead and watch it. It's called blonde and blonder, so don't expect deep and meaningful jokes. What a movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have of two blondes. It's just a fun movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends (especially if you're not too sober Lol) Pamela and Denise are still pretty pretty girls. It is a mistake to judge this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLOND! It should be light, fun and superficial. Another thing, I don't think girls will appreciate and appreciate this movie, but the guy will surely do it.
