I have observed "Dick Tracy" for years, and as a result it has become a vital part of my life - he has been with me throughout childhood and I saw him often. Seeing him now, as an adult, it is still a great film - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino received - apart from that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much noise when it came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is over-the-top but with a good effect since he is clearly having a lot of fun. Beatty is as big as Dick Tracy and behind the camera he manages to capture the atmosphere of a noir comic book movie better than any other film, maybe, I've ever seen. Just taking a look at a scene from the movie is breathtaking. The lighting, the velvet shades and the smog / smoke come together to create a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really fun cameos, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I don't think there are flaws in acting, even the obligatory baby character is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, a really cool movie that has been misunderstood in the years since its release and is incredibly underestimated with only 5.7 / 10 on IMDb. The reviews of the critics are very positive (take a look at RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film again it is not difficult to understand why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to style eccentricity. > <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
