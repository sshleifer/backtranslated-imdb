This film moves the story of Cinderella in the early 1950s and is the background, albeit eccentric, of the Isle of Man. around in various wonderful period costumes. The story is slightly different from the traditional version: at the beginning it is oddly combined with the plot of "King Lear", and in the later stages Cinderella is rather more assertive than usual. It looks gorgeous and works pretty well, but sometimes it happens to overdo it.
