Barriere seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time. After its broadcast in the early 1980s and a repeat, it has since sunk without a trace. This is a shame to cry. <br /> <br /> I originally looked at it when it was broadcast in the Southern TV region on Sunday afternoon and was the classic tea time view. Even though I don't remember much about the program, some things remained in my mind. The most notable were the unforgettable titles. The mournful flute music that accompanies the attempted escape across an eastern European border and the subsequent automobile accident (and that scene left me with the constant love for Mercedes "fintail" models that used a Merc 200). Although at first it was not obvious, the solution to the mystery of the series was in these titles. <br /> <br /> The plot of a young music student who tries to unravel what happened when he discovers he has been adopted a lot of twists, but Barriers was a surprisingly 'adult' children's drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame not to have done much more. <br /> <br /> This was a quality drama, late for a DVD release and I hope to have the chance to re-familiarize myself with it in the future. <br /> <br /> A beautiful memory of my childhood
