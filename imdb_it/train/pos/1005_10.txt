Verhoeven's film was completely garbage. It's a disgusting trick from a director and he should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored and decided to rebuild everything from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would NEVER support that garbage if he had been alive to see it. He practically steals the name, makes fun of the book's policy (which is a good part of it), and throws in a T & A so the average idiot of the American viewer does not get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not perfect, but at least for the most part accurate, as I can tell.
