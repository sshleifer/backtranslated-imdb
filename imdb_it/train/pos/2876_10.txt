The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites by Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty, also transformed into a Disney movie in 1959; this film is a sweet, enchanting Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film has a great soundtrack; what I like about a movie is a very good soundtrack, and I love songs too; my favorite song is the romantic "So This is Love". I also love the movie's mice, they're cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the birds tried to wake up Cinderella in the morning; I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (mice and birds) arrange Cinderella's mother's dress, so she can go to the dance ... until Drizella and Anastasia have torn him up into little pieces, ib ** **!
