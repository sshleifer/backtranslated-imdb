I started riding quite recently, and as anyone else has ever driven, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life with all the horse-related material I could, and I was surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a Disney movie of positive feelings with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got was a fantastic film, full of wonderful scenery and animations, and an incredible plot that has great potential to warm the heart. <br /> <br /> The spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose whole world is brought to collapse around him when he finds that humans are slowly taking over his native land. The story takes place with a wide range of characters, some humans, some animals, all are well written and most are nice to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> I will recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but which I think is important, is that the animals in this film don't talk. This was a nice vacation from Lady And The Tramp's animated movies that everyone is used to today.
