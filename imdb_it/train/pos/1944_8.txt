This is an excellent film about the characters of an adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions between them. It would have had to handle a wider distribution as it is much better than similar films from the major studios coming out simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor is a quasi-Olympic, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging by his female students. Try, more or less, to reject them, with different results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are US mainstream; teachers, policemen, university students and pensioners, all of whom have not learned to swim for some reason. The film covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they pass through the class. Several subplots provide fun food, including a teacher who divorced, some high school students who make a documentary and a girl who is alone in the class to meet boys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with a good date, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with nuances of reality.
