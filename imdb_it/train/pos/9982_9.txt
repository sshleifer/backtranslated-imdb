I saw this movie last night after waiting for age and age for it to be published here in Canada (still only in a limited version). It was worth the wait and then some. I am an avid reader of Margaret Laurence and I was happy to see that this novel had been turned into a movie. I actually ended up enjoying the film better than the novel. I liked the fact that Bram Shipley's character was a little less harsh, and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no more likeable in the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. It was Hagar for everything. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many other great things ahead of me I'm sure. His scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on, overall a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD, a must for my collection!
