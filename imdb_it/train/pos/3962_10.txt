Wonderful James Stewart, vehicle of Vera Miles. What makes this historical film very interesting with the FBI is the familiar element that is involved in a 35-year career as described by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows a story of the great detective agency. He deals with air raid plans, killing the Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gains, fighting organized crime, the Nazis and the communists in that order. The human element is never far behind as Stewart marries Vera Miles. They raise 3 children when Miles' heart goes out whenever Stewart goes on a mission. <br /> <br /> Look for a short but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later he appeared as Mr. Robinson in the 1967 movie "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. It certainly brought the FBI up to par. <br /> <br /> True, this could be seen as right-wing propaganda, particularly with Stewart's republican views, but it is well done, historically informative and the family's vision is so well represented.
