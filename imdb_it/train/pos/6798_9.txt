(No spoilers, just plot details) I can't understand such hatred for this episode. Want to see a bad episode of Smallville? Look underground - now there's a lot of shit. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say that very often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but it's more often than not. The scenario of the alternative universe seems strangely realistic. The Martian Manhunter, who previously appeared in "Static", returns and tells Clark that the doctor who is the head of the asylum where they are being held is actually a ghost from the ghost zone, and if Clark wants to return to his universe, he must killing it. A great general episode, with good acting and a decent step.
