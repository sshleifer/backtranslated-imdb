I voted 8 for this film due to some minor childish flaws. Besides this, this film is one of my favorites! It's funny to say the least. However, the shooting scenes are ridiculous, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) touches us a little too much about his "Matrix obsession". It seems their enemies are there ... waiting to be hit. However, this film is moving and always makes me cry. It has a lot of humor that way it makes me laugh as well. Gackt is an exceptional actor, I must say ... he shows so many emotions. This was the first time that Hyde acted and did well. The role adapts to him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely fantastic. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT LOSE! YOUR REGULATIONS!
