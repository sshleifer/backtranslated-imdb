"8 SIMPLE RULES ... TO GIVE MY TEEN DAUGHTER," is my opinion, it's a classic ABC absolute! I'm not sure I didn't see every episode, but I still liked it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always fun when an accident occurred. I always laughed at that. Although James Garner and David Spade were good, I enjoyed the show more when John Ritter was the protagonist. If you ask me, his sudden passage was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope that some networks will bring it back to the show for fans of the show.
