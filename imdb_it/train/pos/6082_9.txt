I've always liked Kenneth Branagh's versions of Shakespeare's classics, as he always does a great job, but in this film, the one who raises the entire film, is nothing but "the ever-great-actor" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he made some bad choices in the movies, even though he is a wonderful actor, but in this we are really given the real Othello: passion, the intensity of jealousy as he grows stronger next to Fishburne's well-interpreted paranoia and, moreover, a black Otello is finally given! <br /> <br /> I don't think they could have chosen a better Otello. Who else could have given him that mixture of sympathy / dislike, love / hate and, don't forget, those fiery eyes ...? Branagh is as good as ever, but not at his peak, Ir√©ne Jacob's Desdemona is quite good but a bit shabby, while Laurence Fishburne really does raise it and makes it a very interesting and fun movie. Watch it
