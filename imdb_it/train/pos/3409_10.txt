North Africa in the 1930s. To a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for a meaning for her life and a beautiful Trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith. They will meet and passions will mix, but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or pain, here, in the GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure hokum, but the film is still very funny and beautiful to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are a pair of superb screens. She is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and Boyer gives a more effective and sober performance, letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a nice role as Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly and talkative guide (all the "Arabs" whom he and others talk about in the film are pure and meaningless); Lucile Watson as a kind Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch is a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic goalkeeper; John Carradine as a mysterious Sand Diviner; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as an old wise priest. <br /> <br /> Movie stars will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (peering over the nun's shoulder) as convent girls; Nigel De Brulier foils as a monastery reader; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel employee, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The 1930s color films are both rare and adorable to watch, and this film is no exception - cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to shoot on the spot. Yuma, Arizona gave the directors all the sand dunes they could want, but contaminated drinking water and heat at 135 degrees soon had the company in revolt. When the rush of the day showed that Boyer's face had burned a bright red, producer David O. Selznick eventually gave up. The rest of the film was shot on a Hollywood stage.
