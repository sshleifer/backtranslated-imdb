Mainly it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the competition, but usually the directors start from a historical fact to talk about something else, or they also show the period before or after this fact, here everything happens during that couple of days when the revolution acts. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing how they were normal, not common heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it was made by the military army with the title, you can understand that they were just "understood" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and lights throughout the film, an excellent work for the director who is his first film, does not fall into the trivial way. Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. The character of Maia (the main one) is well done and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, able to show the limits of Maia, this not being a hero.
