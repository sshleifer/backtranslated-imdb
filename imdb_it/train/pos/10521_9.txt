Well, I guess I'm emotionally attached to this film because it's the first one I went to see more than 10 times in the cinema ... helping me with my master's thesis, or rather preventing me from working on it! > <br /> But after reviewing it for several years (and many many movies) later, what a little gem well done! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where does one meet such a man ??? <<< sigh >>> The vault of Sophie Thompson while Ms Bates is a virtuous acting of the best (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast does not disappoint either - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Of course sets and costumes, and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood, almost like the Hobbiton atmosphere of the film - although with regard to cinematography and artistic decoration, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very very pretty, but a little more austerity may have conveyed a sense of the best time. But the good thing is that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and there's a lot of fun - and some rather interesting editing - that keep you from sinking into the sickly Merry Old England mode. <br /> <br /> My particular, the favorite scene is the ball scene - a beautiful acting and directing here, and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley beautifully. Too bad the scene of the final proposal goes on for a while too long - it cuts two strokes (I can think of exactly which ones!) And it would have been much more in tune with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Damn, I realize (reading the imdb lists) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three films without even realizing that it was him - it seems to have much more success for him, as an actor, than be a gentleman's gentleman! Hmm, I think I have to pay a visit to my video store ... <br /> <br /> Nice movie. My favorite adaptation of Jane Austen so far - although perhaps Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility is, strictly speaking, the best film, this is my closest heart - and I've certainly seen it many more times! Watch it if you can - and don't be too hard with its small imperfections. <br /> <br />
