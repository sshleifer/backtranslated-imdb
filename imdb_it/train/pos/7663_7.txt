As a rule, a Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But since I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave a chance. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but it's something else. The film involves a fight with a mystical (evil) brother who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid is also dealing with people and authorities in the material world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions", and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard was blinded. His eyes are ruined pits. So the magician passes his hands through the eyes of the other, and hey, soon! His eyes have been restored! Apparently this kind of healing works only with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, Mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, the image is not bad at all, although very similar to a comic book. Dr. Mordred's more "human" adventures are going well, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot worse.
