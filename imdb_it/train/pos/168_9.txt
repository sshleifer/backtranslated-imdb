This is one of Joan Crawford's best talkies. It was Gable-Crawford's first pairing, and it made it clear to MGM and the public that they were a sparkling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly depicts the slide down of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must look after themselves and work for a living. Life is hard in the Depression and soon even their attempts to find a legitimate job prove vain, and resort to the activity of the underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as a socialite. It is intelligent, complex and credible. The theatrical rigidity of the early-talkie recitative style of the other actors also tends. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the-rough, masculine and gruff like the unscrupulous gangster who gets involved in the character of Crawford. The same year he would play a similar and more successful role with Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", securing his position as the best male sex symbol at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, don't miss "Paid", which he did a year earlier, which is also among his best early performances of Talkie. <br /> <br />
