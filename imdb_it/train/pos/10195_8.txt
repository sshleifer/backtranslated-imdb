Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who is often better than his material and almost always underestimated. He has been in a ton of movies both as a heavy and a hero, and has the kind of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can deliver material that would seem ridiculous to come out of another actor, and this is what is so beautiful for him. He really seems to understand what he is saying, no matter how clich√©, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's what made the WALKING TALL trilogy so well-functioning, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a remarkable success in cinemas and videos in the 1980s, and has aged much better than many of the perhaps best-known action films of the time. By moving action from Texas to Europe, there is a timeless quality that does not distance you from the action on the screen. To be honest, I've always liked the Greydon Clark movie, which is an unscrupulous director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood of the 70s, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 1980s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence. I suppose if they do this with The Rock, a new audience will love it as much as I do.
