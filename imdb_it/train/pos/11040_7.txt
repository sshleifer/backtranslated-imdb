I saw this French horror film last night and loved it. The entire film takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a handwritten diary in a wall by a serial killer who had escaped the prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. As they look through the diary, they discover that it goes into the black arts and the commands that could be their way out of the cell and from freedom. What they discover is something completely different and nothing short of terrifying. I like low-budget horror films, which deliver goods in a fairly quality way and tell a good story. This film does just that, despite the fact that it takes a while to get going. The result and the horror they trigger is very interesting for me, and I liked the trip. Not a lot of cold blood, but it wouldn't be suitable for the story, even if the blood it has is pretty good.
