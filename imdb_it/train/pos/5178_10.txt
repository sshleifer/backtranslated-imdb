Before Tuscan Sky, I saw the tender performance of Diane Lane in this movie scene. Campers are invited to their youth camp and live there as adults. Each of those who return seem to look for something they have lost, which makes it so realistic. Maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of a character who noticed all his clothes were wet "this is so camp!" From practical jokes and fights for boyfriends, to the dreadful lunch lady and early morning bell ... it's the amp. Once the exciting activities now seem trivial. A formidable cast of actors makes the best of two-dimensional roles and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he first fell in love with her !!) The beautiful scenery, the bright colors, the comic music (including variations by Hello Muddah) and a comedic turn of the well-known director Sam Raimi make this a film that you can pull off again and again as you look for an old friend.
