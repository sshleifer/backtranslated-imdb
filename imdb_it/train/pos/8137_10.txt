If you like CB4, you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this movie yet. This movie is hilariously crazy and incorporates much more into the hip hop industry than any other film about parody ... It's a shame that this movie wasn't released on DVD because it's a movie that I have all seen with loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old school artists, definitley rents this movie. There are not many places to rent videos that have a copy, but if you happen to find one you won't be disappointed.
