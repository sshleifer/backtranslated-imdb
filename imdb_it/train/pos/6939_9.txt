I was very impressed with this film. I should classify it as one of the best westerns of the classical era. I say this for everything: acting, mature dialogue, absurd history and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who has made several well-photographed film noir around this same era, has also made some Westerners like this. It has the same film noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart have collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend Mann-Stewart's movie "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> Simply put, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam," (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won in a fair-and-square race . It is then stolen and transmitted from bad to bad. All these bad guys are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Aiding Stewart recites this interesting story to include Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All are fun to watch. However, it was a bit difficult to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can't have everything.
