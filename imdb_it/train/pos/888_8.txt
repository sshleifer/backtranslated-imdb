One of the best kung fu movies, but not entirely flawless as I had hoped given the brilliant reviews. The film starts quite well, with the lines that are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than one might think for this era) and make passages of dialogue that are not fought passable (for a kung fu movie, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which have always been vintage pieces or (in the wake of the detective drama by Jackie Chan, Police Story I), Pedicab Driver takes a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the film we need a swoop in the tragedy of the dark melodrama that I thought was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The action is overall good, with a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of the Solo 2-star of Shaw Brothers, Kar-Leung Lau and then a quarrel at the end with that taller guy who always plays the villain of Jet Li. Here are only 20 minutes of combat, which is standard, but what bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera frames. I understand that they have to film at half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth changes and then there is this. It really takes away the fighting when it's obvious that the footage was messed up. <br /> <br /> That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here won't dissuade you, and if you don't, you've just lost 2 minutes of your life reading this.
