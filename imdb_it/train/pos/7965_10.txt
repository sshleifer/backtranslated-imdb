This film was fantastic ... it made me laugh, it's a lament, and above all there are talking animals! this movie should be seen by all types of people! it's one of my favorite movies, and I like it so much I just had to comment on it !!! it's rox! it is so heartfelt and a wonderful plot that it is a great and heartfelt movie! My favorite character is the shadow. this because I think it is the most interesting and fascinating. I had a golden retriever just like the shadow, I miss it so much !!! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart !! this film is the best I like and everyone should! Love your pets, no matter what they do, they keep them forever !!!
