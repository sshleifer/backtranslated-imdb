For Muslim women in West Africa, married life at the hands of violent husbands can be very difficult. The community cannot explicitly approve this behavior, but in the same way, it may not yet be ready to view it as a criminal, an attitude that naturally allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of the Cameroonian law promises equality to all, and this documentary follows the true exploits of various women practicing in the Cameroonian legal system while attempting to ensure justice for a number of women and children. What is remarkable (apart from the central edifying history) is how, despite their informality, the courts are actually pragmatically progressive, if a case is actually purchased. The program also offers a fascinating insight into the entire Cameroonian lifestyle, which (apart from the terrible crimes committed in the cases described) seems incredibly emotional and joyful compared to that enjoyed by the inhabitants of Europe or North America. And while I admit that this comment can betray naivety on my part, this attitude seems to be captured in the delicious pidgin English they speak. Overall, this is a fantastic movie and much more fun to watch than you can imagine.
