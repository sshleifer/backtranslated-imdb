Walking with the Cavemen, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a look back at all the species of hominids (which we are!) Of the last 5 million years: who they were, how they were and how they died out. In addition to being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species, Walking with Cavemen also examines what makes us human. I waited several weeks to see this, and I was not disappointed.
