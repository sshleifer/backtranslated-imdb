I really enjoyed this movie as a kid. At that age I thought silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was "nice" because of the sport. Now, several years later, I can look back and see which movie was well designed. This film opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles that other children have faced and real world issues. That kind of exposure is largely lacking in children's movies these days which I don't think is beneficial to our society. Of course, the antics of baseball seem really stupid now, but they have attracted children. No seven-year-old is going to ask to see a film about foster children, but they will ask to see a baseball movie. Disney realized this and took the opportunity to teach these children an important lesson about the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems much less impressive, however I will credit the actors who play both children and Danny Glover who did a fantastic job.
