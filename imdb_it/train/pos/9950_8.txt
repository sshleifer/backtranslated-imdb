Very nice action with an intertwined story that really doesn't suck. Interesting enough to deserve to be looked at instead of jumping over to get to the good parts. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere also helps revive it. Jenna in that sweater and those glasses is simply stunning! It's worth picking it up just to see it!
