I saw him recently on the Sundance channel. The idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers, illustrious in their country, to make short films, eleven, all in one film, focusing on one topic: 11 September. <br /> <br /> By wacthing this film I could understand why these directors were fantastic in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a film from Iran in which a teacher struggles to teach students what happened on September 11th that they can't accomplish until later. <br /> <br /> The second French film involves a deaf woman who writes a letter to her lover angrily while not aware of what is happening like TV The next film from Egypt involves the director himself talking with a soldier dead of recent events not only on the terrorists of September 11 but also on the bombings in other places. <br /> <br /> The next one is from Bolivia where a girl learns about the events of September 11th and believes they should march for them. <br /> <br /> The next from a country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man who they believe to be Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Mexico where nothing is shown, but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> The next from Israel involves a reporter on the scene of a bomb trying to get a report, but is often informed about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other films that I can remember at the moment, but all are powerful. You will return your emotions from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
