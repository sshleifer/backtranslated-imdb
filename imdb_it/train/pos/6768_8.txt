One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, he started to go down when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to watch her as Ernest Borgnine's character confronted each other. The last episode in which he appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately in those days, blacks didn't last long in TV shows. Some of the episodes of the second season went well, but the third season was more about Airwolf's human characters and was not shown until almost the end of the show. When he went to the United States, it was disgusting !!!
