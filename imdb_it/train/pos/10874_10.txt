<br /> <br /> I must admit that I was expecting something very different from my first vision of "Cut" last night, although he was delighted by the unexpected jewel of Australian horror. I'm a real horror fan as they came, and I found 'Cut' not only the best of the kind that Australia has ever produced, but one of the great parodies / comedies recently. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the mainstream public does not notice many comic elements - the film was not too clever in its application but it made me laugh at every corner trying to adapt to EVERY possible clich√© of the horror genre they could. I am sure that this was meant as humor .... hoping that this was meant as humor. <br /> <br /> And of course there was blood. <br /> <br /> The use of the 'personalized' "The garden shears were ingenious - in addition to the lacquers and the cuts envisaged. In short, there was an enormous amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths , enough to satisfy even the skeptics of this film. <br /> <br /> The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the film - both performances were fantastic, as was Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as a jokey technician. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this film is one of the best horror products of the last two years, as well as a nice satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek until the end. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it.
