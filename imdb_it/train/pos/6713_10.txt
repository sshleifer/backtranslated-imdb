I liked this TV show because it was something that a girl in her sixteenth birthday discovers is a witch and lives with her aunts at home and they are both witches. Well, it took her about a couple of weeks to get used to it. When he used his powers for the first time it was so much fun because he turned his enemy into a pineapple. He had to go back in time and repeat one day. This series is very beautiful and is a typical adolescent series, but when she moved from home and into an apartment with her college mates she became boring and then she became boring and I stopped watching. I loved her aunts were so funny and the other one was really smart. I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy, Libby, she was ugly.
