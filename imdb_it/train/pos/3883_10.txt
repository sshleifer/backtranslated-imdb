Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I have it now! It's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself completely in his art, then in Eddie. I couldn't stop laughing for the whole show. If you feel like laughing, you MUST see this special!
