Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at this HBO comedy show. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and even Michael Jackson. The Ice Man Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also fun. I saw it for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard that I almost fell off my chair. I still think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh so hard, he's one of the best people coming out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best stand up performance next to "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I gave "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 inches up and 10/10 stars.
