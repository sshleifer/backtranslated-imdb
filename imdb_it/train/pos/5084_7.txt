I was surprised that "The Secret Fury" was a good movie ...... Probably because, I had no expectations for this film ..... However, the film has its holes in the plot ..... I would say that you could not guess who was behind the whole scheme, until the end of the film ..... At the beginning, I thought, it was Robert Ryan, using the same method, as "Gaslight" where the husband tries to do crazy his wife, but I was wrong ... The main problem with the film is that they drive in another direction, which at the beginning did not give any clue. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert wore their parts well ...... Furthermore, Vivian Vance, a refined character actress, who steals scenes in this ...... Who loves movies , which makes you guess, will like this ......
