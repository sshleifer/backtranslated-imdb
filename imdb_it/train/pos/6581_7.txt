Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this 1985 version that looked interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Very one type of film by Ken Russell: eccentric, stylized, very artistic and, of course, "different". Black was presented not so much as embodied evil, but as an extravagant and dissatisfied emperor who would have preferred a circus career. He probably wondered why he had been put in the position of "leading" an empire - it wasn't very funny, and the fun was what he wanted. Klause Maria Bandaur had an incredible time with this role and played it for everything that was worth. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with a vengeance; one of the many who did it. At one point one of his henchmen murmurs: "No one will ever understand that we are simply protecting ourselves". He got it right.
