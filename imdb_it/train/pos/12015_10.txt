At the beginning this film would have been the typical western movie, however it turned out to be very interesting and enchanted me to the last, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", '76, has had past experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", '93, and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing for make sure you reached with him and returned it. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey, (Susan Burgade), "The Portrait of a Lady", '96, managed to get herself involved in this situation and found herself among sex-hungry men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions and I was rather surprised at the conclusion. This is a very funny film and the acting was exceptional.
