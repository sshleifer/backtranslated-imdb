I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but his concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It aroused my interest, but I never expected it to be so beautiful. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece and is also one of the most romantic films ever recorded. To my surprise, the cynicism of the 1990s was completely missing. It is impossible to talk about it too much, because there is no real storyline, so to speak (although there are many really interesting things you could talk about, it's a bit like My Dinner With Andre, where there's a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that matters), but just let me say, see it. WATCH IT!
