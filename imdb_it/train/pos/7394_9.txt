This Chinese film made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture that I don't belong to and that are far away. In a quasi-Buddhist approach, the film helps to relate to each character, and with the happiness of doing simple routine things. <br /> <br /> All the actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu exudes goodness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and bad. Er Min, the retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not the same, and that wisdom comes from and for the most disparate people in this universe. A different China, this is far from Chinese realism, however, it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Take it. You will not be disappointed.
