In this film the year 2022 looks a lot like the seventies. This is fun at the beginning, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite appearances, how many things we take for granted may become unavailable. <br /> <br /> Characters often interact in a particular way, without tact or manner or respect. I think this is intentional, not bad acting. After all, those who witnessed social changes in the 1960s and 1970s may well think that in 2022 the inhabitants of an overpopulated city behave like this. <br /> <br /> I didn't like most of the action scenes, apart from the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The plot is not too shiny. But the big scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol, the way the rioters and corpses are treated, the "furniture" - overcome the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
