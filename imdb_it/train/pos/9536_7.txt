Unbalanced and graphically grueling Japanese film on small beings that take people and turn them into necroborg-zombie machines like beating and engraving each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this a pair of lovers becomes infected. <br /> <br /> The technically superb horror comedy (?) Is only for those with a strong stomach while blood and body parts fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but lets just say that it is rather macabre. If you like this kind of thing with the form of several steps above the lean content by all means see this movie. Personally, I'm usually not used to watching movies like this on something, but how sick and twisted they are. Here I was intrigued enough to be able to suggest to people I know who really likes bloody movies. It's also a movie with enough detail in the details that I want to see it since I know what was happening, as revealed at the end, I want to go back and see what I did not understand. There is a rare internal logic in these films. <br /> <br /> 7ish out of 10 for those who love blood and cut limbs, it is a zero or more precisely a running alarm and hide-and-seek for everyone else.
