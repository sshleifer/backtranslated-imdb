2 WORDS: Oscar winner. Nuff said. This film had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. Acting was the tip of every independent film. Jeremy Earl was in great shape for a long time seen from his time at the Joan Cusack Show. His jokes were performed with dynamite precision and witty spirit, seen for the last time in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next emergency of a young Denzel Washington when the phrase "My bus !! It's .... Gone" was the real turning point of the film. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart when you see the white Tony Donato and the African American bond of Nathan Davis. Through the dense (held back with a knife) and thin (Nathan giving Tony advice on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and is about to conquer Hollywood.
