Here in Brazil it is very rare to see a good Brazilian film, and Brant's new film is exactly one of these jewels. There are some flaws in the film, of course, but they are really minimal. The direction and the acting in this film are very good! <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see another new Brant movie!
