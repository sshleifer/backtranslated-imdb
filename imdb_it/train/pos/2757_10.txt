If you would like to see a film of a different genre, if you feel the Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Even if Georges is mentally handicapped, in the end you can see the ultimate intelligence, when love gives you directions not on the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is not enough advertising to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (The color of the god) by Majid Majidi is another example of foreign films, almost with similar tastes.
