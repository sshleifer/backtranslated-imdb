Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this - the others in the film are also fantastic. The Dialogue is excellent and very, very funny - and the scene where the character of Lemmon tries to free his breasts in a restaurant makes me roll on the floor with laughter every time I see him. Anyone who has seen the not so great sequel should not be removed from the original. I recommend this wonderful film to everyone - I love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so direct with tragic nuances does nothing but increase the exhilaration in my opinion. These two big boys have made a series of films together, but this is the best - without a doubt.
