Is it ironic that during the 1950s, when Douglas Sirk had the greatest success in terms of public appeal, he was practically ignored by critics ?? Now he is seen as a director of formidable intellect who got his best work in melodrama ?? <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" talks about the fall of a Texan oil dynasty surrounded by a useless reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania ?? It's about the twisted and fatal connections between sex, power and money ... <br /> <br /> Stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunkard destroyed by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, madness and some deep insecurities ? ? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone succeeds as an attractive woman with excessive sexual appetite, degrading herself for Hudson and other companions in the city ?? His best line: "I'm dirty". In a frenetic scene, do we see her tremble, tremble and sweat a provocative mambo ?? In another cry alone on a model of an oil tower on his father's desk, a symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny ?? <br /> <br /> The hectic atmosphere is palatable and intensified by the magnificent use of colors, Sirk lights and careful use of mirrors ??
