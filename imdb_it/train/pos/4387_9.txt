This is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is pure and direct. Indeed, it is the standard story of a simple and honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the most educated and wealthiest men of the period. <br /> <br /> Poor against rich, honorable and dishonorable, a classic but well-told tale without much of the Hollywood pomp that smells on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost smell people on the screen. :)
