China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was directed by veteran Robert Clouse. Unfortunately he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost his touch because he is not a great director. The only reason to watch this film is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been an action classic instead of an action movie straight to the video. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help his father. He has problems with the local crowd and needs his help. He then returns home and restores the order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mr. Big and his evil friends? <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, then this movie will satisfy you. I only liked the fight scenes, everything else is rubbish. Why didn't Raymond Chow distribute some shekels and hire a top-notch action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
