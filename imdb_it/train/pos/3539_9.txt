Good: involving cinematic gunfights, excellent presentation, the vehicles are really fun to drive, quite captivating multiplayer, faithful to the film, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: The main missions are a bit short. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third-person shooter (not necessarily a spy game) is. Great firefights carry the story forward and make you want to complete EVERY mission, and unlock all the real bonuses the game has to offer. The hype of this game has been up to it, and I personally think you should buy it and connect with a couple of friends and play this. A lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound of this game, is an amazing result of some previous bond games, and firing a weapon, it really seems to shoot a weapon. It ties in with the appearance that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after overcoming the challenge, and some multiplayer that can compete with the cunning James Bond game "Nightfire" for gamecube.
