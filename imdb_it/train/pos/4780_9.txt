He always imagined this film from the cover of the video. Eventually he came to buy it for a five in a sale and boy what a movie. A performance that is simply stunning from all cases and is filmed in a wonderful way. Even sometimes from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you were really that far away collecting pieces of the story. It's really moving, often fun and very watchable. There is not much dialogue, but it is filmed in such a way as to make you feel so much. A 9/10 from me. A must see
