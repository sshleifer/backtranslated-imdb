I consider myself a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing film ever made. This is the Robert Wise / Paul Newman film "Somebody Up There Mikes Me". That movie could be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a closed number 2. <br /> <br /> The film is not just about the rise of James J. Corbett, but also shows the sport of boxing in a crucial moment of the transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of the rules with bare hands to the "gentler" days of the glove, the rules of the Marquis of Queensbury. And the sport was moving away from the times when it was an illegal show and towards a time of acceptance and respectability. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look at that time. It is romanticized and, yes, sometimes even a little stingy. But always so deliciously. Errol Flynn is perfect as the "Gentleman" Jim who is not really a "gentleman" but simply a quick talker of a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite charming as the upper-class woman with whom she has a love / hate relationship (and we all know that it is, of course, the love that will win that game at the end). <br /> <br /> At the end of "Gentleman Jim" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT "I can lick any man in the world" of course ... romance again) delivers his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes of any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, look at "Raging Bull" instead. This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is a lot more fun.
