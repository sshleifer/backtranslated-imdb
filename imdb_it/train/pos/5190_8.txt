The pros of this film are the amazing fighting scenes - absolutely incredible sword moves and martial art on display. A true masterpiece by John Woo. The story tends to be a bit of a week, but it never obscures the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art actions. If you like martial arts movies, you'll love this!
