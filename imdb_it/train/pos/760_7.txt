I hadn't seen this film since the late 80s and decided to take back the VHS version. The plot is very slow and the actors seem almost robotic in this breakdance movie. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdance scenes are what make this film special. Breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin" ", but I have to say that" Breakin '1 & 2 "brings energy and excitement to the screen much better. it's not a movie I can watch over and over again, just once in a blue moon.
