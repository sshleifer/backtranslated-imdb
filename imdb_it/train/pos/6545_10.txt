I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews have been bad, but most critics think a movie should be like a drama of ideas. This film has a bit of drama, but the rest is just fun and very funny. Forget that Julia Roberts is a cute woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful girl and there's so much more to her. Emma was so much fun to watch as Nancy Drew. It's nice to see a new face. I think it will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other characters actors and secondary actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - uncredited. I'm surprised that Disney didn't release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and curse. This is a good family movie that is rare on this day in time. Bring your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how beautiful it is. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
