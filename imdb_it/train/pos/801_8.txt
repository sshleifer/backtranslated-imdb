I suppose JEDI is now chronologically considered the last "last" entry in the popular saga, and it is very good, as were many of these. I liked the way this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated Luke Skywalker's maturity as a character (and also Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the exciting chase in the woods, and felt that there was a lot of well done excitement with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I assume?) Successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy tale. I know that many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes made to the original films, but being a relatively novice of these films rather late in life and I don't miss what I didn't know, I think he made these 6 films work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and, err, Carrie Fisher looked delicious in her skimpy dress.
