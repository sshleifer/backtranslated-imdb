Watching this movie from beginning to end without bursting out laughing at some point requires almost an act of faith, as we must continue to say to ourselves, "is old", "is a classic", "be gentle", because the film is so bad, but because at its best it is so beautiful. This is a dated film. It is also a classic, if it is oxidized. However I am not inclined to laugh at people, in principle, and when others do I am a bit irritated. To tease The Informer in my mind is a bit like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, yet when he is at the top of his game he is also a true savant. The same goes for The Informer, which is sometimes really terrible, yet it boasts beautiful photographs, a beautiful acting, a wonderful soundtrack and a simple and good story. In the end, that I don't want to give away, politics, religion and psychology come together in a church, in such a way as to make the scene seem banal and over the top, yet so is life sometimes. Ignorant people of simple faith behave differently from us (supposedly brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. Yet people behave that way, they say things like that. Not everyone is fashionable, and it may not even be desirable that everyone is fashionable. Are people today so superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago? And how? I don't think so. We're just different. Now go see the movie.
