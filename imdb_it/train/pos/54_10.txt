The Home Room takes care of a high school shot similar to Columbine, but rather the case where the film portrays the consequences and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and rejection. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action scenes other than the reaction of an almost adolescent SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime whose convicts were not convicted and two teenagers who survived the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing in common besides the shooting they are put together because of that and it follows the drama. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 have been around the block so much that cinema viewers know very well her solid and reliable acting style. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and completely unknown to me, shocked me with his overwhelming dramatic force and stage presence. This girl was the part. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic film and it connects to you with its intimate attention to the fragile and growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003), although good, seems almost superficial and miserable compared to Home Room when it comes to drama and acting. What I see is that this film had very little screen time and visibility - much more a loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
