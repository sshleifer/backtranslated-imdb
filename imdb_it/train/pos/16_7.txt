I found this novel-drama so romantic that it has a pleasant ending and a pleasant general feel. It is not a family film like Hall Hall Fame with sleep before marriage considered a "normal" behavior, but since he plays Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a much rougher film, at least for the language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is the representation of how difficult it is to learn to read and write when you are already an adult. This is the main theme of the film and involves some moving scenes but, to be honest, the film is not that memorable. <br /> <br /> It is still a fairly mild and pleasant story that I would be happy to recommend.
