Saving Grace is a good movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when you are looking for something different from normal scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana in it is so crazy! It was the first film I saw with this theme (drug / marijuana) that is not criticizing him, just kidding. Grace Trevethyn is a widow, who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her late husband, who has committed suicide since he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who has imagined having some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds into debts so as not to lose all her belongings, especially her home that she loves so much . He has never worked before, and finds himself in a tragic situation until Matthew, his gardener who is very used to smoking weed, decides to forge a partnership with her in selling large-scale marijuana.
