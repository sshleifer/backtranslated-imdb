I like ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, rumors that cannot be explained. Now I've seen many of them. As a special efx they have more and more control over today's movies, sometimes to find a real gem, you have to go back to the time when writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this very rare pilot episode of the TV series Ghost Story entitled "The New House" was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but nothing even compared to it since. With all the remake going on in Hollywood, someone should do it "as is" without a more special efx than the original. This episode was truly terrifying to die for. I'm lucky to finally find it on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 ghost stories to approach were the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". You want someone to do more ghost stories like these.
