On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a filthy soap opera about the sexual dysfunction of a Texas oil family. But below is a profound social commentary on the life of the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk still marks with another universal sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that even Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, loves her. When Stack turns out to be sterile and Bacall ends up pregnant, the fireworks fly. And, all-too-good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrayl of the biggest Texan nymphomaniac that is avoided by Hudson. Good epic soap opera.
