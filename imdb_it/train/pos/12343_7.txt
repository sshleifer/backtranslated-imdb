Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film - the cinematography, the music and the costumes are wonderful. In reality, this film is more beautiful than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the film as it was made several years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, as far as writing is concerned, the dialogue was well written and the story, at times, was interesting. However, the story was also rather depressing but somewhat uninspiring - after all, it's the story of a group of women working in a brothel. It is interesting to note that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable activity in Japan, women STILL want a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, even if the characters of Streets Of Shame are much less nice and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So, on the whole, he gets a 7 - mainly because of everything BUT writing. Too bad that the weakest link in this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
