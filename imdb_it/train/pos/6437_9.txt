A famous conductor decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There, he comes to Dutch with the local church choir, which will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I first saw this movie yesterday; I like watching foreign films that are not English, and I've already seen a couple of Swedish films in my life, but this was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, one of which is exceptional acting. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as the caring, almost shy and devoted director Daniel Daréus. The beautiful Frida Hallgren enchants with her beautiful smile and her subtle acting. The members of the choir are all well-developed and interesting characters with their own history. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who dedicated his life to music, and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life was until then. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are creators of exceptional films. Go see Så som i himmelen, it's a film that makes you think about life and love, and that is also comforting, somehow.
