Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the Horror genre. As I understand from the comment and the things I read, it was done during the huge flood of the Midwest of 1993 when half of Missouri was underwater. The buildings were underwater. the cars and houses were underwater. An article said that the zombies and crew of this film would help to plunder the river after firing every day. The fact that this film was made is a miracle. It's like a huge crush of every zombie film ever made through a Troma filter. It's a party movie to have fun with friends who like a lot of splatters and stupid characters. And it's fast and energetic and really fun. <br /> <br /> A toxic spill incident at a nuclear power plant causes people to melt or turn into zombies. The local government covers it, tears the factory and builds houses above it. Some earth shifts (?) Cause the opening of a cave and some new residents find the cave and free the undead in the newly built community. From there it becomes just crazy and bloody and fun. <br /> <br /> I've read these reviews here a few times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this funny little movie three times as another reviewer, using fake names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. He has some bad acting. So does half of the films made. There's a lot MORE out there than this funny movie. If you hate this movie so much, don't buy it. No need for personal attacks and to call the "Trailer Trash" crew or cast. And it is obvious that you are not from Australia or England. It is really upsetting that this great service, the IMDb, does not capture the people who use it only to sweep others. There are bad reviews and positive reviews, and I don't mind. I give both bad and good reviews. But it is painfully obvious that some fool just want to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "Reviewers" essentially sue their "review" only to promote their own films. One called this movie Boring - well, I love it or hate it, one thing you can NEVER say about this movie is that it's boring. He moves quickly and never has a dull point. <br /> <br /> Oh and this review from the Netherlands ??? Um - LIAR. You tried posting the same review on Amazon and we pulled up. The SAME review said only that it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense must end. Love it or Hate it - give it a real review or don't write anything. It is obvious that you have not seen the films. <br /> <br /> But for the record, I have and although this is not the best I've seen, it is far from the worst. And even the worst I would give an actual REVOEW and I would not personally attack the director. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help some people see through the stupidity that is happening here.
