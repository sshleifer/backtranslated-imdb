This film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for TV, but it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The film and its actors have won several awards. It is compelling, fascinating and will absorb you completely. The story of a chase for an iron curtain killer by people willing to risk their careers to try to save the lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were a fiction - but it's apparently a true story. I highly recommend it.
