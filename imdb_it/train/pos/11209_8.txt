Buddy is a fun family movie set in an age where "humanizing" animals and making them cute was an acceptable way to get people interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do everything for each other. <br /> <br /> While not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is almost realistic most of the time and the chaos that occurs inside the house is usually fun for the children. <br /> <br /> This film lacks an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets, but shows the difficulties. <br /> <br /> A recommended film that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
