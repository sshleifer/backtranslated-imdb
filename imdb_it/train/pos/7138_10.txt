If John Thaw had never played "Morse", "Kavanagh", or starred in "The Sweeney" and in other productions, he would have been remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> Sustainably supported by an equally extraordinary performance by his co-star (the young Nick Robinson in his first role), and a discreet cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's fascinating novel is a memorial suitable for his art. <br /> <br /> When I read this story of an old fellow Norfolk widower who was to house a boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious time line error in it, and the credit must go to the creators of this film to rectify this mistake. They must also be applauded for not overly sentimentalizing the story, and preventing what could have been transformed, quite easily, into a mushy mess. <br /> <br /> If you keep a CD or a video library, then this is nice made for TV movie is an absolute inclusion.
