WARNING!!! TONS OF DEAD FAITH !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> They are few words to describe a film that claims to be the last and comes out with another; Liars, tricks, maybe even some words that can't be spoken. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought that the series was getting old, and wanted to stop seeing it, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) stopped only for his last breath, this movie was . <br /> <br /> This film begins with a parody of Wizard of Oz, Then you see a child who is called only as John Doe, who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and leaves Freddy's territory. A woman who resides in a hospital / place to entertain children in a place like this meets this boy and, at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower and the promise of a secret that floats in his mind, go back to Springwood to understand this terrifying vision, and soon discover that you are Freddy's daughter, and soon we will find out that Freddy can leave Springwood only if his daughter can be a kind of guest for him. And beyond that, fear ensues. This film seems to have hit the head on everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of humor and cameo appearances, like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and a very young Breckin Meyer who plays a teenage stoner who sees the psychadelic vision of flowers and "In-a-gadda-da-vida" by Iron Butterfly, then hangs in a sort of parody of Mario super. This movie will make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more. The best of the best.
