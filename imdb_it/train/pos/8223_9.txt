WHEN I saw this film for the first time, in London, in 1958, I let myself go. I've never seen a movie like this before. It had a strange hypnotic effect, somewhat different from the films I had seen before and left a lasting impact. I believe that Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Of course the interaction is incredible in its power to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this was converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I'd like to hear it and where it can be purchased.
