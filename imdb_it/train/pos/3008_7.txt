The imperturbable William Powell. It is a joy to look at the screen as it makes its way through situations without any worries in the world. He always seems to be at the top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts it. Murders are projects, barely human. I noticed that this is a fixed point of the whodunnit. Other than an occasional weeping widow, the victims perform the function of being the reason the film exists. Nothing more. There are enough turns and turns to keep things interesting along the way and Powell is a master at this. There is a lot of political incorrectness, especially with regards to Asian artists. This is a little difficult to take. The cast is fantastic, and Curtiz's management is also a substantial resource.
