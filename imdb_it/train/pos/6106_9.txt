As for the erotic genre, I'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch. This film is different. Julie Davis (I Love You Do Not Touch Me) has directed two very strong actors, Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery, in this thrilling thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim", a sweet innocent love novelist who is captured in the storyline of Doug Jeffery's "The Man" seduction, a good-looking stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role, and as an actress, giving what could have simply been another T and a depth and credibility. I think it's still his best performance. And directed by Julie Davis is a great gift for eroticism.
