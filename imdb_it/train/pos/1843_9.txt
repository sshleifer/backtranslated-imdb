This drama is different from Sex and the City, where women drink a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. It is much more personal and people can relate to it. It's much more engaging and exciting on a new level than other women-centered dramas and their lives like "Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle ...." <br /> <br /> Dr. Katie Roden, it's a psychologist with a dark secret, she seems much more depressed and full of guilt than the rest of her 3 friends. It has to do with the death of his former lover who was his patient while he was facing his son's advances on her. Her dark clothes and the empty and cold house convey her emotions very well. <br /> <br /> Trudi Malloy, a widow has been struggling with "letting go" of her late husband since 9/11. And when a handsome stranger, Richard shows an interest in her, she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she returns to the dating business. The ridiculous and embarrassing courtship scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her to come out the day she gets a million from the September 11th council for her husband's death ... look at her intentions <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon, a lawyer is fed up with the love of her husband who creates tactics that only involve "being a child" (because they have problems conceiving) and soon falls in love with her colleague who offers her "services" a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate to long! interesting to see if her relationship continues or patched up with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica, a real estate business woman is single and is heterosexual, until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has a relationship with one of them. His character is shown as a daring and provocative woman who is having sex with a "married man", his colleague, before his lesbian encounter. Let's see where his character ventures .... <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 completely different women with different scenarios, whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. It is also a good thing that drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends find each other to be "safe"!
