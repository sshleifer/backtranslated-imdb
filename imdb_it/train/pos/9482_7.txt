Henri Verneuil represented commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box office, and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful stories of casino theft, mafia fights and battles of World War II, Verneuil could be counted to give us two solid hours of fun on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his time: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... Hi Icare is the only time he has directed Yves Montand. It is a strangely static film, which takes place mainly in offices and conference rooms, which contains not a chase scene and almost no violence. <br /> <br /> Montand offers a good performance, although a little dry, and is well supported by other actors. I could not help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, based on Z (the murder of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by the Stalinists).
