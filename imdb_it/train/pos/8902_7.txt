I imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would become an icon and started "Wanted: Dead of Alive" in the same year that this movie came out, or he would be on The Magnificent Seven two years later, he wouldn't have done it. But he did, and we are richer. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a classic in the field. Horror as it should have been for the drive-in theater. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the last lines of the film were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> <br /> They would have never imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would melt. The Blob will be back soon.
