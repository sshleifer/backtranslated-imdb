When I found this movie in my local videostore I expected it to be another American-style vampire movie in the same vein as "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise "To Die for" is a really beautiful film. It's a little bit trivial at times, but there are still enough style sets and surprises to satisfy vampire fans. This is a perfect mix of romance and horror and is surprisingly gory at times. Highly recommended.
