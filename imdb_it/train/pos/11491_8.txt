The Unborn is a very, very different film. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the film and have performed quite well. this film is solid and keeps you going. Although I think you have to be a horror fan to see it because of the scenes and the plot. There is a brief sex scene without nudity that may have been left out and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me who is in the movie and thinks that it ruins a good movie, but that's when it comes to that. There is a scene where the character of Adams goes crazy and kills a cat, but you can say that it is not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in My Opinion is a truly creepy film that is superbly unpredictable and is rather strange! I recommend all the horror fans to this movie!
