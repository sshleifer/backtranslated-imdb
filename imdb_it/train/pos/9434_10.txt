I remember seeing this film on TV a few years ago and not paying the utmost attention, perhaps even missing the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and overrated. I decided to see him again last night to see if I had missed something the first time. I certainly did it. This is one of the most disturbing and surprising films of all time and has clearly had a lot of influence on today's films and probably will be forever. I can't believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give their career performances and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and terror for a long time after watching it, it's really terrifying. Oh, and did I mention that the theme song is great too? Well, it is, and this movie should be seen by fans around the world. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this film for the experience. Don't expect a picnic.
