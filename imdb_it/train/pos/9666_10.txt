Bette Midler is divine again! Definitely fun. In love with Burlesque. Able to break down to tears with old jokes with new clothes or simply with old songs with more power and power than ever. All in All Singing new ballads, singing the old perennials like "The Rose"; "Stay With Me" and yes, even "Wind Beneath My Wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been freedom - since this is the best thing that follows, I warmly recommend everyone with a mixture of spell and adult appreciation and a child's malicious desire to push all borders!
