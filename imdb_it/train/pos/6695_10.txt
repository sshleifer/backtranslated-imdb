Oh my God, I live in Kentucky and when Mellisa Joan came to Louisville she walked through my neighborhood and waved to me I'm so full of crap so she wanted to see my neighborhood oh and I love being rich in all the ways it is coming for the Derby returning to my interest in the show ...... that show makes you want to point the finger at something and make it disappear I mean it's just so creative and I like that I'd like to be in that show .. . .... that show is just amazing, I want to say who invented that show I just want to give them a big kiss, I mean it makes me feel better when I'm sick and it makes me happy when I'm crazy I mean if someone tells me that I don't he likes, I'll talk a little bit about you OK OK
