*** SPOILERS *** When under cover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano, was to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section in Brooklyn in a buying and selling operation, with Tito being caught, that things went haywire with both Det. Santos and Tito end up getting shot and killed by each other. During the deadly shooting, an innocent third-year James Bone Jr. of six, Jaliyl Lynn, was also killed in the crossfire. <br /> <br /> With New York City scheduled to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer the last thing that the flamboyant Mayor Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible revolt against James' tragic young death Bones was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed the young James, a member of New York City Police Department. <br /> <br /> What was even more shocking then even Bone's death is that his murderer Tito Zapatti was released by the New York County judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 or 20 years he was arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the back seat of his car! It soon became apparent that the person who had obtained his job from Judge Stern, for a fee of $ 50,000.00, was not Brooklyn's political leader, Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It is Anselmo who is involved with mayor Pappas in a land deal, involving the New York subway system, which would bring him and his real estate friends to tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly link mayor Pappas in the Bone murder by linking it to Judge Stern, which made it possible for Tito to be free, who is a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo! <br /> <br /> To prevent all this from blowing up the deceased Det. Santons is framed, working undercover without the permission of his superiors, in the bone shooting. In fact those who frame Santos go up and hide about $ 40,000.00 in cash at his northern summer residence, making him look paid by his uncle Maito, Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew take drugs with him getting a piece of the action. Which could explain, in addition to Tito, getting shot by Tito around on his paid Santos! <br /> <br /> On balance, it is Mayor Pappas' deputy at City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up ruining everything for his boss by being too honest to find out who was responsible in covering Tito's criminal past that allowed him to be out on the streets. The facts discovered by Kevin lead directly to Frank Anselmo, an important political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who turned out to be bound by the head of Tito's mafia, Uncle Paul! <br /> <br /> A little overcrowded "The Town Hall" shows how the great corruption of the city can filter, besides down, to anyone in the municipal government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing it. The greatest sin of Mayor Pappas was that he was a friend of Brooklyn boss Anselmo, who was putting people in jobs, like Judge Stern, who had been blackmailed by Anselmo's real boss, Mafioso Paul Zapatti. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** It took only a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to put everything in motion not only from Tito, in addition to Det. Santos and James Bone, who were killed but because they were allowed to go out on the street to bring down the infamous New York City mayor. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like the governor or the president, in his future political activities. As it turned out his deputy principal Kevin Calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his disappearance. As well as that of the good friend of Mayor Frank Anselmo and the person who helped judge Judge Stern as a state judge. Whoever decided to leave Tito Zapatti did all this disaster, which caused at least half a dozen murders and suicide, possible!
