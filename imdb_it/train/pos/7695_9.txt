Good Times was a revolutionary comedy about the first nuclear black family that lived in Chicago projects. Regardless of whether you live in inner cities, ghettos, suburbs or countryside, this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a spectacle of a poor black family. But do not dwell on this. They find humor and have strong family and moral values. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth watching, except I didn't like them killing their father, which was in agreement with Esther Rolle who fought hard to keep the family together. But despite all the fighting behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about a family. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics. We've seen Janet Jackson's Penny grow a little. This show was revolutionary to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being preaching, the Evans have always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
