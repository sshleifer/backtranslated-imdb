Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher movies. The scenes of death are elaborate and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton was a great female protagonist (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the movies "I Know ..."). David Boreanaz, which is the main reason I saw this film, played a rather small role, but he played it well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. It was horrible in this. The only scene I was glad to see was * SPOILER * on the scene of death. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch it before watching "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
