i love this movie the songs and plots are very funny. and the song "say goodbye" always moves me. what a brilliant thing to do to make puppets live, in a way that really interests you about these things made of fabric and fabric and so on. great voices and great talent. why are all the other muppet films that came after this much less interesting, moving and fun? Is that Mr. Henson so badly missed?
