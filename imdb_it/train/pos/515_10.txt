I remember the first time I saw this movie: I was in the office working during the weekend and the TV was on due to the background noise. But gradually I found myself getting more and more involved in this film that I had never seen or heard, until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the United States) is delightful, compelling, capricious and moving, all in a superbly written, well acted and perfectly direct package. It's a classic that ranks right up there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. WHY never received the same public notice and the prominence of the video studio? Fortunately, some expert critics have included in their lists "Top 100 of all time". There is hope: Fantasy of 1940 was not a success until the 1960s, and the Wizard of Oz was a box office disaster, but was hit by TV. Buy it - rent it - look at it - ask it back! You will NOT be disappointed!
