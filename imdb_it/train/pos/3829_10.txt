In this glorious tale of a weekend shared among the greats of literature. Mary and Percy Shelly, Lord Byron and others have created an entrancing group. Showing their research for sexual enlightenment. Personal freedoms from political to moral ones. Use of liberal drugs for both stimulation and addiction. Their creative ideas about life and writing. Describing the viewer without boring as any writer tries to find his own muse. Together with distractions and affections every sharing. With a breathtaking scenery that does not diminish but greatly improves the story. Well created characters from sad to love then angry with peaceful. With some of the most beautiful and spectacular costumes to have.
