I really like this movie ... when I started watching it I thought I would get bored very soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a fantastic movie and I saw it several times. The characters are believable and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (the first time is Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan, but I agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is a bit disappointing. I would have liked it to be a little different! However, it doesn't matter, a good compelling story.
