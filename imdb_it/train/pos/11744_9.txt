"Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle" is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> While we can predict that his titular girlfriend, the up-up teacher will have some sort of killing or catharsis based on some secret background of his past, as his emotions are revealed is surprising. The range of feelings transmitted by Spall is quite moving and more than I can interpret as part of Mike Leigh's repertoire. <br /> <br /> While a boring school bus trip was used only for comic purposes, such as "The Simpsons", this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in the Rhidian Brook script is well structured and structured for dramatic purposes, and is almost formally divided into acts. <br /> <br /> We have introduced the British urban range of children variously racially and religiously (with their uniforms I could not say if this is a "private" or "public" school), how do they gather? the black guys rap, the serious Asians and Muslims of the south, the white bullies and the bad girls ?? but transmitted in a completely natural and individual way. The young actors, some of whom I recognized from British TV as "Shameless", were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior social pressures. Celia Imrie puts more heat into the supervisor role than the jacks she usually has to play. <br /> <br /> A break in the journey leads to a transformation crisis for some, while others remain pleasantly forgotten. We think, like the teacher interpreted by Ben Miles of "Coupling", that we will be given a teaching lesson on religious tolerance, but it is much more about faith in people as well as in God, which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter and BBC America showed it in the United States for Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good at "Summer of Love", has a key role in the redemption of Mr. Harvey that could have been played for the preaching of the movie of the week, but it is moving when they touch each other in unexpected ways (unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by advertisements). <br /> <br /> Even if it is a bit heavy handed on several occasions, defining this traveling journey "a pilgrimage", this peaceful film was the best evocation of "goodwill towards men" than it has seen in many holiday-themed TV movies.
