The usual cat and mouse antics abound until Jerry jumps into an invisible ink bottle. He has the brilliant idea of ​​torturing Tom without his knowing it. The cat becomes wise and tries to do things to make it "see" jerry even if it is not infallible. Obviously Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike the dog in place (although he's late in the short, and his contribution is really minimal) Brilliant short animated that reminds me of the one with the white mouse that scares Tom so badly. Most gags work and are as violent as good tom and jerry short should be. This funny cartoon can be found on disc one of the DVDs of the "Tom & Jerry" Spotlight collection <br /> <br /> My Grade: B +
