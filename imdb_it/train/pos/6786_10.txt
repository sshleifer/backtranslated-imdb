Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance like Tony John, a Broadway actor who can't separate his life offstage from Shakespeare's Othello, the character who performs on stage ... Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first takes place in the office of the producer Max Lasker. Acting is a matter of talent for the practical Lasker. But Donlan, Tony's friend, disagrees: "No, no. When you do it like Tony, it's much more. The way he has to become someone else every night ... so completely. No, don't tell me its whole system is not affected. "... The other scene occurs in Pat Kroll's apartment. Tony tells her that his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says: "O Paul, Hamlet, Joe, and maybe Othello." ... When Tony starts to try Othello, we learn that, although he is trying to keep his real life separate from his theatrical life, "The part begins to seep into your life and the battle begins, the reality against the imagination." He can't keep the two separated: in his mind, Pat is Desdemona and he is Othello, and he mistakenly believes he is unfaithful to him. He kills her ... Colman's skill, in a complex and difficult role, earned him the 1947 Oscar for Best Actor. The Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin as best original screenplay. Do not overlook the atomic cinematography of Milton Krasner.
