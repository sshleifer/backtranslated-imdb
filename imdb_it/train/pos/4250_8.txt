Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third short film, the most complete, has an unusual sense of humor and will leave some scratches on his head. What it is about in the film, and almost certainly wouldn't agree with me on this, it's like a normal Joe finds the confidence to overcome life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short is making intermittent turns on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes open and take it if you can - you'll be glad you did. It is funny. And take a look at Todd's other short films that pop up here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
