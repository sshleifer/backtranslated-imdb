If this were an American film I'd classify it 7: we've already seen it before. Being this an Argentine film, and being an Argentine myself, I'd like to give it a 10, since it's the kind of quality I was hoping for - rather than expecting - for. Its superb quality is surprising, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd World ... <br /> <br /> I cannot forget the scene in which Díaz forces Silverstein's boyfriend to confess: you know what I mean if you've seen the movie. I think it's the key moment of the film, perhaps not surprising, but original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie I always try to gather some previous information. Being this a mainstream, satirical, commercial, I press "Play" and I suspend reality and logic, I would say the best mood to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, yet it is credible in a certain way. As far as I'm concerned, I couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and comment - "sos malo" ("you're bad") ... put in the mouth Díaz, the oldest. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty tired of seeing movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he is an exceptional actor, but sometimes I feel his roles unfairly opaque for the rest, the role of Luis Luque in this case. I don't really like Argentinian television, so I haven't seen much of Luque's work, but it's pretty obvious he's an excellent artist. His physical role, his looks, his attitude to the content in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should need an update, just to show him how fantastic it can be! <br /> <br /> I don't know if Szifrón is planning a sequel or not. I know he will not make it if he has to follow the rule that "the second parts have never been good", so if he will succeed, I will definitely go to see him. And I hope that, in the future, it will take into account the possibility of giving Peretti's counterparts the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great shows and lots of laughs!
