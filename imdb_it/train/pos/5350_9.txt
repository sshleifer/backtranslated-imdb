I've seen The Running Man several times, I'm a Stephen King fan and I have all his movies, but now it's even better because up until 2 days ago I didn't know this site and I didn't realize that Paul Michael Glaser was involved in this film it was Paul Michael Glaser himself who grew up watching the Starsky and Hutch TV show. For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, I cried so hard that my father had to leave the show. What do you expect from a 12 year old child? Now, I intentionally look for films and programs that involve Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on. I'm so there !!!!!!!! I just have to say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
