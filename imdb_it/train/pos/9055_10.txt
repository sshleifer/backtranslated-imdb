This is a fantastic film and all the actors and actresses are very good! Although some actors and actresses weren't very famous in the entertainment world, they seemed to be acting since they were 1 year old! It was fun, vulgar and just a great movie. In most cases I didn't know what would happen next! I was like I thought this would happen, I wait, I think it will happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I couldn't stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally disgusted and couldn't believe what I was seeing! I'll definitely see this movie again! It's one of those movies where it can't get boring. Every time you see it, it's so full of suspense. I highly recommend seeing this movie !!
