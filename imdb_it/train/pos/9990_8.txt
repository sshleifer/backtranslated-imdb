I saw the movie recently and loved it. I was surprised and I cried. This film is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but manages the whole theme of aging with incredible authenticity. It's really hard to have the main character as unlikely as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is difficult to understand. His world has sharp edges and is not at all a hot and captivating woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene succeeds without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. He understands it en route and freaks out. Its edges are really hard. She is mean. It is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like it - not even a little. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we get insights. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, because she prefers one child to another, how her losses formed her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like it. I particularly liked it when he poured his secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "feeling good" film, but it is certainly a film that brings the observer to empathy. I understand more clearly that the boundaries of a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother - read or close ... but some parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've seen The Stone Angel.
