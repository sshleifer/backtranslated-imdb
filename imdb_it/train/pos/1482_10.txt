The best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for the couples who will come in the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and the family. This decision could be the best or the worst in our lives and in our children's lives. The real intrusion or help of "friends" - or executor if we leave -. The true role of families: they can help or can destroy us. The crazy priest who is perhaps not very crazy to tell what could happen according to statistics and reality. A couple that thinks in a "special" marriage, lives a painful story in their future history. <br /> <br /> Who likes contract marriage? No one, after the priest tells his story? if they leave the future in another hand, if they don't know WHAT is marriage. That the problems are true, that life requires a real commitment, guarantees, on the part of everyone. That the real victims of divorce are children, with the real name ?? Andrea in the film - or names. That abortion is just an easy way out: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after the abortion. That the state and social security think less every time in a real family problem. The gossip of "friends", infidelity due to the weakness and despair of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someone might think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the depths of their hearts, they like a beautiful wedding and a family, if not, why do they like marriage? A truly beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: on each of their decisions, on each of the actions in their lives. The family could be a place where everyone feels loved because it is his, only existing. The script is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, the almost cynical priest! Excellent direction and script. The colors and the management of the cameras, superb.
