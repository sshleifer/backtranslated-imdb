Harvey Keital's best performance so far in the new century. Very well photographed, a beautiful snapshot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the grandson of a local crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood ties. It is precisely the moment when a boy wakes up to the fact that the small circle of people he knows lives in a much larger and much more complex world that he has not yet understood. The script is strong and full of humor, the direction is crunchy Overall, a really professional job that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to run in synchronous English rather than Spanish, probably to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see further, you'll find a sincere journey to another world. Recommended.
