Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor in life. Aristocratic English snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent and violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot (just to name a few). His roles influence each other, but each is separate and absolutely unique. Change completely, with each character he takes on. And I'm starting to believe that he can act like anything. Everything. <br /> <br /> How Cristy Brown is stunning. He does not ridicule the character, and has no pity on the character. A difficult result. And Cristy Brown comes to life. An intelligent man. An outrageous man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film, despite the minor errors of stage transition and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Show that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the restaurant scene, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. That's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. "I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "Bring out the cripple!" And his performance never slows down, never falters and is beautiful. Simply. It has a lot of time on the screen here. I look at him again, and I never get tired of Cristy's insightful eyes, spasmodic and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. Fo sho, yo!
