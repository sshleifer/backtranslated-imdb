Coming as a sort of pre-runner to The Great Escape some 13 years later, this small destructive British movie sounds straight without shuddering and challenging a lot. The first part of the film is the installation and subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while they are fleeing while trying to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure characters with a simple, effective and yes, credible dialogue to carry it forward, and achieves its goals handsomely. No small dose of suspense keeps the pace of the film, and how an adventure story works perfectly for the time it adheres to, so a big thumb to the film that could be the first of its kind? <br /> 7/10
