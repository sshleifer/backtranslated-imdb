The case of the Scorpion's tail is a very elegant yellow directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a yellow master second only to Dario Argento. Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous man-dunnit, rather complex but in the end a very satisfying and amusing murder mystery. It also makes sense, in the end, a big advantage, because it is not always the case with these crime books, as they tend to extend credibility with their endless red-aring and final solutions. Here, the less you know the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The Pure Yellow brands featured here are the beautiful photograph, the captivating soundtrack, the beautiful bitches (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), the brutal murders, black gloved assassins and explicit sex scenes to name a few . <br /> <br /> In most cases it is played decently, Goerge Hilton, his usual car usually and others do quite well. Martino directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some fantastic set pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a yellow fan, this is a must see. If you like thrillers that are well written and suspense in general, this is highly recommended.
