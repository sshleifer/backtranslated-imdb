8 simple rules to get to know my teenage daughter had an auspicious start. Tom Shadyac, the supremely talented, was involved in the project. This meant that the play would not be less spectacular, and that is exactly what happened: the show remains one of the freshest, funniest and most spirited shows ever since. Every line, facial expression, casting choice, scene, everything to perfection. There was no episode after which I thought, "The man was not as good as the rest". Everyone was a standout. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism that is expected of Tom. For the uninitiated, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first film), The Mad Professor (the first) and Liar Liar. A real summary. He is a producer here not a director, but his magic touch is felt in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> The Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): likeable, slightly neurotic, he can be a pushover from time to time, he works as a sports writer. Unfortunately, John disappeared in 2003, leaving a fond memory and almost safe cancellation contemplations from the seeds. <br /> <br /> The Mother: Cate (Katey Sagal): come on, who hasn't fallen in love with Katey when he played Peg in Married With Children? Al Bundy was our hero. We spectators gave him the respect and love he never had. But without Peg's indifferent, parasitic and lazy lifestyle, Al would probably have been just another Chicago daddy instead of the mess that Peg (life actually) had caused him. Katey was a MILF then and still is: a brune now (instead of a red one) and just as prosperous as ever. Cate is the conservative mom and loving wife. I know it sounds boring, but comically, it fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection by Kaley Cuoco): almost never an idiot has been played so well. Beyond Gob in Arrested Development, Bridget could be a reference point for any award given to this archetype. Bridget is superficial, self-centered, not very bright and a little slutty in her appearance. She plays the silly role of the blonde better than any other IMO. Perfection. One of the highlights of the show. <br /> <br /> The Overlooked Geeky Daughter: Kerry (Amy Davidson): a brune and a geek, she doesn't get love from life or circumstances. He feels neglected, undervalued and neglected most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (she is actually older than her) and the two extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes, much of our fun. <br /> <br /> The Son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): it was the second funniest IMO character before Ritter's death, then John passes, new characters arrive and Rory is not the creator of verbal-trouble problems puzzle that he used to do: he was above all the character of David Spade. <br /> <br /> Those characters were the main ones at the time of John Ritter. Unfortunately, the insanely hilarious Larry Miller (one of my favorites) didn't have much screen time. He played Paul's collaborator. After an aortic dissection that killed Ritter in 2003 (September 11), the show was paused for a while. No one thought he could come back, but he did it later, with a couple of new additions. This started the second phase of the show, and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> The school principal, rigorous and confident: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there on the talk show. This was the first time I saw him do something. Impressed, it's the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Sad, it was not brought before. He also interprets Cate's potential love interest after Paul passed. The gradual progress towards this point (which at the beginning would have seemed crazy) earned the creators much praise. It was done slowly, carefully and excellently, with constant respect for Paul (Ritter). The Attitude Grandpa: Jim Egan (James Garner): a surprisingly welcome addition to the series, it was a forage cannon for endless "old" jokes, mainly from ... <br /> <br /> The 35-year-old unemployed, Mom's wise half-brother: CJ (played incredibly funny by David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I just didn't know it was so funny. Somehow, the very familiar presence of Spade is perceived within his character (as opposed to a separable character), which is understandable, since he is a comedian and is part of a comedy show. This strange feeling is like seeing someone borrow a lot of material from David Spade's appearances in films, talk shows and functions (awards, etc.) and offer a superb imitation of Spade's voice and comic style, except that it's Spade. By that I mean that you understand that he is not trying to play someone else, or a completely new character: he is the stupid, funny Swords we have come to know, and brings this formula pleasantly fun to the absolute top. Every sentence he uttered, every sarcasm he generated, all the classics, literally. Spade was CRAZY-fun; so, SO fun. <br /> <br /> The show's humor and drama were increased after the show returned, but the audience thought, "John has passed, he will never be the same". This is understandable, considering that we are talking about a group of people (the American spectators) who gave "Yes Dear" a free ride, but caused the cancellation of Andy Richter Controls the Universe in no time. As the quality of the show increases, its ratings have decreased. Soon it was gone, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> And I saved the best for last: Married With Children fans have a surprise. And boy, how wonderful it was. I still shudder to remember it. It's such a beautiful surprise that it would be crazy for me to ruin it, even if I do it legitimately under the pretext "spoiler ...". Suffice it to say that it is something I will never forget. I know I won't do it :-)
