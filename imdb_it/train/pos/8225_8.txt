Strangely, all the previous comments have only described the beginning and left the details. I feel the need to confirm that this is a family work, since Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and the excellent jazz was written by your director's father, Andr√©. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that it was a good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with music. The suspense was flawless, and maintained until the end. Robert Hossein, one of the best European players at the time, also managed to establish himself as a top screen and stage manager. He is still exhibiting great theatrical performances, with a preference for religious subjects. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
