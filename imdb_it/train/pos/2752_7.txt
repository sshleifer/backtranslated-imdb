Although the plot elements of "The Eighth Day" seem to have been made many times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery and symbolism of Jaco Van Dormal's first film. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain on my list of favorites, the film still leaves us with many emotions. Daniel Auteil, from the taste without taste of "The Closet" of 2001 minimizes his part, afraid of exaggerating (rightly, the role could be easily ruined if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt that the part needed a little more realism, focusing more on the character itself rather than on the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not enter this film expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists and turns that you got from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film is still a decent film, if not imperfect
