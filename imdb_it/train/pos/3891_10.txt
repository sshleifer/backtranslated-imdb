One of the best comedies ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and I'll probably watch at least another 100. My friends and my family often quote this DVD, you'd think we've done nothing but watch it. The initial part of Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either cross it or go through the part where Eddie is on stage. Look at the "Cake or Death" part (joking about the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" part (hard to explain, just watch it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help, eh?) Right notice: Eddie has a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words.
