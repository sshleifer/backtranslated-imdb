I appreciated the photography, the textures, the colors and often, unlike a comment, lighting. What I missed was a coherent plot. I found it often bumpy, poorly written and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Maybe the cuts and subtitles didn't help. I appreciate all the movies that escape the Hollywood mold, but this left me disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
