The film looked like a passage for "Immoral Study". Most probably I have never been very involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize the male nudes and therefore all that noise about "Now, who designed this penis ?!" seemed a little free. The dialogues in this film are rather terrible, although visually this film has its moments. I almost dug when Tassi started painting a mental image, but then the film returned to penises. Highly recommended for those who have not seen one every now and then.
