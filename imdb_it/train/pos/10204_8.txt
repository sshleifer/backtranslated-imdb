Although it's not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I liked Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read the comic book and saw it in the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was OK, I understood the meaning of the 80s anime which is what gave me the best. Because everyone else hates that it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> The development of the character was fine. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around. for you who doesn't like it, obviously he wasn't paying attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens, and he used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a good mentor / soldier for her. his dark bruiting style was perfect for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I think everyone here who fought this need to take another look at it and reconsider. because all that people have hit this can be said about all the favorite souls of Vampire Hunter D
