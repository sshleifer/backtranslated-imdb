I saw it 25 years ago on PBS. It was very difficult to watch. So true. Seeing this little family fight in the winter has been heartbreaking. There is no time to woo: destiny has thrown us together and we have put our backs to the boulder and make it work. This was based on the woman's current journal, which I read many years later. He said in his diary that his parents died when he was little and all of their brothers and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. He learned to mow, which was not a lady. He feared that no prince would want a woman with calloused and tanned hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to cut, and she was happy to do it. Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. He was so, so sad when the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been fine. This makes the tragedy even sadder. I was crying so hard. But then they left and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is coming and life goes on. In her diary, she had two other boys and lived.
