I own the forgotten masterpiece by Ralph Bakshis, Fire & Ice, on an old OOP rental video cassette. Well, first of all, it's better than any other Conan movie you've ever seen. Sure, it's poor, but who cares? It has stood the test of time, and the only way it started to look bad is compared to modern epic fantasy games like LOTR: FOTR (although I love that movie.) <br /> <br /> The plot is so : After a battle between Fire & Ice, a king's daughter is kidnapped by subhuman creatures of Jarols (Ice), while a single survivor of a victimized village rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yes, it doesn't look as original as Nurse Betty, but that's not the point. It is really to give life to an interesting idea of ​​a world of two enemies: Fire and ice. And it happens. <br /> <br /> Regarding the action scenes: superb. They are well managed, have a terrifying suspense and have a lot of loud noises. Just take a look at the climate battle, now THAT IT'S an ending! <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue: competent. Really. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are OK and do not get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good. Shot in 3D and rotoscopato (PENSO), it looks pretty good. Many of the backgrounds look really detailed and well designed, and even if the character designs look a little three-dimensional, they are OK. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a small neglected gem and will entertain you more than any "entertainment" surface. 10/10
