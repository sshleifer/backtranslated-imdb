I've always liked Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very mundane, mediocre in certain areas and certainly, even if they are aimed at small children, they are too grown-up in some fields to be able to protect them with the phrase, "Hey, reduce, it's a movie children ", but apart from that, aren't they still good entertainment pieces? I think they are like that and I like them a lot. This is just as enjoyable as the previous three and certainly nicer. It has really sweet and touching moments because it is the introduction of the lovely, fresh Pok√©mon Celebi. It is not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy more than the third chapter, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is fun, harmless, fun for the popcorn family and should not be considered anything more, nothing less . This film has a high score of intensity and interest, especially around the climax / ending, as well as all the bets and characters, while a little more dull than the previous three, I thought, are still nice and funny. This film is the most voted and the most criticized of the four adaptations of the feature length, and does not deserve it.
