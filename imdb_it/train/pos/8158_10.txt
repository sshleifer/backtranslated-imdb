"Fear Of A Black Hat" is all that (much weaker) "CB-4" SHOULD have been. The satirical eye of Rusty Cundieff is ruthless, while he bends, breathes and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. "FoaBH" looks like Spinal Tap? Yes a bit. Comes from Spinal Tap? No, not really. The goal is more focused, satire is more focused and, to be honest, it's more fun.
