I remember having a rather low consideration for a company like this when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a child and youth actress, and a cheese title in a John Hughes formula. You couldn't have paid me to see him 15 years ago. But I was surprised as I watched him waste a Sunday afternoon and hit me on a couple of levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, reverse part Pretty Woman), the vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street - like Kelly Lynch's performance, the escape. Above all, gently pull some very nice strings. It's hard enough not to get into the story, develop a crush on Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike the bad boyfriend, and laugh at the lines of Curley Sue. It has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time with this movie, it's worth it.
