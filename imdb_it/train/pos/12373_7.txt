Time has not been kind to this film. The only controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, this film now looks like a simple mainstream version of your typical spookfest. Horrible touches aside (especially the crazy one in the upper end), this is essentially a glossy horror film for those people who don't really care about the genre. He has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast to convince the public that this is not your movie medium-low (the producers of films of disasters of the '70s had a similar idea). I liked seeing familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter how the movie pretends to be high-class, it works at the level of your exploitative movie of the 70s (not a bad thing, though ). Still, it's a fun movie, especially for those viewers who like to watch the stars. As usual, Albert Whitlock's dull work is exceptional. Overall, quite fun.
