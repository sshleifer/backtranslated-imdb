Many speeches have been made about "psychological westerns", but this is one of the very few that is really in that genre. He has great stars of the name who perform very well, but he is the director who makes this film so beautiful. Stewart Granger loses his stereotype of a British safari hunter to play a haunted retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the upstart (in contrast to the usual young upstart, the character of Taylor is middle-aged, too), who wants to butcher the buffalo and attracts Granger in business with him. They take on two other big names, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, like their skinners. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing that it could be to blame if they die out, knowing if they die out, the Native American lifestyle will suffer a lot. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic saying, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of the modern film, created by nerds and big dicks. He is insecure and needs human companionship. However, it will not stop at murder. The end puts the two against each other, with a surprising conclusion. The psychological effects of what they are doing are well represented.
