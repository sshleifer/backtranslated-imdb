A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine and a formidable supporting cast directed by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> Typically silly conspiracy for an Astaire movie like an American dance star in England with Burns as his press officer and Allen his secretary. They build a story about his being a love bug with women who fall victim to him on the right and left. He runs into Fontaine who is held captive in his castle by a bully aunt and a docile father. Stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Great songs include A Foggy Day, Things are looking up, Good work if you can get it, and I can't be bothered now. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a brief (and dignified) number with Astaire. Surprisingly well in some dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including a fun and entertaining game in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> The cast also includes Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the main madrigal singer. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio singing Nice Work if You Can Get It. His facial expressions are hilarious. He was also a stage stealer in W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, which plays Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> Many abuses have been caught in this film due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been horribly mixed. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes. Two other potential disasters. Fontaine is as good as Alyce and the dynamics allow the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with a wide comic relief of Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Funny movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!
