It was a bit weird and evil and I liked it a lot, even the characters on the show were fantastic, and they complimented each other well. I was sorry to see him cut ... I would have liked to have seen where he could have gone. You found Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was scary and seductive. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character has become. Anyway, I'll buy the show just for fun, it was great for something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin, was a great mystery about where and what he meant by Lucas. It is a pity that it is not yet in circulation ... or that it never ended, I would have liked to see what would have happened.
