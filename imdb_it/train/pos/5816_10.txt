The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dancing. Having grown up, I also became more interested in acting. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 to the "Bad"), it was still fun to watch. The "Badder" sequence could have been omitted, although the children were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were fun, especially when the police officer told Michael: "I need your autograph right here", after stopping it to dance in an area without dancing. But it is "Smooth Criminal" which is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as a tough guy (and that hair was wild). The dance is perfect, as are the special effects. The only thing I could have done without was the spiders. Any Michael fan should see it if you haven't already. I give him a 10+!
