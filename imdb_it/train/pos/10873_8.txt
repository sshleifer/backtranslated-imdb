This film really deserves more recognition than it gets. It is truly an amazing representation and rich in blood ties, favors and loyalty in the world of crime. The film is shot beautifully and explores all the classic themes of crime such as treason and power. This film is a movie film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end. He is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change rather than another fight of wires, an epic martial arts that seems to be the biggest contribution to the world of cinema from Hong Kong and China. It is characterized by an arrangement of great characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to watch it twice only to nail down what was happening with some of the characters due to their number of interactions in the film. ALl in all 8/10 Great characters in the plot, but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really help me and sometimes I felt that it didn't synchronize well with the action (there's action on the part of the way ) so it loses some points for that.
