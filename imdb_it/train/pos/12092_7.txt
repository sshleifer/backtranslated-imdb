I remember for the first time having seen it in the 70s when it was shown on television late at night. You scared the shit out of me. But then, I was a teenager in those days, not as tired of movies as they are now. <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a fine example of the Italian horror genre of the 60s, along with BLACK SUNDAY by Mario Bava (1960), CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and CASTELLO NIGHTMARE by Mario Caiano (1965). If you want a spooky atmosphere and good writing, check these too. I also consider them along with those early Poe films that Roger Corman was doing at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken by a French press and it is a big improvement over that old-and-scan pan that was doing the TV tour over the years . He adds a couple of minutes of dialogue (in French) that don't add much to the film as a whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. Unfortunately the DVD doesn't really offer any extras beyond the photos from the movie. <br /> <br /> A flub that I noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the man with smoke effects next to the camera reflected on the glass of the inn's front door. I guess the editors didn't catch it at the time, or maybe they didn't care, but it's something I didn't notice the first time. This is the wonder of the DVD. You can see all the flubs, errors and details that were not evident the first time. But it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't matter, he still gets a 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
