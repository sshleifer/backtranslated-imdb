First of all, don't go into Revolver waiting for another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala the other night and this film has definitely divided the audience. It's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave to think WHAT was it? It was horrible, and the other half will leave to think. WHAT was it? This was nice. I personally like films I don't understand, namely Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, so I liked Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was definitely not perfect. I have seen the big breakthrough to reach a mile away, at least in part, and although sometimes some free parts left unexplained are good, Revolver leaves MANY unexplained questions for no reason. Even some scenes, like the animation, and the scene in which Sorter goes wild with a murderous madness (actually one of my favorites), even though, wonderful scenes to watch, seemed to be there just because they were fantastic to watch, not because fit in with the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there were also many good things. I thought the acting was superb by all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This film has certainly kept my interest, with a great scene, full of suspense, full of action, one behind the other. When Ray Liotta was under the table wow .... well, you have to see it. The script was extremely well done and the soundtrack, like most of Guy Ritchie's films, was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although one step under films like Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still a fantastic action, psychological and action movie, with many twists and tons of scenes that you will remember long after the film ended.
