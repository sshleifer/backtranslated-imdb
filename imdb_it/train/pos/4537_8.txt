I saw the film for the first time at the BBC on July 27th 2005. For me it was a good performance by the person Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what Sherlock fans think of it. I also think it's a movie for these fans whether they agree or disagree what is mentioned. You could ask yourself to be A.C. Doyle is a strong person or has been questioned. However he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of it was a sort of semi-biography? Nevertheless I strongly apply this adaptation, it is a film that you must see - even if you are not interested in Sherlock Holmes films or books - watch a movie, have fun and have your opinion on it.
