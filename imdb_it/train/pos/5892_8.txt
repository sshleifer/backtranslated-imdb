Thomas Ince has always had the ability to create simple home stories with fullness and talent. "L'italiano" is a film of the genre. The solid acting, in particular that of George Beban, father of the silent child actor George Beban, Jr., and the marvelous sets convey a realistic feeling of the first houses of immigrants in New York. These give this 1915 film an authenticity that is unusual in the characteristics of this vintage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) who reads a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we go down in history with George who plays the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his girlfriend from Italy to America, the bride and he has a child with her. But times are difficult and the family struggles to survive. I found myself wondering why her mother wasn't breastfeeding her baby and avoiding complications with the dirty formula, but oh, well, even the first dream factory was pushing correct political behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has the chance to take revenge on a criminal boss who inadvertently put him in prison, and at the last minute decides against his planned course of action. Very clean. I loved the curtain effect, it was fantastic. Wonderful use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give "The Italian" to 8 out of 10.
