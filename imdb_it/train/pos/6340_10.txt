First an explanation of what makes a great film for me. The excitement of not knowing what comes next will make me enjoy a movie the first time I watch it (case in point: Twister). There are also other things that go into a great vision like good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative narrative (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas is THE MAN), and good music (still all the episodes of Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. That said, I introduce Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, in particular Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every single scene with Cindy and The Grinch - together is excellent and very funny and / or moving. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this film and the most convincing reason why the film is better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can't start because I don't want to ruin it). Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch, particularly when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Great music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and compositions. Great job Jim Carrey: I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. On your solo - Where Are You Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? Does it look like an F #? This is an obscene range for a 7 year old (obscene meant the best possible way). Good job. This is the best interpretation of a child I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor beat the Von Trapp Children - it's not a small undertaking!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and, surprisingly, very sensitive (this really showed in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). The unspoken expressions of Taylor Momsen (one of the secrets of good acting) are very strong - she really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when he talks he is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** Danger: spoiler alarm ******** ************* *************************** ********** ********************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when he sees for the first time The Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You are the the" and then compiled with the Grinch line "from da THE GRINCH", after which it overturns into the selector and is then saved by The Grinch). me "and The Grinch's subsequent response was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. This scene is made up of two excellent actors who interact And expressing to each other Little Taylor Momsen is completely in his place with Jim Carrey in this place, I sincerely hope we will see Taylor Momsen in many other films to come. feet and nose).
