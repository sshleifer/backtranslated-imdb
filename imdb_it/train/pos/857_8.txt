Greetings still from the darkness. The much awaited and astonished comedy of writer / director Richard Shepard is an upcoming party for Pierce Brosnan's actor. That Bond boy is gone. This new guy is something else entirely !! I read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too cute for this plum role, but Brosnan turns out to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and he's anything but cute! Don't underestimate how much humor is twisted in this. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags covering all types of sex, murder, religion, sports, business and anything else that you might find politically incorrect. Brosnan brings an excellent script to another level with his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is also a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the straight guy from Brosnan's comic book and has a lot of depth and comic timing to click on this partnership. Hope Davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear's wife (what's her "Bean"?) That gets excited when she has a facilitator in her living room. <br /> <br /> the images and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, a runway and a Denver suburb. And how often do we receive The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a little off center and you enjoy filming risks, it could be for you.
