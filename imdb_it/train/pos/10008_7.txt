You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, he's constantly shooting his feet lately with all those stupid comedies he did in this decade (with perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy", which he bombed when he came out, but now it's a cult classic). The dramas he has recently made have been fantastic, in particular "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener", despite the mediocre reviews and a quick DVD version, is among his best works, period. <br /> <br /> This is a very chilling story, even if it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on a real case of fraud that has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read online reports that Johnson might not actually exist. When I saw this film, the confused feelings that Robin Williams has so brilliantly portrayed have re-emerged in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably also offers his best dramatic performance as a "guardian", ultimately sociopathic. His role was very different from those he had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There have even been times when he looked into the camera where I thought he was staring at me. It takes a good actress to play this kind of role, and it is this role that is underestimated (but well reviewed) that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation to have not even been nominated for an Academy Award (since 2008). It is incredible that there is at least one woman in the world that is so, and it is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good dark movie that I highly recommend. Prepare to be uncertain, though, because this film leaves you feeling strange at the end.
