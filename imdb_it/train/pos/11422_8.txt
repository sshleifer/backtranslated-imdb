Claire Denis' Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the family of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, offering the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often exaggeratedly insufficient. For example, a central theme in history is the inability of young France to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrait is impeccably executed, particularly in the way Denis frames the story with scenes of France's return to his childhood home, the girl's lack of intimacy with the other characters in the film makes it difficult for a viewer to much in its development (or lack of it) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the development of the character of the film makes it difficult to engage in the freely organized plot. The film raises a great tension between the characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in his life, but he never completely addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer dissatisfied. The last scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a movie with adventures or dramas, Chocolat is certainly not the best choice.
