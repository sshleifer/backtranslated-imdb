Listen, I don't care what anyone says, since Cypher is nothing more than a 5-star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, a B series movie. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say that I am a connoisseur of the most beautiful espionage films in the world and this film is no less than the maximum. I can't emphasize how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best espionage films ever conceived and never made. The technology in this film is beyond the space-time horizon. In fact, I must admit that Cypher completely surprised me. In fact, I recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom have downplayed the film, have no idea what the hell they're talking about. Don't listen to haters. And actually, for the most part, Cypher's reviews have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not just a good movie, but it is also a fantastic film. Cypher is the kind of film so advanced and beautifully crafted, that it is above the heads of most critics and all cynics. There is nothing wrong or cheap about Cypher. Once again, the cinematography, the backdrops, the technology, the plot and the acting are all top notch at 100% worldwide level. Of course, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And although it is the thesis of some critics that Cypher should have been in theaters, I rather believe the opposite. Cypher is a film that seems to have been right only for the DVD version and not in a negative way. Cypher has become the largest underground spy film ever achieved on the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... watch out! Cypher also gains the difference of being included in the AONN Multimedia Research, 5-star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is counter-espionage at its absolute best. Hands down and hat down. Nothing is what it seems and the truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.
