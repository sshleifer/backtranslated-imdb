I saw this movie at a time when I played shyly with the idea of ​​moving into my apartment and starting my life alone. Maybe that's why I took him so seriously. I totally believed in the psychological degradation of the poor character within a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decadence. I am giving all credit to Polanski's artistry in his direction, his way of playing and his inevitable script, but I fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the theater director's office. Fortunately for me, my life alone has not been so disastrous (so far), but I have always maintained great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and immerse himself totally in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. In short, man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This film is the sum of many, many examples of great acting and great casting. Since some performances were done in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most of the other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I strongly recommend , if you happen to be bilingual, to switch audio from French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "condominium trilogy" which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet moved to a discreet transfer of DVDs to the region 1. Needless to say, the three films would represent a magnificent box set.
