One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. And the next day we were at the Hollywood Blvd. supermarket and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who was coming towards us in the hallway! Barney Phillips, but without a hat - at least, I don't think he had a hat on. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye, and he said something as if he had left it at home, and everyone he met that day asked him about this. <br /> <br /> A friendly boy. In those days we saw all kinds of character actors in LA. <br /> <br /> BTW, I was a teenager and it took me a long time to get over the "three hands" of the other alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> native and resident Hollywood from 1947 to 1963.
