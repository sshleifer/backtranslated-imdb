Although I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I read my part, so I guess I'm part of the audience for this movie, and I wasn't disappointed. It's almost out of gas towards the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the floor of the editing room. Also, a bit of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can do a lot. Still, it's easy to forgive all these flaws when you have a movie that is a lot of fun. All the actors seem to have fun with their roles, in particular William H. Macy as Shoveler with the straight arrow and Janeane Garofalo with the role of Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even more fun. I also liked how disco music was the choice of villains; somehow, it seemed appropriate.
