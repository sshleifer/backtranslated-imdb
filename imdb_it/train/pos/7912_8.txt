These things have been on my mind for almost ten years. Some pieces of this work were truly memorable. - I'd like to see another more current example of cg flashy stuff. Actually I'd like to be part of it. <br /> <br /> If I had the chance to just say what I wanted and that's all, I wouldn't have to write all this in order to do "10 lines if the text" as this site requires. Do I really mean it? This almost discourages me, I luckily say for the guys who made the film I really liked Minds Eye - and it took me 3 times to get enough lines, I hope they don't make me spelling mistakes. - yes, you did.
