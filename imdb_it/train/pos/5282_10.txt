I don't know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious actions (hajj) but I just heard that the film is so undervalued. I can't believe that the film has just been voted by only 223 people since the film was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since then. On the film ... it is one of those well recited films.Reda, a French teenager who sits down for Baccalauréat, is asked by her devoted old father to take him to Mecca. Strange as it may seem (if not much is known about Islam) the father wants his son to guide them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia on a unique religious pilgrimage in his life. The generation gap between father and son is based on fairly simple terms ("you might know how to read and write, but you don't know anything about life," his son's nameless father ", but a sort of bromidic literature of generation gap is avoided They are not affectionate in their frustrations. The father never speaks in French although Reda understands Arabic, but he can only seem to answer in French. Even though they meet many people on the street: "There is the fearful old woman they collect at border with Bosnia, on the road to Belgrade, and the talkative Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian), who helps them on the border with Turkey, the reticent and timid women who wear burqas on the road to Damascus "the focus is always on the father and the There is not much conversation in the film that makes it fun in your eyes. See the magnificent views in each city. The director also shows you the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia even though the film is not elatively long. <br /> <br /> Generally I don't like films that don't have enough dialogue and take their power from the subtleties of cameras, but this was really cool. Despite some unanswered details (like Reda's French girl), the film appeals to the senses. Great artistic work and I remember that this film is the debut of Ismaël Ferroukhi.
