I put my first comment on this movie almost five years ago. Thus, the ideas presented in the film still seemed mostly fictitious, if they really could ever be revealed. Not anymore. Now, politics, society and the media in The Running Man really seem very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the Running Man came out) that I am present today: <br /> <br /> Concern, as the character in Richard Dawson, Damon Killian, "traditional morality". CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort from competitors. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. CHECK <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens according to the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with passports with barcode ("travel pass" in the film) and sanctioned under the pretext of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> An increase in mixing, bordering on incest, government and the media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics sufficiently advanced to be able to manipulate real-world footage (such as the "digital matting" of Ben Richards' image on the stunt). CHECK <br /> <br /> Prisoners of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Indicating the economy further widening the gap between the rich and the less affluent; increasing number of marginal groups reacting to the restrictive noose of the great government; civil unrest fermenting just below or on the surface of almost all major public events, regardless of their origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novel. But for safety, I'm moving to Switzerland.
