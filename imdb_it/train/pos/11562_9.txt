I simply can't understand how brilliant the pair between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It is as if the film did not even need additional characters because one can never tire of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon had already been on many famous films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau had just won his Academy Award-winning fortune cookie (another Billy Wilder movie with Lemmon). That film in particular was not exceptional like this because the story could not sustain such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this goes to an hour and a half, although the introduction of the events leading to Lemmon that ends up in Matthau's apartment is a bit long (so was this sentence). This is a small inconvenience and for the rest of the execution time you have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I have already written a comment on how the sequel to this film has been sucked up and will not delve into that. The reason this is such a joy is probably that the film was made just like innocence American films were starting to fade quickly into oblivion. There are some sexual references but they are treated so innocently that you can't even get a "Well, I never ..." from the most demure person out there. It's kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that's probably why the sequel didn't work because Matthau and Lemmon said a lot of f-words that didn't fit them. <Br /> <br /> Of course, now they are both gone and you can be happy to still enjoy them in a wonderful movie like this. I think the only male actor in this film that is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman recently died. So that's it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Add: I just heard recently that John Fiedler died so all the fans of him are deeply sorry. I didn't want to be disrespectful and I'll try to be more attentive to what bla bla blahing next time.
