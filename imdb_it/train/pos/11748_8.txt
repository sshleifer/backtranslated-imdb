Stumble. I must say that at first I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but trusting the show, and the unquestionable talent of Abe Forsythe, I kept watching. I can safely say that now I'm glad I did it. The story has developed quite well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most have no information at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can criticize in this production is the slightly annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really brings this show over the line. Here's to hoping for another season!
