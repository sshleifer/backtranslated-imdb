One of my favorite "home" movies. I don't know if there is someone in our country who hasn't seen this movie! It's funny and sad in some moments ... I don't know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to see it) made this film, because you have to know some moments of our Serbian history and the character of the Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, to be able to understand it! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who looked at him ... and liked him. <br /> <br /> I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but before finding out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Thanks.
