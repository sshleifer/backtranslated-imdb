Always a fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I watched this film on DVD without much hope of fun; indeed I expected to arrive in disgust for remote control within fifteen minutes. But instead I really liked this production, and I particularly appreciated and appreciated the way in which the producers and the director managed to tell the background of Modesty Blaise. They have managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) film version of the books we are all so familiar with, choosing instead to focus on a period in Modesty's life that they only refer to in novels. <br /> <br /> As for production values ​​(and I'm not a film student!): yes, the film was shot with a limited budget and time, and maybe that shows ... but it spoils the fun of the viewer? In this case, I think not. Instead, we are introduced to one of the greatest literary heroines in the world and have a taste of his abilities. <br /> <br /> About the casting: because in the unknown territory the only people who really matter are the modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me they were absolutely credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wood, and too thin to be a heroine of action, brought Modesty's balance and elegance to the screen; his technique (when martial arts were needed) but, above all, personified the integrity that is at the heart of Modesty Blaise's canon. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this movie was produced to put the Miramax claim into play. look forward to seeing the next production of this series by these producers, as long as they respect the fundamental values ​​and characteristics of the original stories!
