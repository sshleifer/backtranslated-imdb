There are few films that seem to offer realism as well as realism. If you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern warfare, take a look at this. <br /> <br /> Did I love the scene where hundreds of soldiers shoot in the jungle, no one is sure where that shot came from? <br /> <br /> And, they've scratched a scene to Saving Private Ryan, so it must have some merit in the scene. <br /> <br />
