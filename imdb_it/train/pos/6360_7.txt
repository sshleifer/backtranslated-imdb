I have just read the main comment for this film which is on the first page with the results of the voting and the cast launched. <br /> <br /> Because some people can't make a movie for what they're supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This film should be a light heart, a touch of joy, a family comedy, things to make children laugh and things for adults, and this is exactly what this film does. /> <br /> I laughed heartily at this film, I thought that Carey did a great performance and the whole movie (if watched at Christmas) really gives you some festive joy <br /> <br / > So all of you film reviewers stop trying to look like movie students and beat every movie because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take movies for what they should be, entertainment !!
