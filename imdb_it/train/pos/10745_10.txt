Let the problem touch first, James Hanlon is absolutely bad at trying to interpret his descriptions of what was happening with the rookie training and the events of the day. In reality it is in strong agreement with other firefighters without acting aspirations that are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> Having said that it is an incredible film that is impossible to watch without tears in the eyes. I am an English boy from London, but I love New York and have visited many times before and after 9/11. It is a second home for me and I cannot help feeling devastated by the loss of life, but also by the destruction of a part of such a wonderful city. This is the real deal, with the fire department with everything that is collapsing around them. I'm so glad the movie exists to show people what day it was like. It's a pity they didn't use images of people jumping from buildings because the friends who were there told me it's such an important part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell, by the way.
