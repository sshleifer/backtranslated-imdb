With the current trend of coarse humor, this film is the grandfather of all of them. While some of the humor is dated, any skit can shock, repel or make you laugh out loud. The most memorable is the comment on sex games and, of course, the VD commercial. It doesn't always work, but pays off when it does. I give this a 7.
