This is the silly movie of a thinking man. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, this could turn into a cult classic for you as well as my wife and me - from launching the "voice" of Gary Grant and Jack Nicholson as Martians to the overly simplistic population of Big bean this is a movie that you can look through or watch carefully and have fun both ways. <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing the humor that takes you a quick mind to see the joke while slipping you will like this movie.
