To put it simply, I liked this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not related to anything other than the object itself. I had heard stories of my mother and my grandmother about how Northern England worked class life and attitudes (as they lived) and this is an interesting representation that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular, the paternalistic but overbearing father who "knows" what is best for his family along with his stubbornness when this paradigm is challenged. (Not much has changed there then !!) <br /> <br /> The people who have seen the play will probably be disappointed in the film because the story does not move easily through different media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document and I personally liked it, even if only for the way in which it transmitted a social phenomenon.
