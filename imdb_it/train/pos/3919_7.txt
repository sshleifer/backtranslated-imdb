While tracing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play the lead role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman unable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has a relationship with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original work, intertwining fiction with reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great film from the Carlos Saura trilogy dedicated to the dance of flamenco. The dramatic love story develops with the lives of the artists intertwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times it is absolutely unclear whether what is happening is reality (with dancers) or fiction (of drama). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of Bizet's famous work, based on the novel by Prosper Mérimée. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
