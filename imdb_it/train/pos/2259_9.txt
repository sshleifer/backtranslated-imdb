I bought this cheap from the rest of the rental in our local store. It was almost in excellent condition, and I had never heard of it before. Clearly no one else has had it. <br /> <br /> I can't believe my luck. Cross the whole realm of emotions and try to overcome a complex message, the very moral and non-triumphant position of the Mandela Party, without a doubt. Despite its enormous length (I had to watch it in two sessions) - it was like a book that could not be repressed. Perhaps the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of the thing goes on forever. I can't understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) isn't realistic! I saw "South Pacific" and I also read the book, and I can guarantee that the musical is not realistic compared to the book. I will treasure this little discovery until it is exhausted. One day they will do it again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
