As much as I like big epic images - I'll save you the name -ropping - it's nice to recover with some beers and a simple action sometimes. Movies in which the plot takes a back seat for set pieces. Films in which dialogue is not written in such a clever way that it is bound in endless nodes of purple prose. There are hundreds of movies that fit the bill ... but I think Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the best. <br /> <br /> It is an update of the film that shares its name. It also shares the ethos of this image, but execution is not entirely. Whatever was exceptional in the original has been simplified. Everything that has been streamlined has also been expanded thanks to a larger budget. Often this type of effort is the recipe for complete disaster - see the repulsive remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it up - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds. <br /> <br /> The plot and much of the dialogue is not much to write on IMDb. Often you will have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of which directs it with different inflections. A lot of people have found this annoying; I find it a smile. Each actor has the chance to show his definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack, of course (and it should be noted that it is also fun to see Mrs. Pitt did not give the first billing here). The chemistry between the good old Saint Nick the stalwart (read the review date) and Angelina leads to a couple of good moments. <br /> <br /> The villain isn't even a bit scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play hard roles before I know he can handle them, but I think he was deliberately directed at making his role irrelevant for not distract from the action. We know that heroes will succeed in some way; we are just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the journey. I think many of these scenes were played with such a blatant language that it passed over the heads of many people who gave a poor rating. In fact, I wouldn't have minded a fourth-order wink at the camera: it's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not performed * only * so - it would be useless if the action were not there. And for the most part, it is. Wonderfully so. I noticed that it seems to be a common trend to use extreme fast cutting plans to direct the action these days. Personally I find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer films like this in which the stunts are impressive enough not to need artificial tension, continually violating close shots. I was told that Cage actually did the most automotive tricks that he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and shows. Man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the climatic ending that burns slowly and leads a Mustang into the ground in the most extravagant way - and FUN - possible. <br /> <br /> So yes, this film is not an "epic, affirmative post-9/11 image with mandatory social effort". The rhythm is irregular, some scenes may have been cut and not all the actors pick up the line. But car films are rarely better than that. So if you hate machines ... why are you reading these comments?! <br /> <br /> I will take control of the many iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" (guess the franchise) every day. 7/10
