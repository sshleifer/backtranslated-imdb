TOM HULCE * turns into another Oscar-winning performance as Dominick Luciano, the garbage destroyed by the brain that is helping to put his brother (Ray Liotta as Eugene) through the faculty of medicine. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and people! <br /> <br /> ===========> * From the small studder to the eratic dance, to the repeated words "Oh, Jeez" every time Nicky finds himself in a difficult situation, the belief of Tom's performance is so excellent that you will have to concentrate to remember that he is an actor on the screen!
