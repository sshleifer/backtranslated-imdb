Wow! Wow! Wow! I've never seen a non-preaching documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has no narratives and combines footage of truth with sensitive interviews with four teenagers in China who live in a factory. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. Still, most of their days and nights are made of work, work and work - but the filming of their work is enlightening and mesmerizing to watch. The factory owner in China is extraordinarily open, so much so that it affects the effects of globalization while "punishing" workers. Strictly following the Mardi Gras beads from China at the Carnival, the film reveals how the venue is linked to global humor and interesting and convincing footage from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the intercultural introduction of factory workers and party-goers of Mardi Gras through the images. Here, the film arrives at the starting point and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never a preacher, is not guided by guilt, and allows everyone's point of view to be present. In the end, we - the spectators - elaborate our conclusions on the complexity of the film and on globalization.
