When I was six, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones", and even though I was just a kid I did everything necessary to convince my parents to show me "The Champions" and "The Avengers" once a week. I think it was the Golden Age of English series ... (I already have the complete cycle of "The Prisoner"!), But it lasted a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" (I alone , or this is "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, sooner than I wish "The Campions" to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for "Dr. Who" (bundles the whole series in a set of, um , maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more on this, 8), "People of Tomorrow", and many other "low budgets", but great stories to be available within my reached areas. Speak and understand English, but not all my relatives, including my parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope that one day someone will feel the attraction of these series and then sell them as I originally saw them. Nicknamed or subtitled, but in the same format I saw them. I remember, Zone 1 or 4 are OK with my TV!
