Something about "Paulie" touched my heart like some movies do. It's a witty, fun but exciting film. I'm a little late in becoming a fan of this movie. I didn't see "Paulie" until May 2004 and since then I've ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effects of showing Paulie are superb. My son asked me how the bird knew so many sentences. Probably my favorite part of the film is when Paulie is in the company of Gena Rowlands (Ivy) followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as a good-hearted human. You root it for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong by renting or buying this movie !!
