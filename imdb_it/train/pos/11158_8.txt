The shocking and well done chiller is an underrated story of atrocious murders and evil forces. <br /> <br /> The provincial doctor tries to find out who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murders. <br /> <br /> The nightmare is a close mystery, with some horrible sequences of murders, which merge into an offensive and disturbing climate change. The crime scenes are intense and bloody, so this is not a film for the picky! The direction of John Hough, together with a bizarre musical score, combine to create a gloomy atmosphere of terror that runs through the film. It also carries a sort of gothic atmosphere as well. Even the filming locations are beautiful and some work with fashionable video cameras. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad. The great John Cassavetes performs a solid performance as the new doctor in the city. Also good performances by Kerrie Keane in the role of local reporter, Helen Hughes in the role of city historian, and Duncan McIntosh in the role of a tormented teen psychic. <br /> <br /> The whole nightmare is a forgotten horror film that must be discovered and re-evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
