Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends his time searching for missing children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters her life, she tells him that he is the chosen one and must find the Golden Child. Skeptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realizing that he is about to embark on a fantastic journey, involving the danger and worst of all, the Sardinian demon Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is The Golden Child the product of his time? I meant by that, Eddie Murphy and the popularity of The Golden Child exclusively for the late 1980s. As vividly as I remember how much this film entertained people in that decade, the box office was $ 79,817,937, making it the eighth biggest gain in 1986, but it faded from memory in the 1980s and became the Negro by Eddie Murphy the comedy recognizes him as he once did. The Golden Child does not live up to Murphy's most accepted images of the 80s as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but after revisiting the film I recently discovered personally that it contains Murphy for its playful, playful and fascinating baptism! , seriously! > <br /> Cashing in on a fantasy action formula reinvigorated and tempered by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Beautiful girl, daring reluctant hero with a joke in her armory, evil villain {Charles Dance so English that I could kiss him myself}, wonderful color, and a cute boy with mystical powers, the film asks you only to be involved in fun, not to dissect and digress its value as an image of cranial fantasy. Yes, the CGI daemon now looks creaky, and yes the genre had much better images in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but actually if you agree with the dishonorable rating of 5 here on this site, you might as well take this serious, serious genre a little too much. 7/10
