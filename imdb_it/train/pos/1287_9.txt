"Let's Bowl" started on local television in the Twin Cities. He arrived late at night, something you would have tripped on while you were sailing on the canal after your seventh bottle of Hamm. <br /> <br /> The commercials were also produced locally, with Wally outside of Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stuttering nervously - "Ahh ... you, Steve Sedahl." I don't know why, but that always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling contest under the pretext of resolving a dispute between two bowling players, but the game was secondary to the comment and the clips. Sedahl played everything smooth, counterbalanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt". The highlights included segments such as "How to properly dispose of an old bowling ball" (throwing them into a lake) and "Suggestions for appointments", where the duo "gave a couple of prostitutes and Wally ends with a bitter complaint," I did it too! "<br /> <br /> Another segment - what the duo did in their days off - saw Steve in a jar of beer spread out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, dressed in her tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones. Funny! <br /> <br /> Wally's enthusiastic comments about "bowl bowlers" and his struggle to apply correct euphemism to various divisions were also highlights. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was chosen by Comedy Central and had some good moments, but the network never really knew how to use it, performing it in prime time and emphasizing the "competition" of bowling, which it was never the point of the show. The constant advertisements interrupted the flow and the side characters (Ernie, the pig, Butch, etc.) They were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and a little forced. Even Jon Stewart disagreed with Let's Bowl on the Daily Show - (not enough complaints, jokes?) - an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved much better. <br /> <br /> How often does a "Let's Bowl" come into the world of modern television, a mix of comic genius and total disgust of local flavors? The nets have the "total disgust" in part cold, but it is a sad thing to see them kill a gem so dark, strange, funny as "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> Here's hoping they will release it on DVD.
