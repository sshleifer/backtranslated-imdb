If you love Long Way Round you will love it so much. It is educational, fun, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too many Russians. Ewan makes some appearances but Charley really does it alone. It's fun, addictive and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Big things! <br /> <br /> The series ends in 7 episodes. Like LWR, preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Even if they cover the background of the race well, there may be more explanations about trucks and cars, which are simply mentioned and are rarely seen even competing. It's a movie for motorcyclists and anyone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series presents an extraordinary photograph and some interviews with people's mouths. Yikes. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR, but this is not nearly as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the United States, god knows when it will be released, then buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh, and be ready to buy another bike.
