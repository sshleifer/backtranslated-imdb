A couple (Janet and Richard) camp in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes refuge in what they consider to be an abandoned farmhouse. Soon, a couple of escaped prisoners show up and, after a long delay of the inevitable, proceed to rape Janet and block Richard in a bird cage. <br /> <br /> This LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT film must be one of the most underrated horror films ever made. He is one of the most sick and twisted shockers of the early 1970s. Furthermore, I found this to be quite charming and beautiful in its perverse tone. I love TERROR CAGATO. Music certainly helps to give the film a sense of personality and also a lot of beauty. I found the film quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> Defects have mainly to do with the rhythm of the film, which means that the film is rather slow and tortuous. While I didn't care about the pace due to the beauty and suspense of the movie in question, I think it will be most people. The acting is not too good nor the dialogue, at least in the first scenes. This film requires a little more patience than usual, and in reality it is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a good movie. It's not the biggest horror I've ever seen, but it's definitely a lot of fun. Not exactly the easiest movie to find. You can find it in the USED section of many stores if you look pretty good. It's not for everyone, but if you're a junk movie fan then it's definitely worth a try.
