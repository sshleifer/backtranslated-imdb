Some people have stated that starting from the 11th season, South Park started a tendency to abandon their politically biting satire for superficial parody; but this could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode parodies the Living Dead series, there's more. It is a satire of how people treat the homeless. The characters say things like "They are pretending to be like us" or "They want to be human". This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower classes who are often just unlucky. <br /> <br /> So yes, it is still a satire and also a wonderful parody. What more could you want?
