I have the feeling that the World War II era musicals will become much more relevant over the next two years. Yes, we are in the economic stasis (or you lived under a rock) and the times seem gloomy. But we always have films as a way to escape our problems. In the 1930s, cinema was very popular even at the height of economic sadness. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one of the films that the public turned to. While this musical directed by Lloyd Bacon fails to capture the social issues of the time as does "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)", it is nevertheless a wonderful demonstration of talent. We have to wait until the end of the film for the three central Busby Berkely numbers, but boy, are they worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her interceptions are so-so, but Busby's magical "By A Waterfall" shakes her, and what appears to be a hundred other chorus girls, in a country of dizzying water wonders. Obviously the Busby numbers could never really be performed on a stage (they defy the limits of gravity, for one thing), and they contrast in a terrifying way with the realism of the difficult and witty non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his too-few musicals (really, what couldn't this man do?). He even arrives to take the lead man's place, he wears a sailor costume and fawn past the Shanghai Lil sexpot (which is really a small Ruby wig in China!). He is co-star with Joan Blondell, his adorable adoring secretary that Cagney somehow faces in favor of other women (up to the last reel, that is). Apparently Blondell was the only other woman that Cagney loved besides his wife. And you can see mutual worship in every scene.
