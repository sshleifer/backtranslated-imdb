The big problem is where to start, as this movie requires your attention for the next two hours and you don't miss a few minutes to get a coke because there's a danger you can't follow. But good there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis has to travel in a timemachine to find out some antiviruses for a virus that caused animals to rule all over the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, he ends for the first time in 1990, then in the First World War and how everything could seem as messed up as, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This former Monty Phyton man knows exactly how brilliant science fiction stories must be told and his choice of cast could not be better, there is the crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who demonstrates to be more than a certain Schwarzenegger, he wants to be. It is a film that you can watch over and over again as the script is so strange and complicated (yet you can follow) that every view offers you more surprises. One of my favourites.
