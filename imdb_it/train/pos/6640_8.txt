This one-minute film is probably the first film ever made. Other inventors had previously filmed actions - such as the moving photograph of an Edison sneeze - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that shook the vehicle. At the time, of course, their "cinema" must have disoriented their peers, including their subjects. In this first case, the brothers record the employees who leave their factory, some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera. The Lumieres try to make the film more fun by introducing animals and a bicycle, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" almost doesn't match the ingenuity of their subsequent films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the choice of the brothers of a family ritual of the working class as a subject. Their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity towards all the people of the world, a quality that today makes the vision of their experiments extremely gratifying and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
