Unfortunately for myself - I stumbled upon this show in the late afternoon. I only took a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the plot - but above all the GREAT actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as was Jay Hernandez (from Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I like watching young actors get their due, and I felt like this show would push their career forward. I hope at least this remains on DVD, and maybe WB will take it for a second season sooner or later? Meanwhile, I'm displaying it on the ABC website from the beginning.
