Moon Child, with Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better film than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Set in Mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, Sho's brother, Sho, Shinji, and Toshi who steals and kills to make a living. In one of the thefts, Sho meets Hyde's vampire Kei who burns in the sunlight. Through the roughness of events, the true nature of Kei is shown, but no one avoids it. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal Kei, in continuous evolution, has raised Sho, and that the two have a close bond. Sho and Kei then meet Son in an outrageous shooting, and quickly become friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time still leaps ahead and shows a grown Sho, this time empty of Kei. Also explain that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through the tragedy after the tragedy, this film dives into the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It's a really touching film that is sad but at the same time beautiful. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think Gackt did a magnificent job. Hyde did a great job for a first timer. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the film had rare and short gruesome shots. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to say this film is fantastic, moving, and I highly recommend it.
