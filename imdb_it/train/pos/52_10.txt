This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, look at it. Although, a warning, you cry your eyes. I do it every time I see it, and I possess it and have seen it many times. The performances are exceptional. It is darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: a vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you've seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and light. The home room is a phenomenal film, and I consider it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting, the amazing plot and the heart-breaking dialogue. Very tense, very moving. It does not give all the answers, but makes many positive points about humanity
