I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with the Rodgers and Hart score, but could not solve the copyright problems, so Burke and Van Heusen who wrote most of the songs for Bing Crosby together contributed a very nice score. > <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this film "fits Crosby like a glove" and I couldn't have put it better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie and in 1949 Crosby was Hollywood's most banking star. For once Paramount has used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming has never been more beautiful on the screen. This was a woman for whom the Technicolor was invented. <br /> <br /> The origins of William Bendix in Brooklyn stand out, but it is for a good comic effect. The Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke trio have a lot of fun with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his optimistic philosophical numbers patented with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. <br /> <br /> The third song sings Once and For Always alone and with Rhonda Fleming. That song was nominated for Best Song, but it was eliminated from Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Also nice that Bing managed to record the score for Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comedic talents without Bob Hope. I like photos of Road, but Bing was a comic talent about himself and this film has a better demonstration than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
