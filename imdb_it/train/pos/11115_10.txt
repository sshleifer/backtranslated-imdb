I think The Sopranos is a fantastic show for all supporting characters. I've bought every video so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far, the best is surely the episode n. 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode is about my all-time favorite character in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killed a truck driver. Brendan was fantastic because he was actually one of the few characters that actually sided against Tony and his band. In the end, he ended up getting shot through the eyes while bathing, and that's the most beloved scene in the history of the Sopranos. Brendan Filone is the number 1 for me. And my absolute favorite character was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to kill Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy kill him in the Hucklebarney park after they captured him and tortured him. My favorite character n. 3 is Sean Gismonte, who was killed immediately after shooting Christopher. And finally, my favorite character # 4 is Chucky Lord, one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the fantastic characters are dead. This is the only negative thing about sopranos. All the fantastic kids are always killed. Do you know what would be nice to change on the Sopranos? They should have an entire episode in which they show all the supporting characters who died in hell and are all trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie, because they need revenge. Brendan Filone will answer !!!!!!!!! 1
