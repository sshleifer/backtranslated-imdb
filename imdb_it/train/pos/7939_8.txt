How nice to have a movie that the whole family can see together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who get married in Las Vegas on a whim and therefore not only have to give the news to their children, but they have to try to merge their respective families (everyone has two boys and two girls) in a cohesive family unit. What transpires when the group, which includes four teenagers, two preadolescents and two younger children, is surprising at first if there will never be true happiness for Carrie and Jim. The struggles between the children (and a small love story between two of them) make one wonder if everyone will be able to get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, this is a really nice way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
