Hidden Frontiers - is more than a fan fiction - it is well thought out and organized in series, keeping the world of Star Trek alive and growing. From a fun little fan project to a well-known series today; Hidden Frontiers has a little something for every star trek fan in it. Set in the Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager historical series, Hidden Frontier addresses issues and issues raised in other Star Trek series with stories set using well-developed characters, story lines and narrative arcs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has addressed social context stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and showed the development of characters in long-term space assignments - the real things that happen up close as well as an exciting space war and conflicts Ski - The addicts know and love. Done in a "Green Screen" study; Hidden Frontiers brings a roaring cast of habitu√© to the screen and into your hearts. The great cast of actors performs well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. The inventive use of green screen technology, props, tricks and costumes work to make the Star Trek Hidden Frontier worlds fun and credible. Hidden Frontier went where few steps to go to the world of science fiction, and thrived once they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out site, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting personnel and a fun weekly chat. I highly recommend taking the time to download and watch.
