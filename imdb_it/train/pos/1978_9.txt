This production of Oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story extraordinary is a brilliant and brilliant character, who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the most serious dangers in the hands of his own relative. Yes, even if Oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he does not fear evil. A rod and a staff are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved by the scum of humanity. After all, there is Fagin, the most evil of the lot. Fagin contemplates repenting his ways not once but twice, but refuses because he is not willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because he raises small pickpockets who become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is pure but not proven. The best is Nancy. Lack of judgment, ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikes from his deep need for love. However, unlike Fagin, at the probable cost of his life, he repents of his sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not what they seem. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art worthy of being - unpredictability. I would give this film a "10", but the soundtrack and the atmosphere of his 70s music were distracting. Overall, a beautiful dish and a story absolutely appropriate for all audiences.
