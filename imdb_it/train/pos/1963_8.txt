We begin all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 films a year over the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored to receive lifetime movie passes in any movie at any time at no cost! So we can see everything we want when we want. The point is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local critics or national criticisms like Ebert are not at all different from you or me. The only difference is that they can write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money for two hours of fun it is good enough for us! We NEVER listen to or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know like us. Pretty good about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not only good but very good. Critics are a bunch of idiots. Only because there is nakedness and language they hated him. It was worth the ticket price and that's all you can ask for. It's not right? Each film cannot be nominated for an academic award. Sharon's stone is wonderful and does a great job in the film and confuses me about what the critics want
