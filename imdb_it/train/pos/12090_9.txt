I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parents' basement Saturday night. It was screened on "Chiller Theater", a normal scary movie that I watched religiously when I was young. Now, I've seen many old horror movies thanks to Chiller Theater, but nobody ever struck me as "Danse Macabre", a.k.a. "Castle of Blood". Now I am 51 years old, and only last year I was lucky enough to find a relatively recent and high quality DVD version of this fantastic supernatural classic, after thinking that I would never be able to see it again. I've seen it four more times before and can't get tired. <br /> <br /> They no longer make spook movies like this. The haunted catacombs and haze cemeteries do not work as well in color as black and white throughout the day. However, this has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, delightfully shady, haunted sets of spiderweb-haunted castles, restless spirits reminiscent of their death ... and a maliciously ironic ending. <br /> <br /> IMO, this is right there with "The Haunting" by Robert Wise, "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr) and the most recent "The Others".
