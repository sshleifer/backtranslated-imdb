I think this film was one of the good films of Kurt Russels. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in every role he plays. But this film had a lot of action and I know it should have more than 5.6 out of 10 on the meter, but many people didn't like this movie. Oh well I thought it was nice so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and you like it, I think you should also see Back Draft with Kurt Russel. DÃ² Soldier *** 1/2 of *****
