I liked this movie but I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am fifty years old and I have many friends in the music world ... who are still trying to become adults ... no longer fans, groupies, money, etc ... and are having difficulty adapting to a normal life ... since the new groups etc stand out ... it's almost as if they had to start over ... this film is a testimony of what many of the old rockers of the 70s and 80s are going through now .. .. and that's where I find the film sad and depressing. But it portrays the life of an old rock star, abandoned and lost in a credible way. The girl who comes to her decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is a woman in a movie that you will support. This film is a must for 50-year-olds who have seen the rise and fall of groups, people who knew the members and looked at them wounded as age creeps in and the popularity fades. This is an almost perfect movie ... .sad but in a positive way .... because of whales. MUST SEE!
