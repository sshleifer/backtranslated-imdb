I really liked this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen it many times and can't wait to see it again. Although it lasts only 107 minutes, most of the plot and secondary textures have been satisfactorily developed. All the characters are well represented. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel without adding stupid jokes like in Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. The setting and the costumes were beautiful. I find this version quite on par with the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice", but then the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a great job playing "Emma" which Jane Austen said would create a heroine, but she would love it. He is snobbish but has enough youth and inexperience to still be nice. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr. Knightley, not an easy part, I think, even if he doesn't have the charisma shown by Mr. Darcy of Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice. Even the final scene (the harvest festival) that does not happen in the novel provides a fitting conclusion, except when it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill while in the novel she was completely reconciled with him, telling him that she would enjoy duplicity, if it had been in his situation. A strange departure from the fidelity otherwise shown throughout the film. I find the most beautiful and elaborate costumes that in other adaptations of the novels of Jane Austen.
