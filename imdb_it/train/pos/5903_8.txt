I liked this movie it reminded me of my marriage. It's very clean you can see it with your family. Very well done. The songs are good too. I think the writer is fantastic. The film shows how marriages progress over time. They have couples in different stages of life and relationships in their lives, the film beautifully describes some parallel phases in the same story. Some of the dialog boxes are quite good. The film describes complex human emotions very well, not with excessive dramatization. After all, even the show is not so perfect. It shows very well the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
