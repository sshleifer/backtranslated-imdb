In the opening scene, the eye patch that wears the desperado named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when it follows Johnny in the pueblo, it is shown with a scar on its patched eye. This is just one of the many interruptions of continuity in this "spaghetti" western, but rather than detracting from the picture, it adds a special touch to the process. <br /> <br /> Another occurs when Sanchez turns in his three dead bodies, must be examined for their identities - "Can't imagine how many false bodies we have in our city". Soon after, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) shows up to collect his size with no more than a wanted poster in his hand. <br /> <br /> As for the principal of the film Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), he is shown with his holster alternately to his right and left hip for the whole movie after swapping belts with Carradine after the bar fight. Johnny is headed to San Margo at the request of his uncle, but will have to avenge his death at the hands of his deceitful wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and his conniving brother Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes some time to get there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best recorded music scores. As for that saloon fight, I enjoyed the kung fu sound effects every time a fist connected. <br /> <br /> Take care of other exaggerations in the story? After the duel with Pedro the first time, Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from the lip that manages to dirty Pedro's entire face. Similarly, when Pedro approaches little Pepe later in the film, he doesn't cut it, but when Johnny arrives, Pepe's face is covered in blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best of the genus that Clint Eastwood does not have inside. Like Johnny, Mark Damon is a reasonably suitable interlocutor, but without the seething exterior. Carradine seemed to be a substitute for the obligatory character of Lee Van Cleef, without being a bad boy. At first the exchange of identities between Carradine and Johnny did not seem to make sense, but it was all tied to the time when the film ended. You knew that every henchman would end up getting his due; marking time for each was part of the anticipation. <br /> <br /> In case you are wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with Nick Adams' character of classic Western TV "The Rebel". In this film, Johnny got his name from a gunfight he had once had at Yuma. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most singular element of the story concerned the way he tied things up with the evil Samantha who pulled the bows backstage in everything. After shooting Carradine, he quickly beats a retreat before Johnny can get his revenge. Still alive, it seems that Carradine tries to shoot her and that she is missing, but it doesn't take long for Johnny and Sanchez to follow her into the dessert where she died without water - Carradine headed for her water bottle.
