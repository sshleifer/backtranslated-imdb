When I was young I had seen very few films. My parents have rented this in all their wisdom. I was very wary about what the movie was, in fact I wasn't even allowed to watch it. Of course my brother and sister arrived and this made me very angry. So what did I do? Late at night I trashed the VCR! He kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported the vandals. Naturally I was arrested, I couldn't get my foot off the television before the police arrived. I was only given a poop to speak and sent home. My parents naturally rooted me and made me work to repay the debt for the TV and VCR. This tore me to pieces, the slave labor really sucks me, but I had to do it. Housework throughout the house. What happened in the end? We have a large screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? I made my films easy and sold them to Disney! Do you remember finding Neno? Well, I wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their aquariums! They rewrote the plot, of course, and they did it in CGI because they couldn't afford to do a real action picture like I did! In the end I have never seen the movie The Head which is not dead and the evaluation I gave is my life evaluation! It's going pretty well!
