Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers that we rarely see anymore. It is well structured, well acted and does not leave us with loose parts or unanswered questions so typical in this genre. Nicholas Cage plays Michael, an unemployed Texas roughneck, desperate for a job to drive to Wyoming for potential work. He is honest because of him, but always on the dark side of destiny. <br /> <br /> After failing to get a profitable job, Michael runs into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne (JTWalsh) exchanges him for a contract killer he was summoned from Dallas, hired to do in his lovable but deadly wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Wayne provides Michael with the necessary details and a down payment for the adulterous Suzie hit. Without intending to follow, Michael accepts the money and then sets off to warn Suzanne of her imminent demise. It also sends a letter to the local sheriff who exposes the plot and divides. <br /> <br /> As fate would have dictated, Michael will not get rid of the situation simply. While parting in a violent storm, he runs towards Suzannes' lover. Obviously Michael is Michael, he takes him to the local hospital where he finds out that he too was hit. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is summoned and, luckily for him, Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while he is captured during the last race and is subsequently captured by the real "Lyle of Dallas", played with murderous joy by the strange Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they are fellow marines, Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at, where else, the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are looking for Michael who voluntarily falls on Suzannes waiting for weapons. <br /> <br /> As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed thieves, on the run for millions of dollars stolen. Getting the money now becomes the central focus movie with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The film was very well launched. Nicolas Cage was generally low key, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample capacity. The best performance was by the late J.T. Walsh who was threatening without looking. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The photography of Marc Reshoskys has used many unique corners that have contributed to the development of suspense and plot. The film was further enriched by the strict directorial style of John Dahl and the rapid fiery editing of Morris Chestnut.
