During the opening night of the Vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. As the show continues, the police attempt to rebuild who killed who and why before the curtain. <br /> <br /> I always knew it was a great comedy classic, so I was excited to get a copy. Unfortunately nobody told me about the musical numbers going on and on and on. While the numbers are certainly the type that Hollywood has made in their glory days, they become intrusive because they practically stop the film despite attempts to weave actions around them. This wouldn't be so bad if the music was halfway decent, but it's not. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew it had only one song, Cocktails for Two, and we're forced to endure four versions: a duet, a large production number, like the Vanities finale and in the background like secondary music. I don't think Spike Jones and His City Slicker ever played that much. The rest of the film is pretty good with Victor McLaglen who has shed well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the mistress of the wardrobe. <br /> <br /> In no way essential, can I recommend it if you think you can beat the musical numbers, or if you are willing to scan through them. It's a funny movie of the kind they don't make anymore.
