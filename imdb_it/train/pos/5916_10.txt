I saw this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin '), one night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and I didn't see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that the characters' drawings are a bit crude and unassailable today, but I think it is a satire and a very, very urban revisitation of the old stories of Uncle Remo that the Afro-American culture, created precisely in the main characters and the brash nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The briar patch . "These are not bigoted stories, mind you, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I who am a white woman I read and love those stories. And I also found an interesting view of the time capsule on the black culture of Harlem, New York in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Well, to get to the heart of this movie: This movie is an action-animated / live movie, which starts in live-action with a buddy named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friends, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to escape from prison, but are stopped by a checkpoint and end up in a shootout with the police. While he waits for them, Randy reluctantly listens to the other escaped Pappy (Scatman Crothers), as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young man who has just arrived in the big city who quickly rises from the darkness to dominate all of Harlem; You know, for me, Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live footage, is the film a graphic satire condemned by stereotypes prevalent in the 1970s? racial, ethnic and other. <br /> <br /> So anyway, it's another good Bakshi movie; And should we sweep movies like this under the rug? pretend that they never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should watch these films involved and find out what happens then, how far we have come since.
