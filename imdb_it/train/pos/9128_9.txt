I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke the boundaries, set a decade, customs, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I continue to play the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be the prince and revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the film itself, I meant only what I said in the title, because for the most part, this film is made from music. The acting? Please don't let me judge this as this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know it wasn't a worthy Oscar in any way. But I think the duo who took this film were Morris and Jarome, their password talk was simply hilarious. I just want to classify this film in concert sequences because I felt it was what made the film. <br /> <br /> Prince is a musical genius and has created wonderful music. While the film and acting are pretty ugly, this film is still fun to watch in the evening and even dance. This movie defined the 80s, so have fun with it. The prince would like it to be like this, just to celebrate! Oh boy, he looked lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
