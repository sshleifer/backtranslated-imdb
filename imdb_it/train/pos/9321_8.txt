As romantic comedies, this was nice and winning. I thought the writing could have been stronger to build the final connection a little better, but it's not a huge starting point. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give beautiful interpretations and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was glad to see them play as romantic leads. I hope to see them present more projects soon. <br /> <br /> In general, this film will not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and winning. It is not a bad thing to be at all.
