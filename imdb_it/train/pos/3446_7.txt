Yesterday I took part in the world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I enjoyed myself. It was sold out and saw the participation of all the major stars including my space colleague Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 which starts with a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can imagine the typical university environment with wild parties and ongoing flirting. The photography in this film was excellent. Meet Jared (Chad Faust) and become lovers. It looks like any other relationship at the beginning. The man is looking for the attention and affection of the woman and the woman is playing hard to get. Both played well. Very innocent flirt between the two. He invites her into his apartment and everything collapses. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very sad and dark. Eventually they end up in the basement, which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. This actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here is where it shows its true colors and proceeds to rape it. This is a very dark and violent rape scene. This scene is not for the young or the faint of heart. The rape scene is a bit long and difficult to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the film that follows. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her soul for drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. He starts attending the wildest parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection of how it arrived. She is told to visit Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone who needs to save". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a relationship of dependence that comes into play later in the film. The club's scenes at this point in the film are photographed with extreme competence. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the cinematographer was applauded at the end of the screening during the audience credits. <br /> <br /> Maya is back at college like AT and who's in her class - Jared his rapist !! You could see the confusion and emotions on Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next? His face shots and emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> What happens next is not really what is happening. You are interested in Jared. He seems to be trying to revive the relationship and be in love again. I was sitting there saying that it could really happen. It wasn't. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him into her apartment and, of course, introduces herself. Now his apartment is dark and gritty. She completely undressed him. He thinks he will become "lucky". Then she teases him like any other woman. She caresses him everywhere and is getting excited. Note: for those who intend to see this film this scene is all frontal nudity - it may not be suitable for the younger spectator. <br /> <br /> Then change the situation and become the beast and proceed to rape him. Once again, the scene is dark, gritty and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go to the last paragraph. <br /> <br /> Here is where Adrian returns to the scene. Maya has Adrian save (?) She performing extremely rough male sex with Jared. You think this is the ultimate revenge. Adrian continues to take all the virility of Jared and takes away his dignity to nothingness. Marcus, like Adrian, interprets this scene as credible as anyone can. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and strength emerges all over the screen. After the film, during a question and answer session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes this revenge will save her but I don't think she does. One of the final scenes has a close-up of Mays's face and you see a tear roll along his cheek. This was a fabulous scene in the foreground and evokes a constant discussion by anyone visiting this film. Did he have the revenge he wanted ?? Was it as satisfying as expected? In my opinion, this is not the case. It just makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, it will play well and I recommend it to anyone thinking of going to see it. I would be a little hesitant if I were under 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be praised for their good work. Even the direction and photography must be commended. It was a night I liked.
