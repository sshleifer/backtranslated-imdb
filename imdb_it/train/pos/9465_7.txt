Steve Carell is once again the protagonist of a romantic and light film about choices, family and pressure. Judging on the plot and on the cover of the film I was expecting a flat comedy, a lot of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Of course, the film had some comedy, but it seemed much lighter than Drama and Steve Carell once again gave a great interpretation. The film itself really addresses real observations and this was a strong element that I found. But the ending seemed a little hasty and predictable. Through the film, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message he delivered was obvious, but still very important. However, he arrived at an old, flat and predictable finish. I thought that if different choices were made at the end of the film (maybe even for the bad guy, too) this movie would have achieved better publicity. Still a fun movie.
