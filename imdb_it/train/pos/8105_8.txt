SYNOPSIS The future seen from England in 1939. As the war loomed over Europe, the salvation of humanity will not be found in the politics of the past. It is the task of the brave new world of science to overcome the errors of man's past. <br /> <br /> THE CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VISUALIZER Pay attention to your leaders and what they tell you. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be descents and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PRO AND CONT I saw this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the internet (it's public domain). This is fascinating work on many levels. Since it is a story about the future seen since 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is both terrifying and extravagant. This film was at the forefront of that day. The special effects are very good as is the plot. The acting suffers a bit in the British theatrical sense, as it can lean a little towards Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. The plot of other films is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The basics of almost all the latest science fiction films can be seen in this film. The scenography and wardrobe of "Forbidden Planet", the defects of technology in "2001: A Space Odessy", even the lush landscapes / urban landscapes of "Star Wars" owe a certain inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the viewer somewhat perplexed. While he is optimistic in his final sequence of reaching the stars, we still have to wonder if humanity will ever be able to make it. Even if we reach, there are those who are trying to hold us back. The vision of this film of the future while it is interesting is also a bit funny according to today's standards. Huge flying machines and cannons that could shoot people in space never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are young in this film. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the main character, Cabel. His character appears almost like the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of film history whose themes are still current even if its vision of the future has missed its mark.
