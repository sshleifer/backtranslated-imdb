This is a poem about the film, beautifully presented and photographed with sensitive art. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of time and place. (The lake district of Italy in the 1920s). It's a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and credible. The settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes --- the funeral ship in the fog --- the long and high stroke of the chess table in the middle of a tile floor with complicated motifs --- are beautiful images. And rather than the obligatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweetness. If the film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
