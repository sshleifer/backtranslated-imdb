The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are too disgusting and the film itself is too dated to be appreciated today. The Bette Midler version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, a free-spirited single woman who becomes pregnant and refuses the help of her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an undervalued performance). She raises her daughter Jenny so gently played by Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and eventually makes a life-changing decision. Through the film, there are lots of laughs, tears and memorable moments especially between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason is the co-protagonist of Jenny's future stepmother, who, although rich, turns out to be an excellent influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just beautiful movies with lots of excitement, you will enjoy the STAR version of Bette Midler.
