Fully deserving of its prestigious Hollywood Awards nomination, this is a fun little gem with lots of pizazz and some delicious surprises. Exceptionally amusing scenes include a hilarious (and re-shot) shot of a World War I trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as a non-com optimist and the unfortunate McDoakes as a messenger Boyer / Colman ?? all under the tiny eye of Ralph Sanford's deliciously irascible anguish; a lost McDoakes driven and re-driven by Jack Carson equally perplexed; the assistant director Chandler who welcomes McDoakes: "I will become a director!" <br /> <br /> The Ace O'Hanlon comic strip has a dual role, playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! Strangely, Richard L. Bare, who plays himself in one or more other voices of the series, rejected this opportunity here. In real life, Bare is a double of Rock Hudson, a six-foot boy, but here he is played by a veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
