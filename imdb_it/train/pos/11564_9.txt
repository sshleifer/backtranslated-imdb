I've seen this movie many times and I like that all the bad teachers want to give him ten out of ten, but they think it would be unfair for other good movies. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. Allow me to venture into one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The script is so sharp that you have to stop the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. The two derivations give extraordinary performance, the girls are superb and the situations are fun and entertaining. Not a dirty word in sight (he points out that Hollywood, you don't have to swear you're funny, you have to be witty) and the transition from the scene to the film is seamless. They don't do this anymore. Timeless.
