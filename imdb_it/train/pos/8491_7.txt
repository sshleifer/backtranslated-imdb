I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after having been here for three years, fearing that I would shudder when I saw it in the harsh light of my extensive international experience. The film pleasantly surprised me with how accurately portrays the cultural clash between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). Not all things are actually present, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film for the impartial treatment of the two parts in history. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialog was reversed in the Japanese version to cover obvious delivery problems in the second language. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a reviewer uses it in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan by watching this movie rather than reading any of the "serious" books on the subject (most of which were written in the 1980s and funded by corporate propaganda Japanese). <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who, among other things, found it implausible that the Japanese would like to build cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese manage many factories there to be close to customers and to avoid commercial frictions.) This is a very hot and funny film that I would say higher if it weren't for some clich√©s of the 80s, like dancing electronic disco music of cheese. Michael Keaton has never been more fun.
