I saw this film in 2005 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw I would classify them as my number 3 film. I had a first interest in seeing this being of Swedish origin myself with many of my region ancestors of Norrland in Sweden, where it was filmed. I also grew up in an area of ​​rural forests in North America, where many small towns were very similar to those in this film. It's nice to see more movies using rural locations like their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a very nice film and I'm sure it's a very difficult film to put together with its big ensemble cast, but director Kay Pollock really removed it after an absence of almost two decades from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her film debut as an actress has been fantastic and I can't wait to see her on the big screen. I liked Michael Nyqvist at the head of this all-round cast. I highly recommend this movie and rate it as 9.0 on a scale of 10.
