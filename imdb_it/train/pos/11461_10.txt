Beside the fact that, in all its incredible beauty, this film has grown beyond my expectations, this masterpiece of the history of cinema portrayed the excessive use of poor filters at its best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a conflict of siblings with everything there is to do. As usual, a woman with her true intentions. The end was as surprising as the unforssen as the killing of Keith Scott by his older brother. <br /> <br /> The "wiking land" scenes are just like I remember from my first time travels. - To be honest, my strong passion for junk movies makes this a must in my never-finished collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all the people in love with One Tree Hill's most extraordinary cast. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
