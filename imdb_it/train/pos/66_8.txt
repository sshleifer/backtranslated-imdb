"Home Room" was a total surprise. Not having the slightest idea what it was all about, he paid a lot of time because he doesn't hold punches and what we see is how lives have changed since the act of a young displeased person who decided to victimize his classmates, who are innocent victims of his reckless actions. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded with incredible acting throughout the cast. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate from high school. She's been away for a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wavelength as the other students. For one, she is a rebel with a punk look, a lot of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares approach her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the house room where nine students died, presumably killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given clues. <br /> <br /> What follows is the continuation of the tragedy, since it focuses on a young woman who survived. Deanna Cartwright is a rich teenage girl who should not have attended school. When a bounced bullet hits her, she is hospitalized with more than one wound. He is trying to overcome this dark period in his mind but the nightmares don't make them forget. <br /> <br /> Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since he does not cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not love Deanna, but within a few days, both girls will make peace. We do not realize until the last sequence of what really happened on that horrible school day. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips is a great Alicia and Erika Christiansen is just as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast act like an ensemble. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity because it is not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps Mr Ryan's tone wanted to give this film.
