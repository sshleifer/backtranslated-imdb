A second episode that manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the casting is simply wonderful. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common except for wit and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode is very funny, very silly and very funny. It's the first episode of Christmas, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa Claus after killing her husband. Just like the first episode; karma. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene is a link between her husband's murder and her phone call, first feigning her fear until it becomes real.
