This is a great movie for true romantics and sports lovers. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at his best in this film. As a Drew fan it was pretty cool to see her shine after having several flops. I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he completely handed Ben the comedian, a sportsman mad with love. The comedy in this film is great, there were several loud laughter. <br /> <br /> Their first date began in a rocky way when he showed up at his apartment with flowers and fell sick to his stomach from eating a new place at the beginning of the day. Instead of leaving, she helps take care of her, helping her to turn into pajamas and then cleaning up the vomit in her bathroom and bathroom, after telling her that she was "very noble ... without pieces". Everything is fine between Ben and Lindsay throughout the winter, but then the baseball season begins. Lindsay starts to understand how obsessed Ben is with the Red Sox and why this seemingly awesome guy is still single. Try to shake it off and think it's a good thing since it has an intense work schedule and you won't feel guilty about working extra hours while at the games. He even buys all the books on The Red Sox he can find, including one on "The Child's Curse". <br /> <br /> Everything is going pretty well until Lindsay has a false alarm after losing his time. Both make both aware of how serious they are and begin to wonder if this is the person he wants to be with. A very moving part in the movie is after she tells him that she got her period shows him sadly by putting away a small size Red Sox shirt he bought in case she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ben tries to show you how important it is and decides to go to his friends' birthday party after saying "I had to check my calendar and when I saw that there was a Red Sox game / Yankee I knew I would go to season " After the party Ben tells her that it was "the best night of his life". Shortly after receiving a call from his friend who went to the game he gave up the party and told him "IT HAS BEEN THE BEST GAME EVER !!!" losing him and he ends up really hurting Lindsay when he says "A few minutes ago you were saying that this was the best night of your life", he says "well that was a few minutes ago". <br /> <br /> So they split up for a while, realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell the seasonal tickets he inherited from his uncle because if he didn't he would 'remind him too much of that who gave for them '. Lindsay discovers through a friend and decides to prevent him from understanding that he is doing it for her. It ends very gently showing how the love of his childhood for baseball has been overshadowed by a completely new and deeper love, Lindsay. They still go to the games and also participate in the last game of the World Series and in St. Louis and it's a happy ending all around. 2 inches up !!
