When I took my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it! The graphics were fantastic for his time, a good storyline, great tracks and above all, the best music I heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I don't completely remember the plot, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario must save her. The object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle. Each had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are parts of the castle, where you can get more stars. Of course, you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser * Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character, and he gets useful tips from Toad, so it's basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are plenty of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really fantastic. <br /> <br /> Next, what do you think people say that Gameplay is more important than graphics, and I completely agree. But with its great plot, there are great graphics. Especially for the moment. I have a lot of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don't compare to Super Mario. Brilliant colors, fantastic effects and fantastic sound effects. I found the graphics in the waterways very good. Next to those in the Bowser world, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, the music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up, when I played him at a young age, I would be happy to leave the game all night, so the music would put me to sleep. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful. There are also others that are great, especially in, once again, the worlds with Bowser, are the ones that are most attached to me and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite hobby as a developing player, and I love it. This game becomes 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO PLAY THE GAME!
