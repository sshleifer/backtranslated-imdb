Chalk this in the column of victory, this was a superb film. The performances were fantastic and the script was just as great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was as magnificent as Riverside police officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. He was a novice cop with the Riverside police. He ended up in a relationship with a colleague he knew had a wife and children, while taking the dangerous task of going incognito to capture a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta's look) did a tough job as the confused, often stuttering, police officer who had a relationship with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but it was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extramarital affair. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, particularly from the sitcom "Wings", did a good job as a silent, mild, unsociable sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but a cold-hearted murderer was lying beneath the surface. Weber has really taken on the personality of a young adult child with an insatiable thirst to kill boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Every scene, every verbal exchange makes us know more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with days of condensation, if not weeks of noteworthy events in a 90-minute movie. This film was a good example of how to do very little.
