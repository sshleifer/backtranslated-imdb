if you're like me, then you'll love this movie for teenagers at a great age. I think it's up there with malice / love book / high school USA / shout / calender girl / crybaby / all the great movies set in the 50s and early 60s and has a wonderful soundtrack. Not many songs like in some of these types of movies, but still great.it is so fun at times and has a great love interest. All the young casts are fantastic. they were more kind of these wonderful films. My favorite movie of all time is back to the future when Marty mcfly returns to 1955 well in these wonderful films remains in the fabulous 50s (early 60s) there are some films of this type better than this but not many.
