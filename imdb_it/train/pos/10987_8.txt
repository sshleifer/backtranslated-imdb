Trawling through the weekly Sci Fi section of the local Video Rentals store I was losing hope of finding good movies I hadn't seen before. Renting Cypher was like a bet on a horse possibly very lame. My son is so tired of the current "B" Sci-Fi that he didn't bother to see it again. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just lost it. <br /> <br /> Well, this was a really nice surprise! This is also not a B movie. It is not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety and does not seek to be - more a quiet film that must be seen several times for its plot to be savored to the full. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful presented when they are used - my only complaint is that the super helo is obviously a little CGI at first sight, but they do it well on its 2nd appearance, and apart from everything the rest is top notch. In any case, the affects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything on the plot. The structure of the plot has an aspect of Russian Doll that reminds a bit of Basic Instinct (although with very different contents). <br /> <br /> I will simply say that choosing Jeremy Northam as the protagonist was a masterstroke. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and his accent for this film strikes the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect, it's a bit out of fashion. Look at the last turn of the plot and you'll see why it's such a brilliant choice! And also Lucy Liu is right with her "she will kiss me - she will shoot me". <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies multiple times in a few days - this is one of them.
