This film is so misunderstood that it's not even funny. If you think you see this for the shoot ... be clear. This concerns the effects and the traumas that the survivors must endure. Even the detectives are looking for the answer that we all do ... WHY? A fantastic acting by the two main women as we see how those we ignore are influenced by the same things we are struck with. Yes, the language is hard at times, but it adapts well to the characters. There are some free or unanswered ends, but all the movies have these. The main issues are addressed and this film makes an important statement about how all of us adults feel after such serious incidents. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
