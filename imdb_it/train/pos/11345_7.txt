That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying film (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A boy sets off on a magical journey to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, presumably a dragon, seems more like a triton with conjunctivitis, and a magic talking flute is targeted by a witch (Billie Halliday, who at the time was considered "a little good") . <br /> <br /> The flute is recovered in an "interesting" witch convention, with witches having a gay past. The boy dresses in drag then like a "fairy" to retrieve the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
