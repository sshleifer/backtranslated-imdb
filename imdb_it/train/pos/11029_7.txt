I'm far from a fan of Sylvester Stallone and I imagine that the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French film Taxi 3, which is an almost non-existent role. Yet I must admit that this film was not so bad, even though I feared the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to save the girlfriend of one of his friends and she falls to his death from a 4000 foot peak in the high mountains, he cannot force himself to continue working as a forest ranger . For almost a year he does not put a food in the reserve, but returns. Immediately after returning, they receive an emergency call from a group of hikers trapped in a snowstorm. At least, this is what the rangers believe. It is actually a group of thieves who crashed their plane into the mountains after their daring plan to steal full cases from a runaway government plane failed. The cases are scattered throughout the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to recover them ... <br /> <br /> This is certainly not one of the most intelligent films of all time, but one of its kind is fun. I particularly appreciated John Lithgow as the evil master and leader of the gang of thieves. I know him better from the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also liked his performance in this film. Overall the acting is OK, he had a lot of action to offer and, of course, even some one-liners, but he also offered a very nice decor. This film was shot in a magnificent natural environment. I loved mountains and snow-covered valleys, mountain rivers and forests ... Maybe that's why I give this film a higher score than I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this type . I give him a 6.5 / 10. If you don't expect too much, this is a funny movie.
