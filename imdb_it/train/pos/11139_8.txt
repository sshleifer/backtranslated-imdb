Hardly the matter of which dreams are made is this search for the brass ring by a naive braggart (JON VOIGT) and his lame handmate (DUSTIN Hoffman), which will soon create a friendship based on survival skills Basic. <br /> <br /> A bold film for its time, and a prime example of the gritty type of landscape that is explored in the most graphic films of the 60s. Symbolic of the "end of innocence" in American films, since it was the only X-rated film to win an Oscar for best film. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male bully who arrives in the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight on his body, but he soon discovers that the city is a cold place without a mat of welcome to his fellows. Engaged by a crook-cheater (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serious-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of a dish of cold water for the promised sun in Florida, his friend's land "Ratzo" dreams of living inside. <br /> <br /> But even in this final research, the two are losers. John Schlesinger has subtly directed a screenplay by Waldo Salt and John Barry's "Midnight Cowboy" theme adds to the moments of search and despair. <br /> <br /> To sum up: a true honest American classic, a difficult and daring argument in showing the weak point of certain aspects of city life.
