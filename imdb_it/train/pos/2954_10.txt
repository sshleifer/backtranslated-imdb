This film, however, critically acclaimed, has not yet been released in the United States on DVD, like another major - "Housekeeping" by Christine Lahti, in the same year. But if you can support Region 4 DVDs (Australian), this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the Internet. Dave is accompanied by a great story, as well as memorable performances by his supporting cast, particularly Claudia Carvan and the deceased, great Jan Adele. Surprisingly, or maybe not, this film and its stars have not been recognized at the time of the Academy Awards, as well as "Housekeeping", but allow yourself both - you'll be glad you did!
