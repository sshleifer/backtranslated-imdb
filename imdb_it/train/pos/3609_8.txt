I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I made a wrong purchase or a good one. It is the end result of my vision of the entire film from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05, gave a great interpretation and her appearance is beautiful, sexy, and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed. Diana did not like her family life and especially her father for the abuse she had given her mother. He decides to do boxing training in a local Brooklyn gym and is not very well accepted by male boxers. In his high school there is a lot of friction between his classmates and boys. There is a lot of action in the women's bathroom and references to private parts of boys. If you like boxing and see a sexy and sexy girl do miracles in the ring and beat the guys on them you know, this is the movie for you.
