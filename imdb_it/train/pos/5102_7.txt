no matter the soundtrack, which is already played. <br /> <br /> However, Debra Winger is always interesting and while this was a previous role for her, she is quite as good as Cissy, the girl with the wrong side of the tracks, living in a trailer with Bud, (Travolta), only to be replaced for a time by the trusting citizen Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous review regarding Scott Glenn, he is only used for the plot, thrown in the mix to create suspense; the story is predictable and artificial. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, even if they are from the east, many of us do not like "Saturday Night Fever", while they had their moments, the perpetual stereotypes are beyond all criticism this point. <br /> <br /> To see for Debra Winger; she is still so nice and has never had that Hollywood character that we are subjected to too many actresses today. 7/10
