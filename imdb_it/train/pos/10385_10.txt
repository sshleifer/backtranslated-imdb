It's been a while since I saw this movie and the series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were fun together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse direct Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes to leave their farm, Bo and Luke prowl around the local Hogg yard and find samples of coal. Soon they will realize that Boss Hogg is going to strip my county of Hazzard, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the film were that Burt Reynolds was not right about Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Apart from that, I highly recommend the DUCATI DI HAZZARD !!!
