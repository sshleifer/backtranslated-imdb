A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This film is for the little ones, but it's also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He devastated his colony when he destroyed the food destined for the upper grasshoppers. He is banned and has to find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially by the end of the 90s. The story is good, but a little more detail would suffice. Voice acting is as good as most animation films. Music is pleasant to listen to. Nothing special, but got a nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this film struck me impressively. This is a good movie for all families. I consider this film 10/10.
