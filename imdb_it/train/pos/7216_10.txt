No one can ruin this job! Great movie! Written by experts of the caliber of Ira Levin and depicted with the best interpretation of Christopher Reeve's career and one of Caine's best, this is simply excellent. I wish I could take a version staged somewhere ... maybe one day I'll do it. I hope this undervalued and undervalued film has not become too difficult to pinpoint because it is a must for any Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile or great movie lover. One of the very few films that I could not solve or predict instantly and worth a second or even third view, "Deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and gains every limit. We need and deserve more films like this!
