Dream Quest was a surprisingly good film. There were some notable goofs, but that can be expected in a movie like this that was done in so little time. I didn't feel any desire to go fast during the film and I found it rather amusing. Sometimes it gets pretty silly, but overall I recommend it. They probably consumed all the glitter in nearby shops, and some of the costumes were pretty good.
