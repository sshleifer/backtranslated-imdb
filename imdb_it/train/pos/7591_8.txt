A mess of genres, but is based mainly on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for his inspiration. There is kung-fu magic, college romance, sports, gangster action and some whining melodrama for a cover. Production is excellent and the pace is fast, so it is easy to overcome the many flaws in this film. <br /> <br /> A child is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man takes him to a Shaolin monastery in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but cannot read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is occupied by a false kung fu master who is assisted by four extravagant monks. The new master gets angry with the twenty-year-old boy for not having pretended to be hurt by the weak fists of his master and throws him off for the night. The boy is found throwing rubbish in a basket from an incredible distance from a man who takes him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great fight, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery and the decision of the man to transform the boy into a feeling of university basketball. <br /> <br /> Al that happens in the first 20 minutes with most of what happens in the first 10 minutes. Apart from the extreme shorthand narrative, the first problem is how little we know about the main character until the time of the film. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined from the moment the first third is over. The plot does not follow a new terrain except for the crazy climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the extravagant monks will show themselves towards the end. The effects, the photography and the stunts are all of the highest level and compensate for the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better grasp of the plot and comedy and this film will live in its shadow but it's not a good reason to ignore it. It's pretty funny even with a burst ending. Recommended.
