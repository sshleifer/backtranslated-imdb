My friends and I were discussing how frustrated we are about the way movies are made and especially romantic comedies. We feel offended by the schlock that Hollywood is serving these days as they act as if all is well. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not all right ... except for some bright spots, like this movie. He doesn't have the big name actors, the big budget, I don't think he had a great release (I rented from Hollywood Video), he really has nothing of what most of the great budget romantic comedy has. <br /> <br /> But it has what many of them lack. He had a great harmony between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story has not been forced upon us like so many. The director took some time to allow these characters to really get to know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The supporting cast added not only really funny comic moments, but also depth to the plot. The character of James LeGros was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues in a Psychic Hotline was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how beautiful it is to fall in love.
