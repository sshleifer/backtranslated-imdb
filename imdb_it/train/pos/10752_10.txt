This was the most visually stunning, moving, incredible and incredible story I've ever seen. Frankly, even those adjectives can't describe it. I can't choose just one scene that stood out for me. I suppose if I had to list a few they would be the fireman's reactions to the noise of people jumping; the reaction of the people trapped in the elevator, who were unaware of what was happening, as they finally re-emerged into the horrible scene; the shock and disbelief of the spectators; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, and even now, I am reminded of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says: "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly screamed in terror and were suddenly silenced". It is surprising how so precise it is in his description. There really was a disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary vividly reveals this disorder. The feelings are so incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and the realization of its greatness. It's all there. Nothing was missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and moving and well-deserved documentary of the Emmy. Not just because it documents 9/11 but because it is simply all that it should be. <br /> <br /> If you're going to watch, make sure you get a box of tissues. You will need them. I know I did it.
