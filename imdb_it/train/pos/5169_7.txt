I saw the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999, one evening, when I was browsing the channel before going to bed, and I really liked what I saw. Since then I've been searching for television program listings, browsing DVD / VHS shelves in stores, but I didn't find a copy until recently, when I found out that some online stores sold it. So, being a world-class procrastinator, I haven't ordered it yet. In the end, I found a copy of a DVD in a Circuit City while visiting Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it took me about a month after I got home before sitting down and watching it. <br /> <br /> So what do I think of the movie? All right. It's not as good as I remembered and I was hoping, but it's worth the $ 9.99 cost me anyway. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, I consider it as a 7/10, with the possibility of becoming an 8/10. I will therefore have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to capture some dialogue.
