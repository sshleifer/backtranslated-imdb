The first time I had the opportunity to see this all-forgotten classic was in the early 1980s, in one of our art houses as a revival. While watching this fever dreaming of an exercise in sexuality in the 1930s, I thought YOWZA! They returned with the murder in Europe during the day. Unfortunately, this film was heavily cut in its original US version by the Hayes Office barn (the loyal government censorship council, initiated by the "holier than you" thumper, Will Hayes ... a former post office official, if you can believe it), because of its general theme of human sexuality (human beings forbidden by the sky had had sex in the 1930s). The plot of Ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man, and later regrets this. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome younger man and has a relationship with him, resulting in a divorce from her previous husband (another no no in Hollywood movies then --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time the director worked in the audio format (the film seems to possess techniques that were mainly used in silent films --- that is, the expressionism of the 1920s). It is still worth looking for a window on the first European speaking images, together with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and "Vampyre" by Karl Gustav Dryer (1931). Not classified, but contains that infamous nude swimming scene and some thinly veiled sexual references, which would do little more than a PG-13 by today's standards (but would have easily landed in the dreaded "X" in the 1930s, if it existed then)
