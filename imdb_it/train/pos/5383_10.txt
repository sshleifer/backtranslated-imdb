I thought this film was excellent, due to the fact that Corrine and Sean are the newcomers. He was full of action and a little bit of romance, but there were some points where Corrine didn't speak very clearly (when he threatened Sean with a gun) and gritted his teeth ... maybe he had to do it? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were portrayed very well, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I saw the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean did their stunts, which were done very well. . I look forward to another film of the couple, as they form a great team, or maybe a sequel to bet your life, maybe called "make it big in the big apple" ', this time it could be on Carmen .. For your life is EXCELLENT!
