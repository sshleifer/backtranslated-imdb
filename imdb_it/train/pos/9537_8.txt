Some might think that the evaluation I just gave is a bit generous, but as far as this film is concerned I think the directors did a good job with what they had at their disposal, this is also a film a film of an acquired taste ! <br /> <br /> my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film "The Thing" that is the aliens parasitized from outer space, infesting the human guest and then the chaos of reek wherever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film pays tribute to a film of this kind and to others of the horror / gore genre, even though it cleverly maintains its originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rivals! Only kill and choose a human when he needs a new guest! To then choose another fight with another infected host! And this film also throws a love story, but I won't say anything else, otherwise it gives too much. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But as I said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the movie. It is low budget and yes it is bloodthirsty, with the creatures / aliens / things that turn their limbs into rough looking weapons, that is saws, drills, blades and even the strange weapon for everyone, but decimate the opponent . I found myself thinking about what was shown to me but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like blood, you like aliens, you like to fight and maybe even some love thrown somewhere, so I have to recommend this movie as a must see. I just hope I came across this before!
