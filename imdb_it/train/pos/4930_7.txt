"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I was a little disappointed with it. The central theme of a city attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores it or develops it. It's well done and fun, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The script of this is really weak and puts the whole movie down. None of the central characters is really compelling or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well made and compensates for the weak script. The direction of Elia Kazan keeps the film full of suspense and moves at a very fast pace. There are some prominent sequences, in particular the memorable climax of the chase. When his direction was combined with better scripts several years later, the man could not do absolutely not. <br /> <br /> Even the acting is very good. Richard Widmark has always been a watchable lead man and does what he can with a signed character. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming a little too much but he also does a decent job. The cast actors are the two villains. Zero Mostel, best known for his comic roles, is actually slimy as one of the most fashionable characters in cinema. Jack Palance is, without a surprise, a bad bad guy. "Panic in the Streets" is disappointing, but still worth looking at. (7/10)
