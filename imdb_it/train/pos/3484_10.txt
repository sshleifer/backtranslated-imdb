This is just the best movie of all time! I'm sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 1970s, as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian TV, and I loved it immediately (I was then 14). 25 years later I bought it on a videotape, and a few months ago it finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I've been living with this film for 35 years, and so do all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he immediately loved it too (and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only Hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding Russian!). What makes this Danelia masterpiece so special? It's hard to say, because it's difficult to describe what the beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure that it was the first time. I can't remember any other movie like that, no matter how many millions it cost or how good the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
