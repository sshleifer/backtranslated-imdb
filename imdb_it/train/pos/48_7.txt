I come from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, I am sorry for that ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those little-known films that plays only once on TV and seems to vanish into thin air. I was looking through my old VHS video collection and found this title, searched for it and had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, it's pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I must admit that it is a very well put together film and that is why I am perplexed. This is the only film made by this director ...? Why didn't you make many films after this pretty nice ...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'd really like to see that he shows up and does another film like this, please .....?
