Although this was obviously a low-budget production, the performances and songs of this film are worth seeing. One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (he is a wonderful dancer and singer and also demonstrates his acrobatic skills - see the cartwheel!) with Jason Connery. A great story for children and very nice characters.
