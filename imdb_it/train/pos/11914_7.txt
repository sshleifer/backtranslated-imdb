You know, this movie isn't great, but, I mean, come on, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find that the plot is still hilarious, this boy's dad says he will bring it back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) time (through the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his father does not bring him back and he goes off on his own in that boy's face. it's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and is a friend. <br /> <br /> I think the good side is that the old lady is left alone to die with her sewing projects and her stories. The real winner here, however, is god. Because he later got a job as a writer for numerous pranks. <br /> <br /> As a children's movie, get a 7. As a film about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith and the nature of "god", "he gets a 10.
