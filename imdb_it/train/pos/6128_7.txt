Yes, this is a class B horror. But at least the producers, directors and cast don't expect this film to be a godsend. The plot is trivial, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is splashed with genetic acid turning him into a man of snow. The snowman a.k.a. Jack Frost then goes on a murderous rampage to find the sheriff of the small town who eventually arrested him. With a limited budget the crew had to settle for limited special effects, most of the money seems to be spent on the snowman costume. The particularly difficult shots are managed by cartoons or panoramic shots (shots in which the camera moves away to mask the details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's film and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If you don't let your kids watch pg-13 movies on their own, parents shouldn't let their children watch this movie. This film has two claims to fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major role in the film. The scene where Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth deserves to be watched a couple of times. 2. This movie has the worst snowman trick ever. The joke is so serious that the directors give credit to the joke in the credit list.
