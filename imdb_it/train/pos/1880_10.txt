Dudley Moore is fantastic in this great unknown classic. This film is a very witty film that relies heavily on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well filmed and, at times, has a very mushy music that tries to force a state of mind (the "psychological" music of the wedding fight), but the acting exceeds it. Arthur's character is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But it develops well in a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live of his own free will. The end is rather trivial, though. I won't give it away, but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times.
