While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not animated version), I think it's still a little less than what Disney could do. It was well shot, the music was better suited to the action and the effects were better (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better, but in this sequel the human characters have had much more appropriate roles, and Glenn Close is not to be missed, as in the first film. She makes it shine. His poor lackey and overzealous pinions are wonderful characters to interpret, and are added to the show that Disney gave us. This is a great family film, with little or no questionable material, yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children. It is destined to be a classic, as are so many Disney movies. Here is hoping that the third is even better, because you know that they will probably want to create one. ;)
