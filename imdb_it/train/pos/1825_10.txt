I saw this film when I was young and I remembered it as one of the first films that I really liked was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my last few years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or there was really something in that movie. To my surprise, the film has fulfilled all my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, good songs (not great though, and this actually explains why I didn't remember it being a musical) and all in all a great use of my time. I was surprised because the last films of my childhood that I have revisited have not even exceeded my minimum requests for a decent film, yet this film, which I saw for the first time, made me cry today just as it made me cry. Maybe because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes in it, but it doesn't matter. The film itself is fun and intelligent. So don't be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it's perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
