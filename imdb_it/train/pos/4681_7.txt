Overall, I liked this movie and would recommend it to independent film lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to note the similarities between the parts of this film and Nichols's Closer. A scene in which the character of Adrian Grenier is questioning Rosario Dawson about his sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where the character of Clive Owen is interrogating Julia Roberts, even if it is interpreted with less hardness and intensity in love". Also note that "Anna" is the name of both Dawson's character and Roberts. It cannot be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on the game of Patrick Marber and presumably this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen", so I'm not sure how this connection was formed. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
