SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A friend of mine said that NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong movie and bent over backwards to get me to borrow and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, no rhythm, nothing like what it defines a movie ... but it's fun. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show a little heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little paragraph I insert the plot, but being those four fifths of the film, nothing happens that usually starts a story. I will only say that Cheech's cousin appears. <br /> <br /> Was there no more fun time when Chong made Cheech pee twice? And the rooster? Was it Pee-Wee Herman's first film appearance? You should see the movie for yourself to enjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has balls that are strong enough to make it great, but the film has a heart and hey, my friend lends it to me so I can get a 7.
