I saw him last night on TV, and I was pretty happy. <br /> <br /> It is a kind of film that makes you feel kind and warm in your heart, and you believe that there is still something good in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what they were doing to help her and protect her - the old cop is my favorite), even though you know this story is not entirely realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved acting (they all looked normal, ordinary people, living in small picturesque English coastal cities), but the best thing about the film was the humor and humor it has! Just remember the scene in the store with two old ladies after they had their "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending was a bit confusing, but it didn't stop me from really enjoying, really the whole story!
