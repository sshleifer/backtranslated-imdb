The impact movie of four city bikes in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businessmen faces their darkest fears when they face a demanding journey in white water, on a river that is about to be replaced by a dam. When locals along the way decide to "make their way" with intruders, this leads to many deaths and many traumas for the survivors. Each of the travelers is exceptional, even if Voight gives the strongest command and performance. The scenery and rural culture are well captured, including the breathtaking sequence of duels banjos. I saw it on a day when it came out, not exactly the perfect dating movie (even though we both had fun). I remember this as a dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already established. It's not the kind of movie you can watch every week, but it has a strong impact and is beautifully filmed.
