A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and Broadway comedy about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colorful" sisters who have lived over 100 years. Beautifully interpreted in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively, they tell their story in flashback to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times journalist. Today's flashbacks and scenes are not as inspirational as they are in the book, but they are really powerful. However, some aspects of the sisters' lives, such as the mother's inter-racial background and the reasons for her father's severe personality, are not clearly presented. You must read the book to fully understand these things. Which is equally positive, because the book is just as great! In addition to these flaws, it is wonderfully done and performed, particularly by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
