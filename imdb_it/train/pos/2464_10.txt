One of the best drama movies I've ever seen. We do a lot of acting in church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting, such as "must see". There are several note scenes. For one, the cemetery scene when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about THAT scene simply by going to elementary school) and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was tremendous - I suppose a testimony of Shakespeare more than anything else. For a second, I really liked the scene in which Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the impending duel.
