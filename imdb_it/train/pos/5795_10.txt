This film is my favorite of all time !!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I'm always in seventh heaven, watching him !! This is a movie, which you really need to see, even if you're not a fan of MJ, because this film writes, like Capitan EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little history of cinema and music !! This wonderful film, out of the feather of Michael, is a must !! E: Smooth Criminal, it's really the most wonderful, exciting and extraordinary song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet, he's a good man and he always brings sparks into your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you don't know this movie, watch it and don't lose it, because it would be too bad for yourself if you get lost !! - Highly recommended film, for every movie lover
