The only thing worth noting about this film is that it was Steve McQueen's first major starring role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is not developed and raw but pleasantly honest in this little science fiction horror movie. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, a hot rod lover who would become a glossy icon of the film industry at just five years old. <br /> <br /> Next, McQueen would say he hated this movie and that "he was the blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. We would have all remained that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is hectic and, although predictable, it's still a fun hour. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before becoming Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD some time ago and is a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
