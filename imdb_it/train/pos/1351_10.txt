Lively and irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unexpected happiness in the life of an old sister and lonely brother on the island of Prince Edward. <br /> <br /> Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel comes to life in this wonderful little film. Excellent production values, a literal screenplay and first-class performance give the story exactly the quality it deserves. <br /> <br /> Taking her professional name from the character she played, actress Anne Shirley is a joy as a fourteen year old orphan who completely changes the lives of her new guardians. Completely assured in her starring role, Miss Shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne's boundless imagination, rapid temperament and not so secret penalties. <br /> <br /> Playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also completely commands her role; the spectator will like to see this woman with a sharp tongue who slowly becomes fond of Anne's childish affection and innocence. Australian actor character protagonist OP Heggie offers one of his best performances as the shy, kind brother of Westley who welcomes Anne into his heart from the moment he gets to pick her up from the train station. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown interprets the most pleasant pupil who quickly catches Anne's attention. Sara Haden is aptly pungent as a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin does most of his few moments as a doctor at Avonlea.
