An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first ended, with much mystery. Suspense in most, if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. One that made me think and rethink. It's really amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and connect all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the characters' lives in the show so meaningful. He never fails to excite and I can't wait for the new season to come. I hope other secrets will be revealed and, at the same time, more mystery to solve. A good selection of casts for this show also fits the characters perfectly. I really can't wait to finally discover the secret. We hope that all the hype will not spoil the ending.
