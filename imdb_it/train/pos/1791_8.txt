This is not a profound film; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true" but have been well interpreted and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the film calls them) as we look at our lives . I hadn't read the book, so I didn't know much about the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from a long time ago who didn't really share with anyone. Fortunately they have a first-rate cast .... Meryl, Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays the young Lila, and then Meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old Lila ... besides a surprising resemblance ( duh!) the younger actress did a great job (maybe not up to the caliber of her mother, but who is she?) All the others in this film were fine, although I'd like there to be more of Glen Close and I thought Buddy's character was a little too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more a movie for girls than for boys, but a good movie to watch with your mother, or your daughter, and maybe start talking. How difficult it is to really know a parent as a "person"!
