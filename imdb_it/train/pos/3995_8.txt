Kureishi was not exactly blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. Recent misrepresentations adapted as "Intimacy" have ruined the great writing. But the mother overcomes all her previous incarnations, even eclipsing My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman wins the widow with a very carnal relationship with her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe all this is due to the quality of the acting as the finished gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig we have an impetuous, brash, stern anti-hero who denies the public to question why a young stallion could contemplate a falling grandmother's bed. Beautifully filmed, the film fails only in the weak representation of peripheral characters, but as a study of an inconceivable desire, it is a winner.
