The Secret of Kells is a film I've been waiting for years after seeing some footage of Kilkenny's Cartoon Saloon. I'm here to tell you that the wait is now worth it. Cartoons are strongly stylized but not as annoying as I feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the illuminated animated book where small figures come to life on the page. The characterization is superb, I love the voice of Brendan Gleeson as the severe abbot and I particularly liked the voice of the Aisling sprite. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well done, a mix of reality and fantasy. and it really attracts the viewer to encourage Brendan in his search for the perfect materials for the Book. I am a calligraphy and lighting lover, so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen this and are not fans of the trade agree that it is a nice little movie. I will definitely buy the DVD when it is released, and I would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. There could be many more :) Going back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and given them for Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck of the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nomination.
