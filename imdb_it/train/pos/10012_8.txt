The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but it makes a very interesting character in a rather strange but very different film. I can guarantee you that you've never seen this type of film before. Some people may not like the slow pace of this film, but I think it's the great advantage of the film. It is certainly one of the best films released in 2006. It has an intriguing performance in a film with excellent content, a dramatic sensation. This is not an Americanized film. Nor is it a predictable film. You only have the feeling that it is a film that has secrets that you have difficulty determining what the result may be. This is not an excellent film that has it all, but hell, it's a damn good and very original film.
