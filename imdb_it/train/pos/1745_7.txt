How sincerely friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I enjoyed seeing old Lugosi. It is disarming, friendly and lively. It is the document of a lost trade. (Today's best TV series cannot compete with these moderately good old magazines.) CHANDU is deeply, profoundly optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind It is not stupid; those who do not have the terms on which these serials work are stupid. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much ?? Chandu is a Western sorcerer who also goes by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of assassins. <br /> <br /> Chandu exercises his supernatural gifts discreetly and moderately. <br /> <br /> As for the rather sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the Ubasti priest: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl in fact multiplies herself kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sleeping with a flower; almost abducted by a boat; by a fake policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange and frightening ceremonies recall the image of KING KONG and are a barbaric mockery of the ceremonies and rituals of the RCC. <br /> <br /> Would you protect a girl with the same dexterity as Chandu? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old lustful and rather ruthless, drunk villain, and this only contributed to his performances. It is the prototype of the drunk, mischievous, cunning and oblique uncle. This might seem a rather distorted tribute to Lugosi, yet Wood's Burton biopic left this impression on Lugosi and allied him with a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I like the imaginative interpretations of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This serial is unfairly struck.
