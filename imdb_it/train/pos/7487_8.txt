I really enjoyed this film because I have a huge interest in American history ... the Antebellum years and in particular the civil war. I recently bought it from a rack of videos previously seen for sale at the supermarket and I was very happy to add it to my collection of history videos. Although not of the caliber of Civil War films like "Glory" or "Gettysburg", it provides much history about the pre-Civil War brotherhood among the cadets at West Point. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the gray uniforms, the youth, or the military discipline, but I'm fascinated by the history of the Cadet Corps from about 1830 to the end of the war. I imagine how it must have been to be in a class with other young people, learn to make war, then put the lessons to use against your classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the film does not mention this fact, except for Henry A. DuPont, first May Class graduate; and George Custer, the last year of the June class. the reason for the two classes was not so much the war, but it was the result of the return to a four-year course of studies, after some years of experimentation of a course of five years (I think that the first lesson has had attended five years , the other for four). As the film portrays, the cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class of 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say this film is "Santa Fe Trail", as it should have been because that 1940 movie, while it was fun, was really a little muddy story. Cadets of different classes are all graduating together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as best friends and are side by side in stopping the John Brown uprising of 1859 at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. They confronted each other (for the first time, I believe) in Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was at the Harper ferry raid, but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it took place). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer has a role in "Class of '61", although his classmates, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictitious. I think they are based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can watch. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really like this movie or any movie that offers a window on mid-nineteenth century America.
