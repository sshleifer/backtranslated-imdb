It is a story of people from the Siberian village from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1960s. It speaks of passion and feelings, of the Russian soul and very romantic. This film is NOT full of action, it flows slowly. In the second part you can find great songs - Russian novels. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and created Runaway Train for example.
