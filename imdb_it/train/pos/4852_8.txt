Now this is one of Big's Best, the only role of Jack Hulbert in 1931 split in two for the Band Waggon Askey & Murdoch radio team. He boasts a great brave cast, who love the game for everything they are worth, especially Askey, of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, the melodramas of Herbert Lomas and the pragmatics of Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> The group of railway passengers stranded in the lonely country station for the night finds more than they expected, ghostly trains, ghostly carriers, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His blow and response to everyone falls between splitting the parts and dull ghostly. When the formula works it is very good, but sometimes it becomes very artificial and forced to make the film look older than it is. But those damned fifth columnist - thanks to any God Britain has none nowadays! <br /> <br /> After all, a nice, harmless film, to welcome the TV screen like an old friend, but if you expected to be shivering from your wood you will probably be very disappointed!
