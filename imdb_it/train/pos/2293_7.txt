This is a cartoon Bugs Bunny very, very soon. As a result, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not drawn as stretched as he was later and his voice is not right. Furthermore, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a bit poor who buys Bugs from a pet shop - there is no gun or wish on his part to blow the rabbit into a thousand pieces! However, despite this, this is still a very funny movie. The first bugs were definitely more blatant and cruel than his subsequent incarnations. In subsequent films, he messed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they messed up the rabbit. But, in this film, he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30s and early 40s - an idiot who just loves to annoy others !! A true "anarchist" instead of the next cartoon hero. While this is not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it's definitely fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much it has changed over the years.
