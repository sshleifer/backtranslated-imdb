Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward come together to make this modern noir film a winner. Of the three, I don't know who was the most interesting as they all offer good performances and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patric makes the narration in this noir, playing a former boxer and a mental patient. Wow, this is just an interesting guy! It sounds silly, but it's not. Ward is the loser, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co-conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes wrong. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in every movie. <br /> <br /> The film could be considered a bit of a downer for the average viewer, but I found it fascinating ... and I don't like depressing films normally. What I found was a kind of bizarre criminal film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is a rather unknown film that should not have this status because it is simply a good story and well done.
