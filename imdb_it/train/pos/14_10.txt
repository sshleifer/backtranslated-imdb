This film has a special place in my heart, as when I first got it, I taught adult literacy. It sounded very true to me and also an exceptional student I had at the time. There are scenes that make you fall in your throat with a sudden emotion, and those that make you even smile on your face through pure identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro who are classified with their best work, a great turning point by a young Martha Plimpton, a compelling storyline, and a musical score score make the experience more pleasant and rewarding.
