Many of the reviews and comments I've read on this film say this is a rather stale movie and performance by Clara Bow. Although the plot was rather typical of Clara's subsequent silences, I still find it quite moving and incredibly fun. Clara plays a carefree Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... it doesn't matter that this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking during the day, but I think it takes the sweetness and general enjoyment of the film. Although it is certainly not a brilliant plot (quite typical, actually), this film is a beautiful demonstration of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
