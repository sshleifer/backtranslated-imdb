The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - by collecting the footage from the Chinese owner who shares his shameless and delusional point of view, his American counterpart also as shameful and delirious, the oppressed workers who are given voice and obviously drunk Americans who wear beaded necklaces celebrating without worries in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are really outraged by the fact that the people who make their beaded necklaces have been paid as $ 0.10 an hour to do it. You also have the feeling that workers may have the chance to escape from the bead factory, but they will probably do so when they are fed up with the punitive treatment of the factory owner and / or feel too exhausted to work 20 hours a day of hard work. <br /> <br /> I wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how hard and arduous it would be to do them. I really enjoyed this film because it magnificently portrays the impact that American indulgence has on something we consider relatively harmless in our society about people on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just great. And of course, just the tip of the iceberg!
