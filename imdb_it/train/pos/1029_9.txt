I would have rated the series a perfect 10 for the exceptional and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10! <br /> <br /> The final episode of the tenth season "Unending", where (it would certainly seem that) Asgard was killed in a very hasty, unconvincing and very ceremonious way, he left me incredulous! <br /> <br /> From the extremely hasty end of the series, it is obvious that many of the narrative arcs were originally planned for at least another season. My hypothesis would be that they quickly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the next two direct-to-DVD moves! <br /> <br /> Unless Asgard returns to a future SG-1 movie (with an excellent explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I think the fans have been cheated with a bad cleaning of loose parts! <br /> <br /> Poor end to an otherwise brilliant science fiction series.
