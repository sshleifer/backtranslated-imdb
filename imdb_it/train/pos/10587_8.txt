This film is not schlock, despite the production and its connection with Troma productions. A dark tale for adults. The exploitation is a theme of Sugar Cookies and one wonders if the cast did not fall prey to this issue. A bizarre film with captivating images: shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth a look, especially for Warhol fans and elegant decadence. Through all the cruelty and wickedness, a moral, though twisted, can be resplendent.
