Here is the skinny, it seems to be much older than I thought. But it's still beautiful. Bike meches are fantastic and the story works for the most part. There are some problems with the characters that I hope will solve them from Part 2 and my biggest complaint of everything that appears to be a MACROSS knockout. Not just the style of animation but different designs of characters. For example, all the girls in this film look like LYN MINMAY from MACROSS. Mechs are similar to MACROSS and other characters. This is not done for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So long story short, I gave this awesome MACROSS 7 STARS knock-off.
