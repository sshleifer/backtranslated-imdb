Director Edward Sedgwick, an old visual comedy expert, successfully leads this Hal Roach road show that offers a fast and skillful scenario and excellent casting, employing a large number of Roach's reliable performers. Although the film was originally designed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, the sunny Jack Haley plays Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his repair and travel business in Hollywood, where he tries to play a role for the girl he loves, star -struck Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as his set, does it here as Cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by an aspiring paramour, the movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), to the action behind the scenes of, of course, a musical comedy, with the Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer several fun interludes, including their famous skit involving a tiny harmonica, and we look at the beautiful rounds of Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. On balance, the bays must be handed over to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the image as an emotional movie star, a role he largely creates, and the director for his skilful final homage to Busby Berkeley's film shows.
