After Fatih Akins' first work "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a truly wonderful Italian family epic. It is a German film, which unfortunately is a negative precondition, because we rarely produce more than moderate films;). But this film makes some great snapshots of the time back then. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant arriving in the "Ruhr" region of Germany in the 1960s. The immigrant and his family then started the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellent drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. Live every second, every feeling you make. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not so good. Well, you don't believe his role. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly into this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "The Godfather". Most people will probably hate this movie, they say it's boring. Not a lot of tension? - Yes, but an outrageous film. 9 out of 10.
