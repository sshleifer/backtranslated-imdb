In fact: drug use, warehouse shootings, "Matrix exotic bullets", a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races and a lone vampire - all in the same film - looks like a story that could only be imagined by a pop / rock star Japanese. And that's exactly what 'Moon Child' is, and more. While all these elements combined may seem like the perfect subject for a B-movie campy of the week, "Moon Child" pulls it off but with some bumps and hitches expected along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a gritty, decidedly independent appearance, jumping from one scene to another not in a fluid transition, but rather jumping occasionally, giving glimpses of the characters' lives and barely scraping a real plot. But the film makes no excuses, but turns the story into a story of friendship, love, trust and betrayal, all coated in sugar in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, gangster at war and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE as the gloomy vampire "Kei" is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing the overzealous acting of Gackt as "Sho", an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful "son" who becomes friends with an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods of their lives, and how simple friendship can easily be transformed into pain and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Even if the action is sometimes too unrealistic and special effects appear only to show off, one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular Asian singers it characterizes. Superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. The film rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after missing quite a bit. 'Moon Child' is quite funny, fun at times, and also very touching: it's definitely worth it!
