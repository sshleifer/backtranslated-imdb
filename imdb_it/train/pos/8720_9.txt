All of you who have despaired by looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of the latest Disney Studios productions, here is something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all, A Bug's life brings proof that purely synthetic images that lead a good scenery provides more interest than false hand-made designs like "Disneys-like" (see the Lion King, Pocahontas and all the latest productions that regret unfortunately that the magical background and atmosphere of Bambi have disappeared forever) . <br /> <br /> The life of an insect (1001 Pattes for my cinemaniak friends!) Can avoid all the imperfections that make you wake up in the middle of the film and say "Hey, this thing is computer generated! ". No weak part, an enormous effort that shows its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general appearance of the sets, a surprising 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality) ... and this is just to mention the technical aspects. > <br /> The scenery, my friends, the real backbone of a movie, has a certain thickness! Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life. Which means the story is long and rich enough to get rid of these 3 or 4 minutes that some children appreciate, but many others don't like (same thing for parents or anime fans, like me). This film reminded me of an old movie with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: the 3 Amigos; it basically had the same background story (an entire Mexican village that lives in fear of some villains hiring armed men (who eventually turn into actors) to protect them, etc ...). Simple but efficient and brilliantly adapted to a colony of scared ants that faces the wrath of vicious insects. <br /> <br /> Since Microcosm, many films tell insects stories, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think the life of an insect is the most fun and the most direct of all. The humanization process has been perfectly realized ... And the whole audience was fascinated by the adventures of Flik (aka Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> A big thank you for the Lasseter team, especially for the last 30 seconds. .. it is so strange and beautiful at the same time to see a whole theater taken in a laugh while the insects / actors forget their lines or they hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those of you who saw the French version, other congratulations go to the voice actors who have done a great job of synchronizing on this film. The life of a bug is really a nice piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my video collection (a privilege granted to very few movies, and this is not a stock issue :). Go see it, this is an order.
