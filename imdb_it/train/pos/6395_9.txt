For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. By overcoming racism, fighting for life and proving not to be a simple "biscuit", Carl Brashear is an extraordinary character to interpret, that puts Cuba in its best light, the best performance of his life. De Niro, which is a living legend, it gives SOMETHING SOMETHING to the film. He played his character in the film, but he gives so much acting to this film, great performances. And the appearance of the beautiful Charlize was and how it is always a great advantage for every film. So, if you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it to those who love courage, the greatness that seeks inspiration. You have to watch this great drama. My vote 9/10.
