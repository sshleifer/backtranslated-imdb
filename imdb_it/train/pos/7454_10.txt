** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only got a Gamecube in September 2005 and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, Agent Agent Under Fire and the opaque Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I had planned was All or Nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had. I must say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it for a tenner in HMV, and when I got home, I threw it in my Cube and played it for hours and hours. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. The graphics were among the best I've seen (but now that XBOX 360 is out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The plot was intelligent; crazy (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and a beautiful woman (Heidi Klum, called Katya Nadanova), tries to destroy the world with small nanobots, that at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, must destroy a train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's tits. You must therefore counter their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The nice thing about this game is that it actually has actors that give characters a voice, like Cleese donating Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them quite long and complicated. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a grand total of 90%
