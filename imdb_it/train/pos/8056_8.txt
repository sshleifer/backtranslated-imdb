This 1935 photo moved away with all kinds of Ocar for the best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and Max Seiner's music. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), "Call Out the Marines", 42, gave an exceptional performance as an Irish rebel that had belonged to a harsh and tough crowd that fought for a cause and at the same time became increasingly poor and poor with a lot to drink. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend to take a trip with his girlfriend to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary", '43, gave a great supporting role as leader of the Irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informant of his group. Gypo Nolan becomes haunted by his friend's betrayal and begins to feel just like a Judas. Great movie for 1935 and wonderful acting by McLaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the film.
