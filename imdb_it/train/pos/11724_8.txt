Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the guest of an economic horror show. After discovering that her deceased aunt left her some stuff, Elvira goes to England to pick her up, hoping there is money. But to her horror, Elvira discovers that her whole aunt has left her home, her dog and a cookbook. Elvira decides to settle down at home anyway, but with her dark looks and extraordinary features, she won't be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are now turning the whole city against her, and with the outrageous attitude of Elvira, everyone should be careful, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to see Elvira in all these adventures, it's just fantastic. The whole movie puts you in a mood of Halloween, sure, it's silly and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to watch it. Darei Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
