This is simply one of the best interpretations of Dicken's classic story. The script accurately follows the story originally written by Dickens and captures a perfect balance between a cinematic atmosphere and a gaming atmosphere. Enthusiastic viewers of both formats will find enough of the plot rooted in their preferred presentation style. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott offers a delightfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and is very convincing in the development of the character instigated by the ghost visits. I discovered that he was able to win me over to the point where I was sympathetic to the old miser, something that was rarely done in other versions. The superb work done by the supporting actors adds a lot to this production, which is simply the most fun of all the versions of Christmas Carol I've seen.
