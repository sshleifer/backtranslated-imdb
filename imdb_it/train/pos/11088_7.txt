The villian in this film is an average hiccup and seems to enjoy what he is doing, this is what I imagine makes him so bad. I don't think most men will like this movie, especially if they have ever betrayed their wife. This is one of those movies that pretty much remains pretty bad until the end. But then, here it is, a finale at the bar that makes me look back and say "HOKIE AS HELL." A good film to the end. The end is the ending that we would like to see but not the end of such a petty beginning. And then there are the consequences of what happened. I guess you can decide for yourself on the true ending. I thought that only one character would survive the end.
