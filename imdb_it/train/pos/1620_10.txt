So wonderful, so eccentric, so romantic, so Italian. The film is as light as the feather that floats in its refracted reality and you don't want to go back to the umbrum. A world of kitchen sinks of bakeries, hairdressers and plumbers, but one that shines with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the script or director? Make your choice - they are both impeccable. Let me go back to that New York City that is just beyond the mirror.
