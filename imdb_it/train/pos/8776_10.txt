Just to mention another thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the evaluations that make him one of Errol Flynn's biggest releases in a career of great releases. I would think that this role played by the boxer Jim Corbett is more like his true swordsman character with which he was typed. Flynn looked like a party animal from his memories and he was a boy whose real life was more exciting than his life on screen. The extra thing I wanted to emphasize is to note the great montages, transitions and inserts that dot the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent Flynn collaborator, with cinematographer Sid Hickox, the montages were made by an emerging publisher named Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel went so far, but it is listed in the credits. He would embark on a great career as an action director.
