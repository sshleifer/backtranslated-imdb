As if most people do not already have a nervous perspective in the field of dentistry, this little film will surely make you contend with paranoid patients. A successful dental hygienist testifies that his wife descends on the pool man (on the occasion of their everyday anniversary!) And takes a long time in a violent collapse. After shooting an attack dog, he sets to work and ends up marital attack on patients while planning what to do with his wife "bitch". There are lots of close-ups of jabbing, tongue cuts and beauty hairstyle, plus a wonderfully unbalanced performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he binds and gases to his wife before ripping out his teeth without mercy is definitely difficult to look at. A dentist is absolutely the wrong type of person to freak out and this film certainly explains it in detail. "The Dentist" is incredibly fun, fast, and ridiculously gory at times. Check it out!
