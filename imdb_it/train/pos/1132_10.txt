His Hollywood mimics the Daytiem Soap Opera at its best! It's the fun we never see. Big characters and big lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so exaggerated .... Gary Marshalls' lines are a riot ... that's what I love about good comedies. Never afraid to make fun of yourself !!!!!! The sets were fantastic ... the wardrobe was on the dot and the stab behind "Montana Morehead" was a diabolical delight. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but no less wonderful and funny when she is on the screen. I'd like to know how the idea for this film came about. I've never seen a cast of people have so much fun making comedies! Soapdish is a must and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
