Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual earning a living as a waiter in "Grand Slam", directed by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly fun satire in building the celebrity. The waiter and the girl in the hat-solo of the Russian restaurant played by Loretta Young become America's lovers as bridge partners who don't make fuss. With the help of the advertiser and ghost writer "Speed" McCann (the wonderful Frank McHugh) they become itinerant advertisements <br /> for the "Stanislavsky system", a "system" of offer whatever the feeling <br /> <br /> (since the offers are not rational, there are no grounds for recriminations about their stupidity). <br /> <br /> A duel with the guru of the evacuated bridge Cedric Van Dorn (he plays near Goren, no? and I suspect that the choice of the name of the character "Stanislavsky" was also a crush in another type of system ), a quack inflated very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations throughout America as a prize fight by Roscoe Karns (another fantastic comedian with a clear tone from the 1930s). <br /> <br /> Bridge players are also in a string square, even if the audience is above them, unlike the audience in boxing "rings". <br /> <br /> The wide variety of American types foreshadows the plays of Preston Sturges, although for manufacturing celebrity, "Grand Slam" most of them bring to mind two better films of the same period (pre-Code) with Lee Tracy playing fast-talking publicists <br /> <br />: "The Half-Naked Truth" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has its <br /> moments, especially for those he played bridge with tip checkers <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clothes horse. (To me, her face looks a little long <br /> and horsey, too. Another beauty concept of the time, I suppose ...) The movie <br /> <br /> unfortunately all but Glenda Farrell, who plays McHugh's forgetful girl <br /> <br />.
