Many reviews here explain the story and characters of "Opening Night" in detail, so I won't. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life. <br /> <br /> At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how easy it was to act when she was 17, when she was youthful and energetic and felt she knew the truth. The experience left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life was and, indeed, if she could even continue to live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour he rediscovers the power of his art and reaffirms ("I must bury that bastard", he says of comrade actor Maurice as he takes the stage). It seems almost sadistic when the director of Myrtle prevents people from helping her when she gets drunk hopelessly for her first performance. He knows, however, that he must have the courage to do it alone, if he wants to do it. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is only a temporary pause on Myrtle's downhill course. I think this is really his "opening night" - he opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, he sees a way to follow. It is tremendously moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is superb. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
