Splendid film that in just eight minutes shows an unusual mix of genres: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we are authorized to tell the story: a girl enters a European coffee shop and then ... Soft transit from meaningless mystery to narrative logic. In no time, no place where Vigalondo managed a B / W delight through imagination and despite (thanks to) the tightest budget. <br /> <br /> Because of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, land of rapid poetry in B / W (¿recalls the first Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> A must see to reassure our belief in young cinema outside the United States.
