Both my friend and I thought this film was well done. We were expecting a light comedy but we got a full-fledged action movie with comical thrusts. We both thought that this film might not have worked so well at the box office because the previews led us to believe it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse has always done a great job of acting. Most of the support cast are not veterans and are solid. We both felt that the drafting and directing was of the highest quality and we commented on the purchase of this film. If you don't buy it, rent it for a good time.
