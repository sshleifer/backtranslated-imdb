from the point of view of a NASCAR maniac like me, the film is interesting. You can see a lot of racing cars since 1983. Also tough, the racing scenes are not so realistic. But I have to admit that I didn't see any races before 1995, because before that they hadn't shown NASCAR races in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the perspective of a Burt Reynolds fan I am, the film is basically what we are used to seeing from Reynolds in the 1980s: Burt driving a fast car, like in his Bandit movies. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this film is a must see. If you love only one of these two things, I also suggest you look at it. If you don't like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a chance, but remember, this film was far from winning an Oscar Academy. <br /> <br /> It is the typical humor of the 80s. If you like movies like Cannonball movies and the Police Academy, you'll like that too.
