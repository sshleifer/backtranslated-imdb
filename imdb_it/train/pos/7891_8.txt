Now all the children and adolescents of Springwood, Ohio, are all dead to expect for a teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert Englund) lets him go and the teenager doesn't have much of a memory when he arrives in a new city. When a tough psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break the new patient. She finds out where she comes from. She takes him to Springwood to spark some memories but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan), who came unexpectedly for the ride. Once in Springwood, the psychologist has a memory that he lived in that city before he was a child. While Freddy knows the real secret of his true identity. <br /> <br /> Directed by Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) has made a dark sequel but a bit strangely different with a visual style and funny moments for this horror / fantasy / thriller of. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a supporting role as a psychology expert on dreams. This has some brilliant visual effects (not everyone will love the climax, especially in 3-D) and some good style in its narrative. This film produced some of the movie's box office series. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a strong anamorphic widescreen transfer (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan) and a strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD contains the original theatrical trailer, a nightmare opinion and information on Cast & Crew. The "Elm Street" series box set, the eighth disc, contains interviews with the cast and crew of this sixth film. The sixth movie is also 3-D for the climax of the film, but you can also watch it in 2-D. This is the last "Elm Street" movie until Wes Craven resurrected Freddy in a different and darker style in "New Nightmare" and in the silly but surprisingly horror movie "Freddy Vs Jason". Watch Robert Shaye (Co-owner and co-CEO of "New Line Cinema"), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in funny cameos. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter's In the mouth of madness). From a story of the director. (*** Â½ / *****).
