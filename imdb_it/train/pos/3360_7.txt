One day in May 1938, when a great rally celebrates Hitler's visit to Rome, it is the backdrop to a love story between Antoniette (Sophia Loren) married to the fascist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcello Mastroianni). She is a boring housewife with several children and is an unhappy and lonely homosexual shot from the radio and chased by the fascists. She remained alone in her home when her spouse had to attend the historical celebration. So both develop a very pleasant relationship despite their differences. The film is set in the historic meeting between Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini together with other authorities such as Count Ciano and King Vittorio Emanuele III, describing the events with a radio voice that is sometimes irritating. <br /> <br /> It is a romantic drama made with sense and sensitivity. A passionately passionate story between two conflicting characters. Magnificent performances by two professionals make a splendid film worth seeing. Obviously Ruggero Macarri and the sensitive screenplay by Ettore Scola are always interesting, elaborate and sentimental. The colorful and suggestive cinematography of Pascualino De Santis. The emotional soundtrack of Armando Trovajoly with a sensitive leitmotiv. The film deservedly won Golden Globes 1978 for best foreign film. <br /> <br /> Scola's imagination extends to illuminate the limited scenarios in which the drama develops. Usually his films take place in some phases and are semi-theatrical. For example: "Le Bal" (1982) uses a French ballroom to illustrate changes in society 2) "Nuit of Varennes (1983) a diligence is the setting in which to meet an unlikely group such as Thomas Paine, Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette escaped from the revolutionary Paris 3) "The family" (1987) are all held in the great Roman apartment of the family, and of course 4) ¨A Particular Day¨ or ¨ A special day where Loren and Mastroianni meet a wonderful relationship in their respective apartments and on the flat roof.
