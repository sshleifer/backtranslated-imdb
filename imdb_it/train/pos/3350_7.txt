I don't remember ever seeing this before tonight, probably the title seemed so normal to pass me. But it is a well done b western, with an interesting plot that compliments the acting from the good to the more mushy. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum leans in a large city in search of his wife and his daughter, and remains for a time as a city tamer. As usual, good businessmen have mixed emotions: they want to get rid of the bad guys, but like the business they bring. It still applies: read the laws on beverages and gambling and encourage industries, but pretend to deplore the sordid effects it can have on ordinary people. The fascinating thing about this film is the cynical interpretation of Mitchum in cleaning up the city of villains, and the acceptance by the citizen that his violent methods were the only ones. Favorite well: the sudden disappearance of 2 of the villains in the Red Dog salon. The main salon fire bordered by ugly, but was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Overall a very good film with its only fault that tends to be a bit of hokeyness - not so good for Do-Gooders who would probably prefer a life of negotiation with Evil rather than finish.
