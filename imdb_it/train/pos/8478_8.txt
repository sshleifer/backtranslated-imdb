I saw this film as a child and it broke my heart! No other story had such an incomplete ending ... I grew up in many great anime films and this was one of my favorites, because it was so unusual: a story about injustice, cruelty, loneliness, life and choices that cannot be canceled and need for others. Chirin is made by himself when the Wolf kills his mother, but even the Wolf is only when Chirin follows him into the mountain. The wolf doesn't kill the lamb, even if every night he says "maybe I'll eat you tomorrow". The tape I have is broken and degraded by age and use. I will repair it and watch the film again one day and I will cry with the same hardness as when I was a child. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this complexity of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never seen any catharsis done more beautifully. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
