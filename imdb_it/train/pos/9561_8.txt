'' Ranma Â½ "is my favorite anime of Rumiko Takahashi, the woman really knows how to entertain us with a beautiful story, which is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also a martial arts expert, Ranma is engaged to Akane due to an agreement of both fathers, who are great friends and have been training together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and Tendo's violent sister: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the medium and loves winning money, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane are fighting all the time, especially because both have a very bad temperament , and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when he is sprayed with cold water and his father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations start to happen and they also discover the reason for the transformation: while he fights, Ranma and his father fell into a river but but, not only they had this kind of destiny ... <br /> <br /> If you looked at "Ranma 1/2" and liked it, I would recommend "Inuyasha" and "Maison Ikkoku", two other good Rumiko's hand creations.
