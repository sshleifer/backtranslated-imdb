I had begun to lose faith in the recently-filmed films that were flooded with the typical Hollywood genre movie. The story lines fail and the camera work is simply copied from the last film of similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical plot compelling, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you through an enchanted journey at every step and involves you in Europe 1945. We have seen death appear on the screen in hundreds of ways, but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moment that takes you to death. Unlike many movies, it doesn't cut a second after showing (for example) a knife but forces you to look at the devastating yet sensual beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all take something different from what this film is trying to say, but it's definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. I'd like to talk more about the film for anyone who wants to send me an email. Have fun!
