For anyone who has seen the beautifully animated version of Disney Productions's "Beauty & The Beast", or even the surreal vision of Jean Cocteau's fairy tales will be completely surprised by this French version of 1975 (but with a Polish director). The plot concerns a fading French aristocratic family who is marrying into a wealthy English family. The main problem is that the groom is bringing an ancient curse on the family. The film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) that explain this family curse. From the opening credits to the end, this is an almost uninterrupted erotic entertainment round, with some VERY explicit and graphic sexual contents (hence the X evaluation of the film in the US in its initial run, which is now unrated) ). The somewhat contemptuous feeling of the film in the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel's flights in similar territory. If you have a taste for the real bizarre, and you are not offended by the "taboo" material, then this movie could scratch that itch for you.
