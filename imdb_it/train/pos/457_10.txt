This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so captivating that I can't get it out of my head. I find that as I get older I am attracted by the wrinkles that do things, and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now, with our PC world, we would never be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and some forensic work, you will love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in one way and Barney Miller in another the way they work and interact with each other. They ruin a lot but get the job done, and that's what counts.
