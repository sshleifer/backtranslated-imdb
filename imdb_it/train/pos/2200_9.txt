The 100 half-hour black and white episodes of the comedy of the first "Mr. Peepers" series were originally broadcast from 1952-55 to NBC. Like many baby boomers, this and "Ding Dong School" are my first memories of television. Since both were later published in syndication, it is difficult to say how many of these memories are actually related to the original broadcasts. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is worth taking a look at something more than its nostalgic value. It represents a very different style of comedy than the situation compared to shows like "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the noisy and abrasive path of those two shows; which is probably why they still seem contemporary. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers", which differed in its intelligent and discreet tone, may seem slow and boring by comparison. But it's really more a question of adapting to the different style. Once inside the characters, most smart viewers will win. The credit should be given to the producer of the show, Fred Coe, a key figure of the first television, whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producers Showcase "," Playwrights "56", "Fireside Theater", etc.) Also on the picture tube. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" offered a much nicer style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of " Underdog "a few years later" in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a mild high school science teacher whose glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and passive observer role. <br /> < br /> The series provided Cox with an exceptional support cast Tony Randall played his best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the noisy gymnastics teacher whose mild bullying has given the show most of its conflict elements. <br /> <br /> There is some competition of love interest involving the school nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), with spectators quickly lining up with Mr. Peepers who looks like a much better game for sweet Nancy. Their on-screen marriage towards the end of the 1953-54 season caught national attention, one of the first versions of "Who Shot J.R.?" frenzy. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
