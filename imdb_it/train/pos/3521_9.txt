Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" comments a reviewer regarding Elisha Cook's drum episode, obviously powered by a cocaine. This was a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some praise for his frantic performance. <br /> <br /> A bit of a curiosity that I am making fun of: Cook appeared as a waiter in Barbara Stanwyck's 1941 film, "Ball of Fire". He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara was singing and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa played the drum, most vigorously. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's bubbly battery in the next film, "Phantom Lady", was very much inspired by Krupa's work, as witnessed by Cook 3 years earlier? <br /> <br /> If you look at Krupa in "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice some clearly similar body movements. It is hoped, of course, that HE was not affected by any drugs at that time!
