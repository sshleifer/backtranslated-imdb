I noticed that the DVD version seems to have lost scenes or lines between the release of the FRF and the launch. <br /> <br /> They must show that they can win the right to sit in the FRF in addition to the green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene is how during their simulation failure, Kevin gets Joaquin to curl up. <br /> <br /> I think the VHS edition other than the ABC could have all the things missing. <br /> <br /> Otherwise I'd like to know which version of the DVD has things missing. <br /> <br /> The DVD I saw feels modified for television.
