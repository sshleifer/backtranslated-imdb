A delightful piece of film storytelling in a simple but effective way. The cinema, after all, is a visual support and Igor has fully exploited its potential. A restless young man gets on a train without a destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets a girl. The words are not exchanged but their laundry is washed and from there we are carried around with other characters and special situations. The two protagonists are perfectly expressed because their unique characteristics tell you a story that needs no words.
