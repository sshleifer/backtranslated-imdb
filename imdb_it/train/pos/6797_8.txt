Some negative reviews for this and I understand why, but I consider it a low-cost serial killer movie and you could get more out of it than most. <br /> <br /> I thought this worked a certain way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that it's a certain degree of success isn't it? <br /> <br /> I would say that there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under the skin even if the acting is perhaps a little too irregular. David Hess is alone in this brielfy so don't fool yourself if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> Besides that, it's worth a look.
