A solid B film. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its sober delivery is refreshing at a time of superior performance. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamics. The Wendigo seems silly, but it is a representation of the child's toy and the dead deer. It's a fusion like, see? This is a psychological story, not a shot by Freddy that implies the instant hit of gratification. Watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might need to tell you and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> Good work.
