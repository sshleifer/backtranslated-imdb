As I watched this movie I started feeling very nostalgic. As a child growing up in a rural area, I felt like a kid again! The swimming pond (called "reservoir" in central Texas), crosses the countryside like a wild free spirit! The story was very credible and I totally lost it and cried towards the end. Through the pain we go through in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
