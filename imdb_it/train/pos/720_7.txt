Imagine what the school would have been like in a world like this: children are a great band that has really good taste for music and joins bad directors and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" is unfolding in that world. It's like a Ramones record that comes to life. The characters are all silly, innocent and fascinating like the Ramones songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare a film like "American Pie" with this classic from the 70s, where you don't absolutely have sex without taste. Since a remake is apparently in the works, it is likely that the charm of the original will be lost along the way and will be replaced by vulgar, half-funny jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones CANNOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close and take their place. So the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, however extravagant and fascinating as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
