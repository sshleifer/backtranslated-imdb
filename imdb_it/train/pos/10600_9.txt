This is a very entertaining Ealing play about a community in central London that, through an unusual set of circumstances, discovers that they are not English, but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> The features of the film are the comedian Stanley Holloway (better known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as a series of other classic comic actors of the period. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on news at the time, when the Canadian government "officially" gave a European hotel member a royalty room for a hotel room. The idea actually reminded me of the case of the real life of the Hutt River province in Western Australia, where a landowner "separated" from the Australian government due to a dispute over wool quotas. (It was never recognized by the Australian or Western Australian governments). <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic script that plays with a lot of political and economic problems, rather like the "Yes Minister" TV show; besides being a small eccentric character.
