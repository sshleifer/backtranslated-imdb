This review is for the extended cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I've always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> Having said that. I've always found the plot a bit confusing. The film is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20-minute fight scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version this is no longer the case. The old "original" version starts with a huge barrel-climb / rugby sequence which is the new final sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) who wanders around his house and pretends to train and act whenever his father is around. <br /> <br /> Also other sequencers have been moved or extended in the extended cut and the plot makes a lot more sense when you look at it. The pace is even better and overall it works better. It looks more like a love story and leaves you no question as to why it ends up drastically and dramatically like in the normal version. <br /> <br /> I suggest to all those who are a Hong Kong cinema, or just the simple Jackie Chan fan to get an extended version of the version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended (or at least this is the way I think it was intended.) Why else would they do it and reset some scenes? I finished watching it, I seemed to have seen a completely new Jackie Chan movie, even though most of the sequences were the same.
