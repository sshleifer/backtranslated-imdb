Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", the claims and counter-claims about how Episode II and III will present themselves have brought the spotlight to the "original" films of Star Wars, making them part of an ensemble cohesive, rather than segregating old and new films into separate trilogies. What the new films have done is allow new perspectives for older films. This new perspective allows us to better appreciate what has often been considered the weakest of the original trilogy: "The return of the Jedi". Often derided for its overly "cute" factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Strikes Back". In fact, the "cute" element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas put hairy films into the film just for the merchandising possibilities? Only he can answer this question. <br /> <br /> This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND the evolution of the saga. After the conclusion of "The Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his friends from the Rebel Alliance to Tatooine, his homeworld, to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned into a rebel hero captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts. <br /> <br /> Skywalker is a changed man since he left Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire. Now wrapped all in black, Luke's discovery of his origins left him confused and torn. His psychological makeup is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. While he might always aim to assist his rebellious friends, he craves another chance to face the evil Darth Vader again, despite his insecurity about whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader on the side Emperor. br /> <br /> The first scenes of Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's den, to his floating palace and to the "almighty Sarlac" - an intenstino who lives in the sand. The improvements made by Lucas to the CGI in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of Sarlac, making it fake and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The battle scene on Tatooine is exceptional, and is one of the most memorable of the saga movie. Luke practically killed only Jabba and his cronies, proving that his Jedi skills are almost complete. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the suffering Yoda once again, the viewer is disappointed by Yoda's distinct lack of chronology. Undoubtedly the star of "The Empire Strikes Back", Yoda is almost erased from history as the progression of Luke's fate is projected onto the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is really Luke's movie, maybe even more than the original. His journey brings the film as he approaches his confrontation with Darth Vader and his destiny. The other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The love story between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is almost non-existent, unlike "Empire". In fact, only the character of Leia is developed in ROTJ, the character of Solo seems to vanish when the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are consigned to working together with the rebels to destroy a new Death Star approaching completion. This time the Emperor himself is supervising the final stages of the construction. The Empire intends to defeat the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself intends to bring the powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is this the substitute?) Darth Vader. The emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less shrewd than the governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) of "Star Wars", more deeply psychologically obscure than anything else. Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. Hamill surprises Luke more wisely, advancing his character from a whiny teenager, an impatient student to an enlightened warrior one of the few real developments in the series. Ford's role is subtle, because all his charm and charisma were spent in the first two films - he was the real star of the first film, after all. Leia by Fisher is more of a prop, at least until the end of the film where she learns things about her that she was never sure of ... Add to favorites like Alec Guiness like Kenobi, Yoda and the lovely Chewbacca, C -3PO and R2D2 and the series looks more like a family than a cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the tough forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three-way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very special effects impressive. Music, as always, is brilliant and perfectly captures the atmosphere on every occasion. Just like the "Blue Danube" worked perfectly for "2001: A Space Odyssey", John Williams' score is part of "Star Wars" folklore like light sabers and Force. <br /> <br /> Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, in the sense that there would be more episodes made. In fact, science fiction fans have created their own versions of episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again. ROTJ works when a chance is given, and the furry cute animals aside are a good end to the series. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes can be seen together, this saga could be the best ever made. Is already? The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series. This is why "Return of the Jedi" can now be seen in a different light and receive a new appreciation almost 20 years after its release.
