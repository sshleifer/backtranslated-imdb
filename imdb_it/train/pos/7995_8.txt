Here is a story of feisty revenge, from the ways to the villains with an inexorable and crude Denzel Washington. Here are three personalities: a drunken mercenary, a poor and humble mercenary, then a loving person like a father to a child and then a brutal maniac in search of answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for an American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings occur regularly (at least according to the film). Become attached to the child, played with a modern-day childish actress game, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington chases responsible men and spares no one. Attention: this film is not for the picky. <br /> <br /> This is an elegant film, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too hectic for their tastes, since working with the camera is what could give you a headache. I thought it would fit the tense plot and it was fascinating to see, but it's (the camera flickering) not to everyone's taste. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, there is always the interesting Christopher Walken, in an unusual low-profile role, and a series of other good actors. <br /> <br /> The film supports the basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
