This is, in my opinion, a great movie, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. Contains a drug message, extraordinary special effects and a fantastic music video. <br /> <br /> The main film focuses on the song and the music video "Smooth Criminal". Unlike the four-minute music video, it's normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather strange, however. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" who, when he sees a shooting star, turns into a machine. In the course of the film, it turns into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The robot scene in particular is a bit drawn and strange. I found it a bit out of place compared to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> A child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot that detonates all the bad guys. Kinda weird? Yes. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the bizarre robot scene, it's a very nice film, and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
