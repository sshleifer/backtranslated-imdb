The sequels almost never survive the original. This is certainly true in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, definitely give this watch. Although the camera work is lacking, the character of Brian Krause is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more fun than the first and that's what I find funny about it. <br /> <br /> I don't see this movie waiting for the same performance as the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, Stanley went to Hollywood trying to direct his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This film looks very different, but it's still nice to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I'm giving him a 6 out of 10.
