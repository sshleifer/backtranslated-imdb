Freddy Krueger, the dream hunter of Elm Street, returns, the great character actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel to nightmare 5, son of dreams. I hope I got the number correctly. They were so many, and this is one of the best, especially for the cameos of: Rosanne Barr (then Arnold), tom Arnold, johnny depp, (who did the very first nightmare in 84) alice cooper (singer) you'll see Freddy as a tormented child, a teenager who loves pain, and like a (disturbing) family boy the effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister), the brat Meyer (road trip) yaphet kotto (alien , I live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (her father knows better) I was one of the people who saw this in 3d, very well the ending. I love 3D movies. I lost the first 3D wave of 1953 (I wasn't born yet) the second wave was in 1983. I like all Freddy's movies. this stands out as one of the best without counting the first that was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s, along with Jason voorhees, chucky, Micheal myers and the face in leather. Can you imagine a movie with all of them? I recommend it to all Freddy fans and horror fans. That of Freddy is somewhat resized.8 out of 10.
