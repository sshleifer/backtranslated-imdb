Hard to believe, perhaps, but this film has been denounced as immoral by more pulpits than any other film produced before the imposition of the Hayes bluenoso Code. Yes, indeed the priests told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film committed a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I'm not inventing anything. They had several reasons, as follows: <br /> <br /> Item: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treehouse. He relaxes sensually, and with a flirtatious look says "Tarzan, you were a bad boy!" So they didn't just have sex, they had eccentric sex! Some years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) were not to be portrayed as sex lovers. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane prefers a guilty, if wise and resourceful, savage (Tarzan) to a civilized man, respectable from nine to five (Holt). When Holt startles her with a nice London dress, she falters a little; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both believe he died, she staggers a lot. But when she realizes that her man is very much alive, the attractions of civilization vanish for her. Why not? The relationship between Tarzan and Jane is egalitarian: he lacks the "civil" insecurity that would force him to assert himself as "his wife's boss". To boot, he lacks many "civilized" grudges, for example jealousy. When Holt and his friend arrive, Tarzan greets them both cordially, knowing perfectly well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt makes her dress in a London dress and slowly dances with her to a portable phonograph, Tarzan comes out of a tree and draws his knife. Jealous? No. He is only cautious of the strange musical machine, since he has never seen one before. Once explained, it is strong. <br /> <br /> Article: Civilized Holt is dirty with mind. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. While Jane slips into Holt's flashlighted tent, Holt escapes to watch her silhouette as she transforms into a costume. On the contrary, after Tarzan has taken off his dress, he kicks her in the swimming hole and dives behind her, following the naked scene more elegantly erotic than the whole cinema: the couple spend five minutes in a ballet of water adorable. shot in three versions - clothes, topless and naked - the scene was cut before the film was released, but the naked version is restored in the video now available. And when Jane emerges, and Cheetah the chimp steals her dress just to tease, Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their speeches. Where is the "universal prurenza" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? Nowhere, that's where. Another reason why the refit considered this film a sin. <br /> <br /> Object: The idea that man is the crown of creation, and animals are here only for the use and comfort of man, suffers a heavy blow. Holt and his friend want to be guided to the "elephant graveyard" so that they can collect the ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to guide them to the cemetery. You, reader, are thinking "Fat chance!" and you're right. He is shocked. He exclaims "Elephants are sleeping!" which to him explains everything. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings that the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane, the former civilized woman, is much more enterprising than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and friend blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. It's Jane who keeps it fresh. While the boys panic, he takes the lead, barks orders and turns off the rifles. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane's costume is a kind of poncho with nothing underneath. (The original idea was that she was topless, with foliage that artistically blocked her nipples, which is true in a short scene.) <br /> <br /> Finally, many fabric men complained that the film was called "Tarzan and his companion" rather than "Tarzan and his wife". No comment! <br /> <br /> Obviously, Tarzan, who was well cared for by his monkey-like friends, comes to the rescue, routs the white hunters, and induces the herd of African elephants and porters to return the ivory they stole from the sacred place from which it came. The end. <br /> <br /> So you have it. An absolutely subversive film. Like all the other films on complex and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey) which was such a fluid genre in the early 1930s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of Hays Code. <br /> <br /> The joy of living in this film is best expressed with Jane's soprano version of the famous cry Tarzan. A nice touch, which unfortunately was abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
