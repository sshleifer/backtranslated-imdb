Super Speedway is a fantastic demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel audio system. The IMAX camera puts you in the race car, where you ride far and wide on various high-speed tracks, reminiscent of the Grand Prix's driving sequences (if that were to appear on DVD!). I like watching it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only downside, and the reason I didn't give it a 10, is that some driving sequences seem suspiciously as if the movie was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief: all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear swooshes as you go under the bridges.
