This is as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with its outrageous behavior and clothes, and the film was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see much more this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd in the role of Kevin, the rather clumsy male protagonist. Using Paris as the climax of the film was a brilliant idea. It is worth watching the movie whatever your age, as long as you like animals.
