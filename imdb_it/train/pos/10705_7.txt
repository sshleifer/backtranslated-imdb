The trailer for this film did not do the film justice. And while the film didn't know what he really wanted to go through, the first half of the film was a light and romantic comedy and the second had a more serious and romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it was. This film was more of a dating film, but the trailer became more of a suspense thriller that never showed up. Kidman, being one of my favorites, obviously I'm biased, but this film turned out to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat bizarre, film that deserved better. Three stars out of four. 9.5.02.
