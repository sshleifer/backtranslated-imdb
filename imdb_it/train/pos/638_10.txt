For anyone who thinks this show is not for them, please try it. Network television has degenerated into clone shows of clones or reality-based shows that often show unreal people. This show is a return to family-oriented TV where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are, and maybe even learning a little about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in today's entertainment world, and is perfectly launched as the young and somewhat naive new hitter for the imaginary New York Empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the main cast and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to be seen and seen. I hope it stays for a few seasons and we can watch Pete Young (the character of Sumpter) learn and grow.
