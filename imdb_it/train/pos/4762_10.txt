I thought "The River of Souls" was a great movie on Babylon 5, with some outstanding performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this was an episode of the series (without humor) it would probably be one of my favorite stories in the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although I was allowed JMS didn't sign it for most of the series and had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If you bring out the immoderate humor of the brothel and the "poor" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favorite of the four films, but not bad at all.
