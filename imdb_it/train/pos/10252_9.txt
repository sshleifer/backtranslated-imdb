After seeing "Guinea Pig", two questions come to mind (besides "Am I really a psychopath to watch it?"): "Is it a snuff?" The answer is no ; even if it's the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then: "Where the hell did they find that girl?" Because it is tortured for 45 minutes, without any given reason (in fact, there is nothing else in this film!): The nails are torn, beaten with hands, feet, instruments, infested with worms, ... and many others up to the final scene (I'm still not sure how they did it). Because it belongs to the "secluded Japanese scene", it is obvious that it did not receive much money. So what were his (their) motivations? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it is not a problem (no real dialogue, the boys are only offending it in some scenes). I haven't seen the whole serial yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" isn't known for being the best. However I voted 8, because if the purpose was to make people believe that this was taboo, the problem is quite good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie I'm hiding from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
