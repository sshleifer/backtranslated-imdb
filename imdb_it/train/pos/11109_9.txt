The Sopranos stands out as a hermetic and dynamic exploration of American life, and of how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting the story in the underworld, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, to the ground and to the direct deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents an aspect of American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies the besieged rigid work, split between family duty and the need to keep his "business" in balance. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that moves the story forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby reflect the loyal - but submissive egoists present in every business, who trust by necessity rather than by merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who is flourishing in violence are tragically overcome by his extraordinary earning power. And Dominic Chianese is the supreme symbol of the antiquated old guard, who maintains power through established relationships and the need for up-and-comers to divert the blame. <br /> <br /> Although abrasive and occasionally disturbing, The Sopranos has earned its place as the last television drama. <br /> <br /> PS A good piece to accompany the Chase series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest character interesting.
