I've loved this movie since it came out. I was about nine years old and now I am 27. I remember playing the video game on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I'd like to show my son this movie. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie just like when I was a child. Although he is much younger than when I first saw him. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! I hope it comes on DVD! Please let it out on DVD !! I'm dying to see it again !!! Well, this is my comment, I hope that one day soon I will see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
