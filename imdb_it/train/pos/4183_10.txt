I saw this movie a long time ago, but I found it unbelievable and up until now it has never stopped surprising me. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film that describes the account of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink Japanese ships in the port of Singapore during the height of World War II. <br /> <br /> These commandos are captured in civilian clothes and are considered spies by the Japanese kidnappers. But something happens that hasn't been explored much in any Hollywood WW2 movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> A friendly and close bond develops between the kidnappers and the prisoners. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend of a Japanese prison guard. This is the most beautiful part of the whole movie and really tears your heart out. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day while the two friends are talking, the Australian captain learns that some other prisoners will be tried and executed for the sinking of the Jap ships in the port of Singapore. He remembers that it was his team and not another that had sunk the ships to his Japanese friend, and after hearing this the Japanese guard says he is silent because it could lead to the execution of the whole group. But the captain remains adamant in confessing it to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respectful way according to their rules. This is the highest honor granted to warriors captured in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most beautiful part of the film in which Australian soldiers await their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is not yet ready to believe it because his Australian friend confessed to be guilty. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal the ending here. But it is more moving than one can imagine and can easily move to tears. <br /> <br /> All in all, an undervalued film that perhaps did not get the recognition it deserved internationally. Receive a copy today and you will be enchanted.
