I had the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the second one when I saw it in a store. This was (I think) just as fun as the first, but a much stranger story. It was funny how they had their own hell and how they had to play to death. The funny thing is that they played it in small stupid games as a clue. The only thing I would change is Station and Death in the band, but apart from that it was great.
