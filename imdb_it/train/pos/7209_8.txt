I bought some movies on disc even though the second level presentation was not an option. A certain company that I don't identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80", and this, to name only three!) Of films that I don't think anyone wants to see in this compromised format. Some records give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are only in their movie version with a ratio of 1.66: 1. <br /> <br /> Which out of my chest, I will say "Deathtrap" was a spooky one strangely enough a funny image. My only complaints are the metallic score (what is this instrument that is usually dragged for films set in 18th century France?) And Dyan Cannon who screams at regular intervals. Couldn't her character be an asthmatic who grabbed an inhaler when she was stressed? Minor complaints, both. The advantages of the discs include the ability to go on fast to go beyond those things you don't like. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a stage version of "Deathtrap", so having these roles in the big impression roles of their careers at that time. Before Broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg, the theater was more convenient for normal people. Now, anyone who pays less than a ransom for a king to get live shows probably won't go to a successful program on the big way. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both great and virile champions in the early 1980s and this is an integral part of how we will react to their profession and to the overall image here. Surely they are not bookish men who cannot fight or draw back from an obstacle. The two are equally large as their criminal stubbornness becomes their last "death trap".
