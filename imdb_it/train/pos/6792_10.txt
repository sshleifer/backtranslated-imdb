I remember this game. He was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new to change, and I got this game. I watched in awe, as it was the first PS1 game I had with 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn't really put the controller down. <br /> <br /> The plot of this game is so good and intricate, it's almost as good as the plot of Final Fantasy VII, and that's hard to accomplish. When you play, you're so involved with the characters that it's unbelievable that it's just a PS1 game, since it looks like a movie. And I think it should be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad this game is a really unheard of game that hardly anyone has ever played or appreciated, as it is one of those games that sits on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% sign on it, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at those who are at the end and try them and many of them turn out to be really good. Heck, that's how I got into Final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprisingly. I wouldn't be surprised if it was made by Square Enix, but it isn't. Almost no game that I play is better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but this is it. But what really bothers me is why it is very little known and not praised, which it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good enough for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It is the PS1 man, made in 1999. The story I have already mentioned is surprising, it almost beats VII. The characters are fantastic, you get so involved with them and their actions. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 10 out of 10. Definitely deserved more praise and a very well done RPG from a company other than Square Enix.
