I am a parent of a child with special needs and I really enjoyed the movie! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. I especially thought that it was as sweet as all the other characters worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother's death. I participated in a screening of the film with other parents and siblings of children with special needs before the film was released. Everyone enjoyed the film and actually inspired wonderful discussions. We talked about how our children make us laugh and we also talked about how we care about them. The writer spoke of how he works with autistic children and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. He based the character on a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has given us very stressful moments. I give the movie two thumbs up !!!
