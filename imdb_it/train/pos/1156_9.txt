Years ago I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie, and I was so rewarded for finding it. It's a wonderful parody of soaps, with jealousies, the usual insecurities of the actors and all sorts of adorable excesses. But more than anything else: an incredible cast and an incredible script. How did someone make all those first-rate actors in such a stupid movie? And how did this little film convince writers to write the perfect lines? I never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit it, but it's wonderful and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I throw it out while I do the cleaning, and I end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonder. Many congratulations to all those who have done it.
