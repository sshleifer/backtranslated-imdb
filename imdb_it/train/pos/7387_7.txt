The events of 11 September 2001 cast their shadow over this award ceremony with a minute-long silence before the in-memory editing and there was little in all the way to sing all the extravagance of the dancing comedy we expected from this awards but this was not a bad thing at all. Entertainment was more or less shortened to a LOTR he sent with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and so it was. The rest of the show was filmed with clips of the nominations and I must admit that this was actually more enjoyable than the exaggerated songs and dance numbers we saw over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was not at all a bad presenter unlike the real The esoteric David Letterman of a few years ago and the one-minute silence for the 9/11 victims was haunting and dignified <br /> <br /> As for the prizes, New Zealand was absolutely robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING has returned home with four minor prizes while A BEAUTIFUL MIND has collected most of the most important prizes except for the best actor who was supposed to attend a tough New Zealand but instead went to an all-American boy. The only Oscars that I accepted, apart from those presented at FELLOWSHIP, were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both correct calls.
