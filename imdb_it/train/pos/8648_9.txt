Kalifornia is a film about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road ever. The road of no return. The plot is about a couple who tried to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that happened in America and his girlfriend - who is a photographer - is about to take photos. So they embarked on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them along the way. To share travel expenses, they decide to find another couple and make an announcement. But the couple that responds is NOT ANY couple. She is one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is a naive and fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. Man is exactly the opposite. A ruthless cruel murderer. We learn it at the beginning of the film and follow it along the journey to Kalifornia (not with C as usual, but with K, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey of betrayal, murder and, finally, defeat. All the protagonists, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes offer really good performances and it must be kept in mind that when this film was shot, not even one of them was a star. The photography is surprising, with the darkness that covers the most important parts of the film and the music adapts to the dark character of the film. Overall this is a really nice movie. Not to be missed. You'll think again before taking a stranger in a car to share the gas with!
