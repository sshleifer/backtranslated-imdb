I LOVE this show, it's sure to be a winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's time we have a girl who is not the cutesy type. The whole cast is wonderful and all the episodes have good plots. Everything is arranged well and rethought. Putting it together must have taken a while, because it wasn't someone in a hurry who just slapped something together. It's a great show altogether.
