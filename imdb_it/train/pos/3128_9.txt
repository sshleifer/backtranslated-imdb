Trivial! I love it! Corny - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt rekindle the same chemistry on the screen that never seems to have come out! They relive old memories, in addition to the actors who play them since the 1960s, they show some things behind the scenes that are quite interesting to know. The TV of the 60s was a shameless one for many of us then, and this DVD is no exception, if you are familiar with the original TV show. The fight scene with the Boofs and Bams written or whatever is fantastic !! The movie scene shows clips of the bad guys who died. In the end, Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. He died not long after making this DVD, I think, so it is to his credit that he returned to play a villain to Adam and Burt, just like he did to Batman & Robin many years ago. He hasn't lost his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar for reliving a bad role, too. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for great memories, and I want to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thank you guys!!!
