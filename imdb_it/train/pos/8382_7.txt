If you like war games mech is pretty good. Some of these are cheap but it's worth seeing the fights with the robots. I liked the mech battlefield for a while and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that comes close to that feeling of what it would be like to fly one of those huge mechs. If you like genres, then the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and Four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to save Steel Battalion. The film deserves to be seen at least once. We really need more movies on the same theme. Fewer renovations and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself
