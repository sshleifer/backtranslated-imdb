I imagine this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can't say I've ever seen a movie that starts with several minutes of graphic horseback riding. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young woman and her ... mine? I traveled to this castle in France, where the woman has to marry the son of the castle owner, who is the man who takes care to make sure the horses take off the stones. It seems that there are legends in that area of ​​a beast that was rather, uh, lively, I guess we can say, with the ladies, or at least, one in particular. There are all sorts of hidden references in this sense, but every time the young bride who is soon to become flushed, her curious hands on a groom's father remove her from her sight. However, the promised young bride goes upstairs to sleep while the family waits for a cardinal to show up for the wedding (a family member, I imagine) and while dreaming dreams of a beast in the woods that has his with her. The effects in this leave something to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not knowing much about it) is rendered ridiculous, especially when certain presented appendices appear as realistic as a bed or a baseball bat. This has a rather strange and sudden ending, but without end, without any clue or much accumulation, but it was a bit appropriate and certainly not what I expected. I don't know, this is a bit difficult to overcome but it has its moments and it's definitely strange. 7 out of 10.
