Salva and his friend Bigardo have been at the edge of the law for most of their lives. We see them plundering in a underground car, where their tone to get donations is so lame, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a small, hardened criminal, does not even have any ransom, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and entertainment turn out to be a winning combination, something on which Save capitalizes. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were in prison after the accidental death of a priest who was critical of the duo. Save shows that it is a natural for the reality show. It turns into a Christ-like figure that is an immediate success in the program. Espe, who is an absurd woman who is the producer of the show, cannot escape the way Salva does her unusual attention. In the end, Salva is a victim of his own success in the end. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first work as a director was a film, had some success in the way the film satirized the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, saw its part of the bizarre, which is what the director heard is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the perspective of the people who are doing a fortune from the naive public. <br /> <br /> The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature film, would have been more effective by focusing on the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the film. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
