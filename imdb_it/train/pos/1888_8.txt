"If I wanted to dribble, I'd call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Haven't you had enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You got me a choo-choo." <br /> <br /> "If I start dying, please remove (the cowboy hat) from my head, it's not the way I want to be remembered." <br /> <br /> Some of the wonderfully humorous and often perceptive quotes from this fascinating and often perceptive film. Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a relationship not father / father and son that defines the man that Arthur must become. Will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? Over twenty-five years, I returned to this film, with joy, fun and joy. It is a film to return to, over and over again, and remember what is important in life, however brief it may be. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
