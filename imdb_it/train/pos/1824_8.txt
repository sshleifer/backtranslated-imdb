All Dogs Go To Heaven is a film that I've always liked. When I was a child, I watched this every other day. It is underestimated if you look at IMDb's ratings and comments from many people in general. This is not a bad movie as many say, it's a great movie. This is good and your kids will probably like it. Although it is rated G, some parents may find this a little violent. It's actually a rather dark story, in which dogs are similar to mobsters involved in gambling, extortion and even in cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie who escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up returning to earth. Many younger children watching this movie may feel like they are watching a children's movie. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that can scare young children, but I'm sure they'll be fine. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was little. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger, this is the film that makes me feel this way. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last film in which a little girl named Judith Barsi was. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn't deserve what happened. Now that I know his story, I can't watch this movie the same way anymore because his voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation of this film is exceptional, the vocal work is exceptional and the story is good, but slightly different from that of many other children's films. This was popular at the time of its release, but was overshadowed by the famous mega Disney The Little Mermaid. This is a film that is not conceived by adults, but if you are a child, or if you grew up with this film as a child, then I am sure you will like to watch it.
