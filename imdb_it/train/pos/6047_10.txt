The brilliant thing of Withnail & I is that it captures that the university has not remained long and that life could go both ways together with all the others refined. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and immediately went to work at the age of 15/16. I know some of the slips set the knife in this movie when it came out at the cinema, but I saw it in a house full of people in Hailsham and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I grew up in Dean's forest and this brought me directly back to my mushroom and mushroom days (he had some great friends - I hate to think about what they all are until now - probably running the local council). I've seen it a couple of times on DVD and I already see the film as an old companion that will always remain part of my collection (how can I appreciate this film and the Dambusters - it doesn't seem right in some way) towards the second half of this film and I think the scenes of social interaction with the locals are done brilliantly. I like the mix of the three main characters and there is a really nice writing in here with some very quotable lines and I would dare to say a good smattering of integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it wasn't released (too bad, because it's a cork). Someone told me that it was originally a theatrical performance, I'm not sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearean touches / references that seem to emerge throughout the film (also noting the Dylan Thomas ref) and like all the little gems, there will always be little things to discover like the final scene that beckons Easyrider as they start their next trip. All in all a really unpretentious piece of film (I love it!)
