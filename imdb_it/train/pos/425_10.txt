I would like to comment on the film April Love. It is one of my favorites of all time because my father Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I distinctly remember when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we lived during that time to do April Love. My father had been in numerous shows and was a talented man. I convinced him to try for one of the pieces offered, and here he is back home with the script. How exciting! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes - especially those shown in the amusement park. He is very nostalgic every April when I see the film being shown again, and Pat Boone's song April Love is still broadcast on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time gone by when you see the films they make today with all their sex, vulgar language and violence. It would be nice to see other movies like April Love back on fire ...
