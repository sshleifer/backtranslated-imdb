THIS IS VERY MY MOST FAVORITE FILM IN THE WORLD !!!!! I loved it when I was 4 and I still have fun at 16! It is an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! It amuses me every second and not only does the film have some great special effects, but it transmits an exceptional message to the young people of the audience, which may seem inconsiderate, but in reality the film is done in THANK YOU! Even though Michael Jackson has been in afew movies now, people still don't see him as an actor. Actually he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! It's incredible !!! MOONWALKER IS TO SEE !!!!!!
