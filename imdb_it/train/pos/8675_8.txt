Without being one of my favorites, this is good for a change of pace ... even if only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (which is renamed "Butch" here). They are all beating each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and suggests they should all be friends. So, everyone signs a peace treaty and becomes a friend ... that won't last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and kind to each other. They even save each other when one of them is in danger of death. The relationship is nothing but excellent, until a very large steak appears and everyone becomes greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual struggles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But anyway ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is a really pleasant and rewarding experience, even if only for a while. <br /> <br /> By the way, as a curiosity, two pieces of "Il mago di Oz" are reproduced here in instrumental versions: "We are out to see the magician" and "Somewhere over the arcobaleno".
