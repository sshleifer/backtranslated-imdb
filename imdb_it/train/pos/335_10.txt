I have been trying to discover this series for centuries! Thanks, IMDb! I saw it as a child and I never managed to get it out of my mind. At 6, of course, I was particularly struck by the cyclops episode, which was absolutely chilling (I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops from a man figurine in a plastic cave, which I still have ) What I also remember, however, was the atmosphere, which was unusual from the beginning - mysterious, austere and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later, I experienced the same feeling. It's a very difficult thing to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every "Odyssey" I've seen since has been a huge disappointment. The characters in this series looked like real, real people - the ancient Greeks - and not some costumed Hollywood stars. This is a true masterpiece! But - Why is it no longer known? And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD? I'd just like to have the chance to see it again!
