I'm not saying that, just like a fan of Chris Rock, I say it as a person who had low expectations in this movie and turned out to be wrong. The first flaw was the end of everything, which everyone has seen coming. Flaw number two I discovered that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed fake. Finally, the acting in this film was sub-par, with Regina King's best actor and the worst was Mark Addy. but I saw beyond that mistake and saw a solid comedy. In a scenario from head to head, look at paradise can wait instead, it's better. So for all Chris Rock fans out there, WATCH THIS FILM, you'll have fun. He has a good stand-up in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
