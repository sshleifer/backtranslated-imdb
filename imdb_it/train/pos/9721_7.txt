How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a somewhat romantic approach. <br /> <br /> It is actually a story by Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) that breaks into journalism and writing a magazine that is interpreted in a fun way. Simon Pegg made a good appearance, a little worse than usual. The film is not hilarious or fun to the end or something like that but it has its moments, and those moments are really hilarious. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and it is worth watching the American with the creamy comedy to all the people who just want to sit down, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you are going to watch this movie with a critical approach, you should move on unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it.
