I have to say that sometimes "looks" are all that matters, just as the BBC's Jeremy Clarkson pointed out (not about our land, but it's right anyway). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to looks, this film is such an incredibly extraordinary beauty that you'll absolutely love what your eyes are about to see. <br /> <br /> And then there is also the personality of the film, interesting, with a captivating narrative voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images. <br /> <br /> The film will probably not affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will surely remind you of how precious our land we really live in is. <br /> <br /> This film deserves its 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic documentaries on earth that I really enjoyed.
