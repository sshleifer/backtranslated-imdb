When I first saw it, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just looked at it again and enjoyed MORE than what I did the last time I looked at it !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and half a handsome boy, which I like. Itchy is his partner. Charlie is killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life, it's the beginning of an extraordinary adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons I'm absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I love characters (except for Carface). My three favorites are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie who arrives shortly after. Two: I love the historical period in which this film is set. It is set during prohibition in the United States. Three: Don Bluth's animation (as usual) is superb. Even the backgrounds are good. Four: There is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: the songs of this are adorable. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, the throbbing, the thrill" ... <br /> <br /> So, watch this adorable movie when you can, you won't be disappointed! :);) :()
