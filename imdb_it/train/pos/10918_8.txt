The Five Deadly Venoms is easily the most memorable K.F. film from the stable of the Shaw brothers (perhaps Master Killer). It has the artists who came to be known as simply "The Venoms", some of the best fighting choreographies ever, and, surprisingly for a Kung Fu movie, a great storyline! One of my all-time favorites !!!
