Who does not know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trio (the three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are published en masse)? Eighteen years after the publication of the first comic, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on the screens. After a first - and failed - attempt with a TV show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and that's what most fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. Some essential parts are missing, the characters and actions of the original. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a 1st class comic book fan, I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are good, so is the scenario, even though it might seem too fast. I therefore recommend this film to all those interested in financial / political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series that I could read on the internet.
