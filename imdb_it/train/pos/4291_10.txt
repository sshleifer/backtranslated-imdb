From the first images of the leading actor, we are given a first idea of ​​how so many women are managed by the women in them, and the humor that comes with everything that happens on the "normal" day of life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, the director takes up the way so many European men feel they have complete control of their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them it doesn't seem that things can work . The use of the facial image throughout the film is superb, and its intelligent positioning of the senior member of the family (mother) is perfect. <br /> <br /> While there are more than enough laughter in the film, it is still dealing with single parents / adoption and family strength in society. Really rewarding to look at, and again one that only the French seam is able to do. <br /> <br /> So far one of the best 50 films I've seen this year, and deserves a start rating of five. I look forward to adding this to the DVD collection when it is released and I highly recommend it to all ages.
