As a comic book reader, who still considers me a total child, I admit that I could have been a little biased towards this film. I mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie in a long time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (see Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men was definitely not a side effect, tension-flash action filled, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. He made everyone laugh in the small theater, and got applause and laughter until the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are both hilarious, as always, and Azaria adds just the right touch of madness. William H. Macy plays a great straight man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, in fart, are added just to keep the kids happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes both Batman and Blade Runner look loathsome), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still simply fun. There are some lines that will catch even the most tired spectators and bring tears to the laughter between us. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Although not an all-time classic, it is twice as fun as the last Austin Powers movie. The writing is good and the cast is GREAT. If you are worried, plan the matinee and pay less, but in both cases you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us doesn't cheer for the losers once in a while?
