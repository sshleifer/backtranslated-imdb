Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a film that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) arrives in America for the American dream. Montana then becomes the "king" in the drug world as he ruthlessly manages his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film contains about 180 F words and lasts almost three hours. This movie is fun and you will never get bored. You root for the Drug Lord, and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as evil as some other Crime Lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you see it. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
