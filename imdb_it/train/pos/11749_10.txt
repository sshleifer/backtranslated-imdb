Finally we have a TV series where we can see the talent of acting! The episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still "I'm not your father - I'm your father and the homonym you betrayed me!" rubbish but the script allowed the actors to perceive and experience those real moments rather than showing us what it would be like, as many TV soap do. <br /> <br /> Even the work with the camera gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there were no "shots in shots or shit for cameras "to add an" artistic edge gave us what we had to see and also some beautiful landscape photos! <br /> <br /> Nothing was too dramatized or melodramatic they were real people in a real place that dealt with real situations, the show had nothing dramatic and was completely relevant. It was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so beautiful that our country can see how talented our actors can be when they get a real script, a real opportunity! Thanks Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all the cast and crew - wonderful work !! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and not go unnoticed!
