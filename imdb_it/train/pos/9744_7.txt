"Yes, Georgio" is a carefree and fun movie / comedy that contains beautiful settings and wonderful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a film I enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviewers have suggested that if you wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, it would probably be better to use a DVD of the work. Although, a full work could be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents, often a work requires costumes and has narrative lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and a character in the ways a work would not do it. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seemed to find the story incredible; I disagree The people of enormous talent can be both egocentric and fascinating - fascinating enough to capture intelligent and beautiful people. Furthermore, people who are very different from each other often acquire knowledge about themselves and grow in a positive way by interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions that they could not choose for themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relation to each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself go in a visually and naturally pleasing film with Pavarotti at the height of his vocal abilities. The final scenes of Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there.
