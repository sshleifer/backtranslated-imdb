I'm a rather pedestrian person, with a bit of a hurried taste. However, I occasionally try to raise the level of my cultural awareness. This film was one of my attempts. I was astonished throughout the film. I liked it so much that I got my tape to see it again. This is a very thoughtful and exciting film. I saw it as a huge question for the viewer: what is the depth of the sacrifice to the duty that can be accepted, can one ask to accept, should one accept? As a military member, this is obviously an important question for me. This question weighs heavily on the observer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
