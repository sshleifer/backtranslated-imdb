First of all, the film is an ingenious piece of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a child pretending to be an adult inherits a million dollars and spends it. I mean how crazy this is. This time Walt Disney has outdone itself. Comedy is most often expected, but at other times unexpected. I mean, this movie was OK or the movie was OK. He also teaches a lot about young essays and I am really smart and a little intelligent. But it sucks. How the hell could a guy like that guy have a nice police girl and his dad let him go free. It is as if a killer were released for ten years. If I had to do this, I would be beaten with a "subble jack" (a huge stick that stings when used to hit your ass hard). That guy is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made this film, but it's still not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry, nor the father, but the brothers were excellent. "The special effects on the other hand were lame. Furthermore, this film is not based on reality. I hated and loved at the same time.
