So many educational films are nothing but very hard work, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" makes fun of them ("Why study the industrial arts?" It comes to mind). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It affects the blood, the heart and the circulatory system. I admit that I don't remember everything from it, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but fun. I imagine you can always count on June Foray (the most famous is the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, a deer plays here). <br /> <br /> Since "Hemo the Magnificent" can be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming.
