I saw this movie several times and saw it today (on TCM) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She's a very underestimated actress and I have to admit I had a crush on her since I first saw her (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago). The real star of this film, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the awards he received. It makes clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Nazism had to be stopped and all that contributed to it was good. He gave his children a joke about being bad, and about not being bad, but as he said before when he talked to adults, he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation. Lukas gave an excellent portrait of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very difficult thing to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I think so - I think it was only after the money. His Nazi partners knew this and that's why they didn't make much sense to him. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the game, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is a German. While the anti-German hysteria of the First World War was not repeated in World War II, there was considerable anti-German sentiment and some Germans were buried in a similar way to what happened in California with people of Japanese origin. For Hellman it was a kind of act of courage to write a play on the good Germans at that time (perhaps he thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi-Soviet pact!). After all, the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and had no qualms about killing innocent civilians. I think, however, that the Dresden bombing and the firestorm occurred later, after "Watch on the Rhine" was released. <br /> <br /> The title is a play on words, given that "the clock" faces west from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song used in World War II, but the Nazis also had their own marching song. But Muller is a German and is engaged in his "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All the other actors have done an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I'm surprised he didn't reveal his father's secret. In real life, he could very well have done it.
