Deathtrap is not a whodunit. It is who will do it first. It's so hard to describe this film without giving anything away, so I won't talk about the plot anymore. As for acting, it's the lead role of Cris Reeves as Clifford, a young screenwriter. You really see the range of his acting skills in this film from "exhaling cheeseburgers" to becoming really terrifying. Clifford is such a difficult role to play and in the theatrical production I've never seen Clifford play well on either side of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen who has the character all the way. As for Michael Caine it is ..... well he is Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film as good as it has ever been.
