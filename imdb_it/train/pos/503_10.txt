After 7 years of watching that terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt rather numb. Next Gen and DS9 were good stuff and Voyager ruined TV Trek. This probably opened with the best pilot for a Trek show. The crew was as good as the choice of actors for the parts. Scott Bakula has played a typical captain first time in deep space and his unprocessed way of doing things has been a refreshing change for the already known captains of before. The rest of the crew was very nice in their roles and I think he left for a good first season. When the show was canceled prematurely, I was really disappointed. In A Mirror Darkly showed us what the cast was capable of. Too bad that a TV movie or film has never been considered. So much backstory and foundation of the federation left to tell, including the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
