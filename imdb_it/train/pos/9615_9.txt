This is a great movie! Many of us have seen Jurassic Park, where the Chaos Theory is summarized by telling the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all this (or at least something, don't worry, it's not a spoiler). I am absolutely not a religious type and I don't believe in predestined things, destiny, etc., but this movie surely makes you wonder if the coincidence really exists ... <br /> <br /> in addition, the acting and the camera are excellent, another proof that it is still possible to make a good film without a billion dollars
