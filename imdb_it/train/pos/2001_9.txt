I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later, during the summer of 1969, I was glad to see this film that was still playing in a famous cinema in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Oscar for best film of the previous year. <br /> <br /> The success of "Oliver!" both on stage and on screen reminded me that not all talent starts on Broadway and ends up in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking peoples, has been admirably brought to the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His fascinating musical has since become a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England in the summer of 1967 and then published in 1968. The musical sets and numbers are incredible. The song "Who Will Buy?" requested hundreds of actors and the British director really deserved his Oscar for putting everything together perfectly. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but above all it is a tribute to the fine art of British film studios, like Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios of Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also given the world many films to cherish over the years.
