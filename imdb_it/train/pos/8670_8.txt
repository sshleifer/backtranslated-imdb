WWE Armageddon, December 17th 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs MVP in a game Inferno: so this is the fourth hellish game of the WWE and it's Kane vs MVP (I wonder why it is was the first game on the card). I only saw the final parts where Kane focuses on MVP's ass while they are in the yard and then MVP is running in the arena while screaming ?? eventually the referees extinguished the fire with a fire extinguisher while the MVP extends along the entrance ramp. Fun and visually pretty fun end. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: originally meant to be William Regal and Dave Taylor against Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular tag team game. However, GM Teddy Long arrives in the ring and announces that it will be a Fat Ladder 4-way team match. MNM and The Hardys are launched and it's all chaos. A word to describe this open your eyes ?? Wow. Dude, I really can't remember how many sick spots there were in this game and words can't really make it justice. There was a particularly noteworthy point in which The Hardys created a ladder in swing position and Jeff jumped from the top while Matt held the MNM for the kill, and then WHAM! Nitro blew away, while Mercury apparently ruined it and bled to death with lacerations on his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the game alone. Another spot was when Jeff overturned London while FLIPPING retired from the ladder. There were other breathtaking places at high altitude, too many to remember. London finally looses the belts to win this rave show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman Vs. The Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for victory and then drool worms on The Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this three minutes in incognito. <br /> <br /> US Championship: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in another typical Guerrero game. Some good points included a superplex on top of Chavo's rope and an unusually long chain of Benoit's German suplexes. Vicki Guerrero arrives in the ring with the belt to nail Benoit but Benoit scares her and it takes a long time to decide whether to put her in a chosen shooter or not. This allows Chavo to get a roll-up but Benoit rolls it again and Chavo is stuck in the Sharpshooter. Game over. Beautiful battle fought even if sometimes slow. 7/10 Championship <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for this, in a fairly moderate game. Did the game have good points at high altitude ?? most notably Helms "moves away from the top of the rope ?? but the crowd doesn't seem to be in it after watching the game of the ladder, and Yang needs to be more on the fly. Helms won the game after blowing Yang with a successone to the knee 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride game: after a series of matches between these two, this time it's a Last Ride game, the second one overall and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse.Good enough for what these two could offer.Kennedy handled a good deal of Taker and even got rid of a chokeslam to throw Taker from Armageddon about 15 feet below, and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal.Kennedy almost got the victory until Taker returned to the hearse (I liked the view of the camera inside the wagon f unebre). Taker then lost a steel tube on Kennedy and broke the hearse window, but then cracked Kennedy with a chair, and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and gravestone on the hearse roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker pushed him out of the arena to win. Actually, I was really interested in the willingness of these guys to make / give really sick shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa enters the ring, I go "what the hell?" like many of the children in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" comes to mind. Pause. <br /> <br /> Batista and John Cena against Finlay and King Booker: we talk about charisma and technicality. This match was actually a pretty good main event with the momentum moving rationally from one team to another and maintaining good suspense. Even Finlay got some good legitimate shots on his opponents this time (I doubted his strength against the champs), and he and Booker couldn't try to cheat ?? except at a point where Booker rammed his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista hits the bomb on Booker for the victory, he has not seen the F-U; Cena however performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle and I think he also did the STFU. This was probably the best technical match of the evening and the participants did really superb for what they could without a 7.5 / 10 scale. <br /> <br /> Being a WWE fan turned on and off, I agree that Armageddon was tied up with numerous eye-catchers in all, and the scale game eventually swallowed half of the show; the Last Ride match saw some pretty amazing points, and the main event went very well for its category too. All the other games were up to their billing except perhaps the meeting between Boogeyman and The Miz and the still useless lingerie contest. Overall, the Armageddon was a very enjoyable pay-per-view and, despite some major setbacks in the PPV history, Armageddon respectfully wishes this year's farewell. PPV rating: 8/10.
