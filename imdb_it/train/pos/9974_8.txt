Of course, this was a remake of a movie from the 70s, but it had the suspense and action of a current movie, for example Breakdown. He's running, desperate to be with his wife in the hospital, the police are the least worrying. The chases were very positive, the part with him that was closed to the limit of a stop was well done, the end of the film was a great cliffhanger. This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a pursuit of muscle machines that was badly filmed? The character of Vigo knew what he had to do to escape from Johnny Law, few films had the effects: night vision, CB radio, okay, I forgot the name of the film, the boy has a little souffa, toys with the boy troubled. The ending is great, you can't tell if it fakes your suicide or not, an excellent fa-he-does-or-not.
