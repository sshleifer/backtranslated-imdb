Anyone who thinks that the anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a good film that tells the story of Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows in the process. The journey on the train represents Tetsuro's journey from childhood to manhood. The film's music and visual styles are a bit dated (we can say it's a film from the 70s) and the animation is only slightly better than your average "Star Blazers" bet. But the story and the characters are so strong, it really doesn't matter. A must for all animation fans!
