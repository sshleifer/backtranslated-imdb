I am a rather old old man, old enough to remember the taste of Oreo and Coca-Cola as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a child was fresh. I wish I had somehow put aside some magic hanging wardrobe, so I could taste those things today. This magic locker could also have adjusted the fabric of the food to explain how I drifted, physically and otherwise, a sort of dynamic of expectations. Over the course of half a century, they would have had to adapt quite a bit, because you see that I would have known that I put them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of oneself and of the past, and history, and the feeling that it would have almost made the intermediate years an anticipated reward. <br /> <br /> I didn't have enough sense to do it with the original Coke. And couldn't I have invented one of those magical psychic lockers? not then. But I did something equally good. In the seventies, I really tuned in to Roman Polanski. Was it a strange and exotic pleasure ?? you know, movies that were secretly introduced into the Soviet bloc. Movies that are so sensitive to the beauty you cry for weeks later. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women, one, and then decide that they would be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and put it aside. I didn't watch it until I thought I'd be old enough to deserve it. Over the years, I would put myself to the test, my ability to surround the beauty and outline it without occupying it. Probably there are few Poles who have worked on this, practicing to deserve Chopin. Working to deserve the womanness when I see it. Trying to get the insides from the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I got something similar to the certainty that it was time to get it out. I already knew that the time had already passed when this would have worked optimally, because I had already seen and understood "9th Gate". <br /> <br /> If you don't know, it's a man who innocently rents a room where the previous tenant (whose story is the name) jumped out the window to die later after the visits of this man (played by Polanski). What happens is that time bends and becomes this woman. We are deceived into believing that he is simply crazy. But the way we follow it is not. It simply has flashes that the world is normal, and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven that distorts its reality. <br /> <br /> History doesn't matter. What matters is how Polanksi forms this thing, both in the way the eye that only creates edges and in living in the body that consists only of confused flesh dwells. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that could torment me for the next 30 years. Is the idea up and in and an out without borders at all ?? not at all except a red wig. <br /> <br /> I don't know anyone else who can do this, this sketch that remains a sketch, this horror that remains natural. <br /> <br /> Understanding the genius of this, you must know one of the greatest films ever made; "Rear window." The genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera models the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this film and turn it upside down. In Rear Window, the idea was that the onscreen display (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything else was a fiction, intertwined as we watched. Here, the inhabitant of the apartment on the screen is the director. We know it. We know that everything we see is true because it is the narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change identities, that times change, that causality is plastic. We know the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in perpetual horror, on that border that imputes but never shows us and makes us imagine. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 4 of 3: Every electrician should experience this.
