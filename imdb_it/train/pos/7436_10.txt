This filmed presentation of "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is the most beautiful and interesting interpretation of Coleridge's poignant poem. The surprising photograph, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the 1798 epic of world-renowned artists, and Michael Redgrave's superb narrative, really deserve a long time to see this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> In the television era, this work is an invaluable tool for inducing young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As far as I know, this type of work is really rare; it is regrettable. As a world literature student and as a former university professor and academic consultant, I feel that larger epics like Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" should be so "translated". Although I am not a film critic but an avid reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this beautiful production without any reservations.
