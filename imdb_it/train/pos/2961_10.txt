This is the only film by David Zucker that does not deny anything of the first of its kind. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury right behind But I didn't think Theres anything about Mary was funny, so it doesn't count except the frank thing and the beans he has. Don't listen to critics in particular Roger Ebert, he doesn't know solid entertainment, just look at his reviews. In any case, you will see that you will never be displaced
