sammo must have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great history, great struggles, great characters and great cameos. <br /> <br /> this movie sees the cock take the billy chow and the chong fat. sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight is full of high-speed action and comedy elements thrown in. <br /> <br /> some great and moving moments in the film, ching ying opens in a cameo and is eliminated - gutted. <br /> <br /> the final sequence will get you to the rewind button, as one of the best final fights I've seen. sammo hires a lot of guys and ends up squaring up to Billy Chow.
