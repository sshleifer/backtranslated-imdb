Hi, this little movie is especially interesting for an artist, filmmaker or music creator or visual artist, for: <br /> <br /> You can feel and examine David's touch / style directly from a short piece of relative simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots, the pots and the sound elements. <br /> <br /> Although simple as a film, this creation is on several levels. For example, there are some sounds that drone all together, while others appear (albeit subtle), in some places to support certain strokes. <br /> <br /> You can also see different types of cookware: some go up and down in a gentle way back. There is a diagonal overview. Even the zooms go back and forth sometimes. <br /> <br /> The flash and the composition / arrangement of the elements in space is, as always and obviously, the work of an artist / painter. This can also be felt in this lousy room. That is to say: you can make exquisite art already with the simple art of positioning the appearance / view and composing the scene. Then come the images of visual images: like digonals, parallels, etc. The slight degradations and the colors, even if without too much research of textures as in the big productions, are also good for them. This is a sketch by an artist ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feeling gives the touch / touch of the David to it, as with any real artist.
