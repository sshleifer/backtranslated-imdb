The Scots excel in storytelling. The traditional type. Many years after the event, I can still see in my mind an old lady, my friend's mother, who tells the Battle of Culloden. Makes the characters animated. His passion is that of an eyewitness. One for the events on the barren heath about a mile from where he lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before she was born, but you won't guess by the way she tells it. The same story is told in bars throughout Scotland. As I discussed with a friend one night at Mallaig, a cutter to give his version. The discussion continued until closing time. <br /> <br /> Stories handed down this way become part of our being. Who doesn't remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become our invisible world. And, as they get older, they can still serve as inspiration or an emotional reserve. Fact and fiction merge with aspiration, role models. Archetypes warning stories. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our protagonist presents himself to us. And it also introduces the story that goes back through the generations. It produces stories within stories. Stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland, its rugged mountains shrouded in fog. The stuff of legend. Yet Seach'd is rooted in reality. This is what gives it its special charm. It has a rough beauty and authenticity, tempered with some of the most beautiful Gaelic songs you have ever heard. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather in the hospital shortly before his death. Burns with frustration. A part of him wants to be in the twenty-first century, to go out in Glasgow. But he grew up on the western shores of a Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> Yet there is a deeper conflict within him. He wants to know the truth. The truth behind his grandfather's ancient stories. Where does the fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind his parents' death. <br /> <br /> He is drawn to make one last fatal journey to the top of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can the truth be told? Or is it all in the stories? <br /> <br /> In this story of stories, we revisit bloody battles, poisoned lovers, ancient folklore and sometimes more treacherous folklore than accepted truth. In this way, we connect with Angus, while living the story of his own life. Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and truly beautiful film in Scotland ever made. Like Angus, I was a little annoyed by the pretext of hanging stories over multiple stories. But, even like Angus, I forgave him once I saw the 'bigger picture'. Forget Braveheart's box office pastiche and the like. You could also give up the justly famous drama of The Wicker Man. To see a film that is true for Scotland, this is probably unique. If you meditate on it deeply enough, you could also re-evaluate the power of storytelling, and the age-old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced.
