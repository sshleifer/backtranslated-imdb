Ok, I know I wouldn't like this movie but I do it. From the lovely interpretation of Pat Morita of a Japanese stereotype to the annoying scream of Jay Leno, I laughed throughout the film. As long as one takes into account that this is not the best film in the world, it is a good film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morita talking to her boss in Tokyo drinking a second neighbor.
