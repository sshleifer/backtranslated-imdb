I liked the movie and would suggest anyone to go out for a while. Do not take the film too seriously because it reminds you that it is Disney and is rated G. It is good clean fun even if some parts can be recognized by adults but children would not notice it, especially the "triangle" between Crudelia, Le Pelt and faithful of Crudelia waiter Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and has really done Crudelia alone and is credibly terrifying even when she is "cured" by her loving ways, she manages to instill fear in the audience with her shrill strumming that literally shakes the theater. (I even found myself jumping on my seat when she surprised you with her "bipolarity" like the dog that loves Ella.) All in all I'm going to see it again in the cinemas, I found myself enjoying it so much.
