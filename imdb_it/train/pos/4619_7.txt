First of all, I'm a big fan of 80s movies and Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday, I wandered into a used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I brought it home and put it in the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age, I am referring more to films like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older boy, etc. We all have those little crap when we're younger And if it doesn't work, we have a broken heart and we think we'll never get over it. Of course we do it. Many times. It's the kind of sweet quality I really got from this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like this happened to me ..." is all through it. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves films from the 80s, films for boys in particular, or anyone who simply wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
