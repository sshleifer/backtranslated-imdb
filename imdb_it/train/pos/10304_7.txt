"Bruce Almighty" looks incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. However, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me more like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and receives divine powers from him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and although he is not his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he is excellent with what he is given to work. Although sometimes raw, the film has some laughter, from Bruce who divides his soup in half like the Red Sea and the reactions of customers to him, as well as the apparently calm and witty image of Freeman's God. Sometimes it's overly exaggerated, and there's a certain humor, but on the whole it can be a little fun. There's a decent supporting cast, like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film turns out to be very romantic and heartbreaking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle". The film is far from perfect, but still pleasant, and much better than I and many people probably expected, especially if we see the deepest message in the film. <br /> <br /> *** of ** **
