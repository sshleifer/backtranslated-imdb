A gem of comedy. A lot of laughter, noisy moments, shop and pub scenes made me laugh out of control. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue well observed - I know people like these! The humor is surprisingly kind and the film (this may sound strange) reminds me of an Ealing play. It's a bizarre little movie with lots of details. Certainly it takes a certain number of views. I looked at it a couple of times (I showed all my friends!) And I noticed something new every time: a bit of dialogue, something visual I hadn't noticed before. I could be really picky and find a couple of flaws in the movie, but I won't, because overall this is a fun and tasteful movie that is really worth watching and that anyone with a sense of humor should enjoy. It is a film that will find his friends and I hope there are many out there. Oh .... and has a great soundtrack.
