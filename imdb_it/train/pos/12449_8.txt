Eventually a good film by Modesty Blaise was published, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the "real" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop on your track and remove all your expectations. So you will notice that it is a story that is very close to the original by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell how Modesty has become the wonderful person she is. It's not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the true story. Some things could have been better, but when you can't forget the terrible movie of '66, then this is a great film. So you're a fan, so sit back and simply enjoy that real story is there with a cover story just to let Modesty know his story.
