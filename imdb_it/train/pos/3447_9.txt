There is no director that I like more than Mamoru Oshii. Unfortunately, though he has directed quite a few films that have gained enormous international attention, there are still some of his films that have escaped the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them, and even though I loved it in pieces, it's not hard to see why Western distributors are rather reluctant to release it. <br /> <br /> Among his big and serious films, Oshii is known for making some smaller and extravagant projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii has really outdone himself with this, creating something that is very difficult to classify, even as a bizarre Japanese film. Go to the figure. <br /> <br /> In its central core there is a documentary not really different from Otaku no Video. But rather than making fun of an existing subculture, Oshii invents his own and digs into the life of culinary heroes, stealing food for free and supporting the Japanese culinary level. Oshii's approach to the subject has close ties to Dai-Nipponjin, as the subject is treated with a sense of deadly gravity while the images on the screen seem ridiculous. Impassive humor taken to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, rather than just shooting his mockumentary Oshii decided to do it using a new visual technique called superlivemation. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and puppets on a stick. Performed and recited (or proposed, if desired) by the greats of the Japanese animation industry no less, as the project should have been as low-budget as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think it almost covers it, I know the film is extremely rich in dialogue, which makes it a good companion for Innocence. The influence of beggars is analyzed by all kinds of cultural, political and even philosophical corners, shot to the public through a continuous flow of monologues and dialogues. And to make it even worse, the whole film is completely rooted in the history and customs of Japan, making it even more difficult for a foreigner to have a good grip on the material. Needless to say, more visions are recommended to get the best out of all the hidden details in the film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, at a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already quite amusing. Various beggars are introduced, just as they were the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The film sounds like you should expect a serious documentary from any other important figure to be revealed, but somehow the large photographic photographs cut out and animated of which the figures are brought together do not make everything so serious. The range of characters introduced is sublime, Shinji Higuchi takes the cake as a cow creature wearing a nose ring while hiring fast food chains with his bull / people band. <br /> <br /> Regular Oshii Kenji Kawai provides, in addition to a rather comical performance, a soundtrack that varies from atmospheric and dark to extravagant, strange and comic. A lot of fun comes from the noise and exaggerated effects, completing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Visually the film is very suggestive, even if it must be said that the animation is rather scarce and while effective, it remains attenuated, only to burst with hyperactive strangeness from time to time. Which is not exactly a bad thing, to see how Tachiguishi is so heavy for dialogue. Despite this, the film is still a visual masterpiece because each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to improve the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful though, because Tachiguishi requires a lot from the viewer. If you don't speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading to do and there are many cultural references that require attention. In addition, monologues in the film area are quite extensive and can be difficult to follow. The film still lacks English subtitles and even though my French was largely enough to understand what it was, I'm sure I missed many of the film's best points. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy movie to enter, but halfway through it comes and doesn't let you go from there. I still hope to see it again with English or Dutch subtitles. A dub would actually be the best for a film like this (very similar to Container), although I imagine a quality dub anime is a bit too much to ask. <br /> <br /> With all this said, I can only congratulate Oshii on another wonderful film. It is rare to find a film that mixes and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and that still works. The film is smart, looks and sounds great and is full of creativity. It's immensely fun, even if you can't see all the details of the first vision. But make sure you have it at least with decent subtitles, since the machine translation in English that is floating out there is completely useless and does not do the film justice. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi addresses a very specific audience and I'm not surprised the French got their release while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the western world) is still waiting for a sign of this movie . But for those who love Oshii, they appreciate dry and impassive humor and crave creative spirits, it is a film that cannot be missed, even if it could also be wrong. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
