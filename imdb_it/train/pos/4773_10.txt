Nice piece of good cinema. This is one of those movies that you see smiling and don't know why. Well, one of the reasons could be that we are facing one of the most amazing directors of today, and is able to film emotions. <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie you can hear what Mr. Straight felt when he made the decision to visit his brother with his "wonderful" John Deere. What has changed in your mind? What has changed in YOUR mind when you watched this movie? <br /> <br /> A beautiful story of fraternal love.
