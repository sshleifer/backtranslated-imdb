Full marks for rendering Pacino's speech on the dead man's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be shameful !! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader or was it Ken Lipper who had to be complimented on the extraordinary dialogues? They are rich and intelligent and deserve your time if you like movies with good scripts. I found the narrative story to develop quite well until the post scriptum. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to talk about in this film; John Cusack also played better roles than this. It is interesting to note that the film is very masculine - women are mere appendages.
