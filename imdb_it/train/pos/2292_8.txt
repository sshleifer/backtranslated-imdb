I just saw this Bugs Bunny (the first time he was named here) and the Elmer Fudd comic on the ThadBlog connected by YouTube. This was Chuck Jones's first time directing the "wascally wabbit" and, consequently, Bugs has a different voice provided by Mel Blanc than the Brooklyn / Bronx we are most familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he is channeling Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality at the time). However, after Elmer bought his pet, Bugs makes it hateful by turning the radio out loud, pretending to die after his master repeatedly pulled him out of his shower, saying "Turn off those lights!" every time Elmer takes him in his bed. Even with the different voice, Bugs is definitely his mischievous self and I made myself laugh all the time blue! According to Thad, there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer that was giving the house to Bugs after the hell he had passed but that was probably considered too sad since at that point he suffers from a mental breakdown so it is equally right that he cuts the scene is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
