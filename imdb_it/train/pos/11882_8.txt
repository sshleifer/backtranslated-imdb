This film was in my collection for a while, but wasn't it before a friend of mine reminded me of it ?? until I decided I had to watch it. I didn't know much about Close to Leo ?? only that it had to be excellent for older films and is dealing with a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Even if the person who has help ?? is it Leo ?? the scenery envelops the way Marcel (Leo's younger brother) mates with his relative's illness. At the beginning everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel ?? Do you think he is too young to understand his brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to parents' reluctance to discuss it with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and act more adequately than themselves. With the exception that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, did they leave me with an impression? the way they supported their child ?? even after discovering the truth about her sexuality and her illness. Was it a gesture on their part that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend? most of the families I know will be reluctant to do so. Is there much heat in the scenes where the brothers spend time together ?? you can see them being real friends, worrying about each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, which I highly recommend
