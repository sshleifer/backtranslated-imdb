It was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was disturbing, atmospheric and terrifying. When the mother's ghost lent the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be watered down, and that Buffy would take away the dark and terrifying nuances of the original version. I shouldn't have been interested. The producers of this film wisely kept the same Japanese who were involved with the original film and gave the film the same man. They also set it in Japan in the same position, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took the trouble to redo the same movie he had in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. This actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of "Strangers in a Strange Land" to the general horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless phantom, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. He just added to the film's general anxiety and thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy really does a great job. He seems vulnerable and is able to transmit his fear well. There are none of the intelligent observations that are so common to American horror films, or a lining that diminishes the darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring, which I really enjoyed. I hope that the future of American horror will follow more closely the Japanese New Wave of horror that began with the incredible success of Ringu. Finally we are getting movies that actually can be classified as "Horror" !! 8/10
