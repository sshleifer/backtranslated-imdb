Fragility - 8/10 - Apart from sensory and "Bill Paxton Directs" aside, this is a good old biblical horror thriller. In the end, it may end up being just the cousin of Kubrick's southern Gothic "The Shining" --- but hey, this is a pretty damn funny notion. It also has a nuance of plot ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of film that people will be sticking to late at night on the basic cable for years and will scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it. Too bad the director Bill Paxton had to go and hire himself to act ... oh well .... still a heck of a good rent.
