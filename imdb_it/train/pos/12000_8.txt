I think the film is educational. However, it fails to address the problem that has caused so much controversy: plural marriage. Moreover, the film fails to reveal what the LDS church marries. The great opportunity to tell the world what they actually believe was missing. I could not have a clear idea of ​​what the views of the Church are on central topics of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many SUG friends and they are nice people. It would have been nice to have a clearer picture of how they see the most controversial statements of their prophet. Perhaps these statements are too controversial to be dealt with in a film format, but it would have been wonderful to hear Joseph Smith's entire interesting life story. After all, it gives an idea of ​​American thought on religion in the 18th century. I hope they make some documentaries on this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We could have a Mormon president one day. After all, Smith is a presidential candidate.
