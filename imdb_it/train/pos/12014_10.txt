This is by far the most incredible film I've seen in a long time. The actors played the characters in the film wonderfully. The story has been carefully depicted. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat in Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and did not do so. He thinks it's ridiculous for making the trip and it's daunting. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film accurately portrays his life and part of the history of the LDS Church at the same time. Sometimes it was graphic, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very credible, which caused my emotions to leak out. The shooting was fantastic. The way the story was presented was moving. After the film ended, we sat without being able to move. I was stunned. For the people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I would encourage you to see it. If only to get an understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I would encourage you to see it. Your testimony of this incredible man will increase. This is a must see.
