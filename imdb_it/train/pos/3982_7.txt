This particular short subject by Joe McDoakes was obviously inspired by the spectacular Warner Brothers Starner, Thank Your Lucky Stars, one of those wartime all-stars for the morale of the period. In that Eddie Cantor played both himself and a comedian who would like to get into the movies, except for his resemblance to Cantor. George O'Hanlon who starred in McDoakes's short films is both he and McDoakes who are just trying to take a break in the film. As thanks to your Lucky Stars, some Warner Brothers counteracted the players with a free moment and went through this movie. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon was sent by a central casting for a small role as a line in a WWI movie, but McDoakes gets the message. The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment, he starts thinking about ways to express his one line. Perhaps playing like a real movie star would help. <br /> <br /> 86 later leads to the exasperation of director Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook who plays a British armored soldier who find a niche in the world of cinema for the poor McDoakes. It is worth seeing this very funny short film that was nominated for an Oscar to find out what happens to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
