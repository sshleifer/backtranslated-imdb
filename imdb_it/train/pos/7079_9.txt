I really enjoyed it - I'm a big fan of movies that confuse your mind and leave you many questions and ideas to discuss, and that was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always. Let's just forget Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, should we?). <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the way in which he handled the theme of time travel and the avoidance of paradoxes - the way in which past and future events have become intertwined and fed with one other. <br /> <br /> It was also very well done aesthetically - the art direction was really great, and I'd like to be able to see it on the big screen. The scenes of the future had a similar feeling to Brazil in many ways, and even the scenes present were often visually convincing. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most surprising thing was the presence of two actors who normally don't like very much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both offered incredible performances here. Pitt in particular - I had seen one or two films before I realized that in reality he could actually act (contrary to what I had originally thought), but this really exceeded them. In fact, I found myself asking my friends at one point "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although, let's face it, it may not be too mean).
