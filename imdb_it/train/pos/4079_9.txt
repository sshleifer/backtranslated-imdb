I saw this film for the first time when I was about 8 on TV in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely loved it, and my heart was broken when it was repeated a little later and I lost it. I was enchanted by the story and the characters, but above all by the disturbing and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbing version that I saw - sometimes mistakenly called "Streamline Dub" (dubbing was actually by Ghibli himself and distributed only by Streamline) which unfortunately is not available except as part of a ridiculously expensive box laser disk -set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I hear that the release was partially ruined by Disney. Dubbing is OK, but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the dub "streamline" or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to be the protagonist. They have made some useless alterations, like changing the name of the main character from "Pazu" to "Patzu" and adding some dialogues. But worst of all is that they ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the airships' opening scene, for example, was originally silent but was ruined by Disney's compulsion to play music every time someone didn't speak, what which I find annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This film continues to wipe out the latest animation films, and I can't recommend it well enough. The plot is simple but captivating and the film shows a talent that unfortunately lacks in most modern homogenized mass animation systems.
