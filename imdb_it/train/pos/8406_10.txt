In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy, my parents had just got the home box office which was quite new in our neighborhood. As a 12 year old boy, this was the first time I saw the tits on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. Racing vans, the total clean-up of the ass with the meanest van, the waterbed, the smoke of herbs, the chicks of the 70s, the love for my Chevy song, was all so new to me. A complete film with all the memories you could hope for. I own it and enjoy it once a year. When I watch this film, I want to take my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a straight line, go to the park and hunt down some girls with feathered hair. really great memories of young adolescence!
