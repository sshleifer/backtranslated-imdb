Yes, of course, it's poor, it's not a Zombie, but it's not so bad. It has Beatrice Ring which is a huge bonus, and it's fun. I was lucky enough to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience, since he was never completely satisfied. It is worth a search, especially for genre and Fulci fans. It is a film that too often is rejected in a misleading way.
