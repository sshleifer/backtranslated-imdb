I vividly remember the original series mainly because of its unique blend of ironic humor and macabre arguments. Kolchak was a hard-mouthed journalist from the chronicle of Ben Hecht in the big city, and his gritty determination and assayer's attitude made even the most banal episode eminently watchable. My personal favorite was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of its totally original plot. A poor and restless Cajun youth from Louisiana bayou participates in a sleep research experiment for dream analysis. Something goes wrong inexplicably, and literally dreams of living a swamp creature that inhabits the dark stories of his youth. This malevolent manifestation seeks out all the people who have twisted the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death. Kolchak investigates and discovers this horrible truth, much to the displeasure of police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully tested by a surly Keenan Wynn) and the sleeping researcher of the chief of the Second City improviser, Severn Darden, in droll underestimated perfection. The terribly funny and heartbreaking ending takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is a highlight of the series. Kolchak has never been better. Timeless.
