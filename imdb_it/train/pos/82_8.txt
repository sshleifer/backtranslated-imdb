Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans (most likely all the baby boomers who grew up in the late 50s and 60s), three adult actors / actresses appeared when they did the reunion show in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna have both died shortly after. As fun as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino again, was it as mysterious to talk about the total absence of mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? I realized that Little Luke had disappeared in 1999, but I don't know how. There is no information on Hassie on the internet that I can find. Very curious that they weren't even mentioned? It was so obvious, their absence from the show Reunion, that I suspect that it is the family of Michael and Lydia herself (if still alive), 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and therefore their wish was granted, or 2) TNN couldn't find any trace of Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have vanished. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the Walter Brennen retrospective was wonderfully done. They didn't do anything ... it was the grandfather who made this show such a success. I remember imitating grandfather's walk as a child and my parents laughed (as I'm sure a million other kids had done then). A nuisance that bothered me a little, was the tendency for Richard Crenna to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed completely able to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to talk and say too much during the Reunion show. Unlucky, since I wanted to hear from all three, in the same way. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real pleasure for me. I've watched it on DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
