Recently, when I was shopping, I saw the box of American gothic and thought "I remember!" I used to set the alarm to go back and watch this when I was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30 (I was 14). I remember it above all because it was really scary and strange, no person could ever be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!). No one has ever been. <br /> <br /> What bothered me is that they did the same thing with the box as on TV. Strange episodes, I kept thinking when Dr. Matt ??? - they made him so confused. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the fault of the writers, producers or directors (the TV people in the background money makers continue to do the same - just watch shows like Carnivale and Farscape they don't like the originality in the studios !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Finally - If you haven't seen it and you define yourself as Science Fiction Sci-Fi, Horror, supernatural drama ... Fan = DEVI. They even said the same thing in SFX when they reviewed the box.
