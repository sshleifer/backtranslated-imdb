A community in Connecticut is the setting for this "under the radar" film that is fascinating, fun, fun and engaging. Although he has won awards at major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not distributed to theater hordes across America, but was distributed in DVD format and shown selectively in theaters. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that "The Big Bad Swim" has never had the exaltation of the marketing of a Hollywood version, considering how many sinkers have published Hollywood HAS this year, like "I Know Who Killed Myself". "The Big Bad Swim", a really good independent film, had to swim upstream. <br /> <br /> However, in "The Big Bad Swim", the actress Paget Brewster is as captivating and credible as Amy, the math teacher from the point of view of the wired connection that is not only downloaded by her husband but is about to lose his job and end up betting on a new life. TV actor Jeff Branson, who is HOT, plays Noah, the serious and vulnerable swim teacher who does the extra pool to help his students overcome their fears and discovers he can learn from his students. The beautiful and sexy Jess Weixler (I just saw her in a bank advertisement?) She skillfully plays Jordan, the future swimmer who works twice, one as a pole dancer, the other as a blackjack dealer. His character provides the catalyst for change between the ensemble, but it is the least comprehensible of the characters, due to the lack of a "backstage" or the motivation for why he does what he does. Jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous younger brother who looks at the camera and the spy. However, his parents are not shown to be involved in his life in any way, which seems strange. There is neither a drunken mother nor an abusive father here to explain why a normal and attractive girl from a suburb of Connecticut chooses to be a polysemic dancer who shows up for the stag parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this quirk, "The Big Bad Swim" succeeds, in large part, because it is a happy, beautiful film. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, we learn to swim is the metaphor of life. After all, it's better to jump with both feet and swim, rather than sit on the deck, because life happens to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Big Bad Swim is a great movie for dates, a great dorm movie, a great movie "what I didn't see", and men like it like women.
