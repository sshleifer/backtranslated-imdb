I wholeheartedly agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most surprising and instructive I have ever seen. As I said before, I remember that I started looking, thinking it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was really wrong. Not only was the history of the colony incredible, but I remember that music is a part of its charm. If I remember correctly, they were Native Americn tubes (similar to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I also searched for a copy. This should be required for anyone's surveillance, but especially for schools. It should be republished.
