There are not many movies around that gave me the feeling that Stardust did everything during the film. Like magically fairy-tale like The Princess Bride, Stardust is certainly the most wonderful fantasy show of the 2000s and 90s. Exciting, exhilarating and endowed with wonderful images and unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro in particular, I challenge anyone to watch this film without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that fascinates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars and not one decimal Less.
