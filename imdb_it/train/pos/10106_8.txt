After "Aakrosh", this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a director. Until this film was made, there were no viewers for documentaries in India. This film has shown that a documentary can satisfy the requirements of a commercial film without diluting it. It was one of the hit movies of the year in which it was released. This film challenged the big bollywood flags such as "COOLIE", "BETAAB", "HERO" in 1983. <br /> <br /> SmithaPatel, in this film he acted more like a consciousness of the hero every time he he moved away or lost his composure, he was there to remind her. It wasn't like a usual heroine to do the usual stuff around trees and bushes. Once, he even abandoned his love when the hero's cruelty touched the roof. <br /> <br /> There was another character in this film, which was played by contemporary Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah.He interpreted as an inspector turned alcoholic. The role conveyed the message of the final result of an honest policeman who rubbed the wrong side of the system that gave viewers the chance to predict the hero's ending. <br /> <br /> In his debut film, Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated audiences with his cameo role which ultimately earned him the best supporting actor from the film. The policeman in the film was not a complete and direct personality, he was able to adapt to the system to a certain extent. The anger he left in half continued in Govind Nihalani's other film "Drohkaal". Even after two decades, this film is remembered only for the director and the entire crew. Everyone has done their part par excellence.
