Jim Carrey is good as usual, and although there are some "moments of Jim Carrey", it is definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie". <br /> <br /> It is aimed primarily at children, and I was able to enjoy myself like that movie. He was promoted to Israel as another Jim Carrey film, so those who expected a strange comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has some good moments and works well like a children's movie. I can't say that I really enjoyed this movie, but again I'm not its target audience!
