This is a rather boring film. Well shot with realistic performances, in particular a very good one by Depardieu as a cad and a bad boy with realistic positions and artistic connotations everywhere, he fails because the director does not take a position, position or critical comment on the subject he stipulated. One of the most respected and usual French working partners in the films with Depardieu - I believe they have made 7 of them together - Pialat is not committed. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a caring boyfriend ready and the kindhearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the Don Juanista with indifferent distinction, offers answers to the obrobrio like "I don't know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way he makes love" for the investigating husband who tries to drive her out of the house, but he turns pale and gives it back because ... I assume you love her. So accept and hope for what? That one day he will wake up and come to his senses. Things like this don't have an answer in Pialat's patronizing docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers don't add up, but please take a position. Jules et Jim, this is not. The last shot, as cold as the movie we've just seen, is a heartache and a headache only for the most forgiving.
