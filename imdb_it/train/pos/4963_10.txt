Leave it to Braik to make a good show. Finally he and Zorak live their lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I must say that I love both of these shows. They are completely what Adult Swim started. Brak has grown up with an album released in 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was very popular with people who love Adult Swims shows. I must say that of all the Swim shows for adults without plot, this must be the one with the most unattractive storyline ever made. This is why I like it so much, it's a classic in Adult Swim's story. I think this is simply a great show, if you don't like it. Hey, there were tons that hated and tons that loved it.
