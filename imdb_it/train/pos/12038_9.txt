Yes, a true classic! This is the real British drama, the realism and minimal use of special effects (and excessive budgets). Last time I saw this drama when it was shown for the last time on British terrestrial TV in 1994. It should be seen by everyone who likes a scary plot, without big names but with a great acting. Only copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this unlikely drama is unlikely to be broadcast anytime soon. I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, so now I can once again enjoy this great British drama. You should try to have fun too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
