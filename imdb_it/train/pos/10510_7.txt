This is an OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. Actors are generally fine, but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet like Mr. Knightley, particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good but, again, I preferred Emma by Kate Beckinsale. There are excellent supporting performances by Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often interpreted too much for laughter, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set gags here, and even Frank Churchill's subplot is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenario. It's too lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do this. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms I liked this film, but I would recommend television adaptation more.
