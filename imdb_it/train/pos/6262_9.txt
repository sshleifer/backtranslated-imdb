It was unbelievable, which meant that it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this astonishing migration twice a year, and that the directors, Cooper and Schoedsack, had not staged some scenes and shots. But what shots are they! Cinematography, in the most extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the Iranian soundtrack added to the video version gives this memorable documentary further richness. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this and "Kon Tiki" in the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly showed me how hard, tough and brave they can be, and for primitive survival that for the need of adventure or in the name of science.
