This may have been the definitive noir film of all time, if Columbia Studios hadn't cut so much of Orson Welles's original. What we have left is an imperfect but brilliant film that depicts the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> 'The Lady From Shanghai' is film noir is more sparkling and confusing. Welles, with an irregular accent, portrays Michael O'Hara, an Irish Irishman, who, after a fateful encounter with the seductive and dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a BIG performance) finds himself practically forced to accept a job as a member of the her yacht crew and her paralyzed husband (Everett Sloane). Elsa, or "Rosalie" like Michael likes to call her, plays the innocent and defenseless doll very well, trapping O'Hara in her canvas. While the lovers conduct a not-so-secret affair at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner in his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), will board. He is a strange and unreliable figure who offers Michael a unique proposal: he will get $ 5000 to help Grisby simulate Grisby's death, so it looks like a murder. The plan is for Michael to go down from a technical point of view, and escape to the sun with Elsa. But things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> Hayworth offers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrait. Sometimes he seems really vulnerable and childish, sometimes brutal, tired of the world and tough. It is always brilliant, whether the situation makes her drip into a bathing suit or dressed in black, brandishing a gun. Hayworth is magnificently photographed here, and is a great beauty of her famous "Guild" role. Her then husband Orson Welles cut his typical auburn hair for a dyed blond crop (with the irritating Columbia boss, Harry Cohn). It was a terrific marketing ploy, and he changes his attitude wonderfully changed. She is not the nice femme fatale of Gilda, but she is a predatory lady with a black heart who considers murder a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The coupling between Welles and Hayworth came a time when the couple had extreme difficulties in their marriage. They would have divorced after the film was made, so this is also a curiosity to provide a vision of the complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic lovers, so it's difficult to assess whether or not they have real chemistry on the screen. Certainly every encounter is powerful and full of raw sexuality, with Welles as the "boy of the falls" (he himself admits it in the movie!) And Rita as the double crossroads. <br /> <br /> The character of Welles is the typical "tramp" noir with little sense. As Welles' voice-over shows he uses, O'Hara doesn't actually use his brain much "he expects to think of her (Elsa)". Welles usually played with intelligent and charismatic people, so his turn here as Michael is unusual and very interesting. In fact, Welles was a talented actor and got along well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is adequately slim as Hayworth's crippled husband. One wonders why he takes Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him in a romantic way, so why does he invite a "threat" on board? An interpretation could be that Michael provides the "service" to his wife that Bannister cannot in his paralyzed state. There is certainly something in this theory, with many implications for Elsa's behavior before she met her husband (was she a sort of prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets is hinted at in various scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a confusing and twisted film with a plot that is eventually defective. We are more interested in the love triangle than in the plot of the murder, as with most noirs. Welles gives us many of his usual and fantastic cinematic touches, including the justly famous "hall of mirrors" climax. It's a terrifying scene, an ending that can almost erase previous flaws in the film and bring it to greatness. This fun scene from the house is visually stunning, with a touch similar to Dali's to the painted sets (it seems that Orson painted them himself). The subtle visual images used in the film by Welles improve the plot and make this experience stimulating. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is red-hot and confused, superbly transmitted by the alternative low voice of Rita and impotent, high-pitched girlish voice. Hayworth demonstrates his acting ability in this, and shows that SHE is the last femme fatale of the 'noir'. It's a shame (just a little, since Rita was a brilliant dancer) who made so many delicious but bubbly and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 1940s, instead of a dark-toned noir like this. She was a brilliant actress when she had the chance to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
