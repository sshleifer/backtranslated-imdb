With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this very interesting program, which although it had only a short period of time, was a great idea with good narrative lines. Generally not seen for over 40 years it would have been worthwhile to see him again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was a fragment of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, riding his famous rocket racket, where he was often referred to as "The Fastest Man Alive".
