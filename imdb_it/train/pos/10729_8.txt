Some summer space campers were accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was running out. They had to send someone to a space station to get gas tanks, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling of everything is possible, if you put it inside. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see those young actors who still look the same after so many years. (I saw this film for the first time in the year 2000, it was shot in 1986) There are many people in that movie who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The vision has been fantastic space. Does not seem unreal. It's about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you don't even notice it. You know it's not real, but you get it sucked to the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good family film. <br /> <br />
