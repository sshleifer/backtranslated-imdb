Nick and Kelly are ready to get married but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change Kelly's honeymoon. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a nice couple. Nick loves drinking, smoking and playing billiards with the boys for fun, but Nick suddenly abstains from this kind of fun. Sex is the only thing he loves because he wants a child. We discover that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with the women of the Earth to save their population. It becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens, also involving the dog population. A nice movie.
