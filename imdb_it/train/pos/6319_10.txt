Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I couldn't wait to see the final copy. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I haven't laughed aloud in a play for a long time! It's a great slapstick. The Russo Brothers have done a great job of directing. The entire cast plays their best comedy ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's fantastic as the crippled puzzle in this movie. I was the best from William H. Macy as a scammer "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" who keep you in "points". I think they have the most fun roles in the whole movie.
