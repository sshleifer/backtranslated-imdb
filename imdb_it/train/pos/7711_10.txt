Okay, so Robbie is a bit fancy by today's standards, and some of the plays are pretty rigged, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old with a decent editing program. And don't let me start with the poster. <br /> <br /> This is STILL a great movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up watching "science fiction" in the "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" cinema at the local TV station on Sunday afternoon, so I saw a lot of SF movies from the 1950s. At a time when most films contented themselves with slapping a rubber costume over someone and demolishing a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet lifted the bar forever and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction film that had a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many science fiction films made in the 1990s will still be considered worth seeing in 2030.
