I found memorable quotes for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old Person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: Do you remember the pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old Person 1: And I can remember you fell for that, hook and sinker. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: Oh, I didn't. <br /> <br /> Old lady: you did it. You put a big bucket on your head and you left with them to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: Aren't you dead yet?
