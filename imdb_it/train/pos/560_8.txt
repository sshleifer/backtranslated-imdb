Another excellent Mann film thanks to the combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart's father / son. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic consciousness of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). It is there to see that the younger man takes the fork or bends. "You're wrong, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he only cares for himself, but it is clear that he cannot leave Brennan. John McIntire is as excellent as Skagway's law with due respect for the justice traps on its reality. Another key issue is to help people and, in turn, be helped by people. The solitary can do neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> The caption above reproduces Tatum's claim that he cannot live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction is fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now I own the DVD.
