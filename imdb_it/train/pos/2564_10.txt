Personally, I think Sayonara was the greatest film I've ever made. He touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete the tragedy. And Brando should have won for the best actor. Anyway, the film is fantastic, the man is attractive to ENTER MEN AND WOMEN and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it and fall in love.
