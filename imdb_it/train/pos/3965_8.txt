The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with the co-stars played by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly checked and approval of the script, as well as every aspect of the film, up to clothing, was closely monitored and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover didn't have something to be proud of. His management of the office from 1924 to his death was entrusted to the best investigative services in the world. But in 1959 Hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started collecting dossiers on powerful people to secure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no movie showed even a single wart on the office. The films show only continuous successes and glosses on the failures that occurred, and the role of the bureau in the witch hunts of the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with a firm tongue.
