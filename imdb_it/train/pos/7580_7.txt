As much as I enjoyed the Hanzo the Razor films, three are definitely enough: "Who's Got The Gold?", The latest adventure for the Japanese businessman with the impressive package, is quite a fun piece of Pinku cinema , but offers little new in terms of ideas while taking a big step back in regards to outrage. <br /> <br /> The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost, and it seems as if she is about to explore the supernatural territory, something that could have taken the series in a new interesting direction; unfortunately, after the spook turns out to be nothing but a Scooby Doo ploy (cooked by a corrupt treasury official who keeps people away from the lake where he hides stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is content to recycle familiar items from the early two films, the result is a rather old affair. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo conducts an investigation that requires him to question women through the use of his mighty penis, to slice his enemies and abuse his superiors. Along the way, we get wild orgies, good-natured rapes (Hanzo forces himself on women who end up appreciating his obstinacy) and bloody battles with the sword. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen and enjoyed the first two films, you could also watch this episode to complete the set, but beware, this is probably the least satisfying of all. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
