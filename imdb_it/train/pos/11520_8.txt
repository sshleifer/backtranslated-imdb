The road movie par excellence ... if your idea of ​​a road movie involves three aspiring magicians with accents from Eastern Europe and Claire Forlani. (Well, one in four is not bad ...) A talentless wizard with an eye for the show (Max) observes a very skilled pickpocket (Hugo) who carries out his activity in New York. Having convinced Hugo that (Max) is a) mind and b) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage wizard come alive, the not-so-dynamic duo relies on the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions (Milo) and, ah, more gentle attributes of a beautiful waitress (Lydia). The improbable four batteries in a van (obtained from Hugo ... one guesses where it comes from) and head towards Las Vegas. The blow follows. However, it's fun, it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart, and so much the better was completely unexpected.
