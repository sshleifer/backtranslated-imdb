Long last! An Iranian film that is not produced by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, a funny black comedy with subversive girls who subtly kick the "system" in his ass. It's about football and it's fun, it's really fun. The director says "The places are real, the event is real, as are the characters and extras. That's why I deliberately chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would introduce a notion of falsehood". Non-actors will cheer on them right away if not a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. He won the Grand Prix of the jury, in Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it's almost perfect. WHERE, where can I get it?
