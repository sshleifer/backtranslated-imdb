ANTWONE FISHER is the story of an emotionally troubled young sailor from the United States Navy. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him understand that his problems stem from his child education. <br /> <br /> Prepare to shed a tear or two. The film could melt the coldest heart. I loved the story, which turns from something so terrible to happen to anyone in a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film, especially on forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think are the abuse, adoption and custody of children. <br /> <br /> Winner of the Academy Award, Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. They understood the beginning (dreams of a little boy, check out the giant pancakes!) And the ending (dreams turned into reality), which tied history together beautifully. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally faced his mother and his reaction to her. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to managerial responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar and was successful in all his roles. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor, Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for Antwone Fisher's part. He interpreted the work as very real and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played the part of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, looked like a ray of sunlight on the screen. Chemistry flowed well among romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the part of Mrs. Tate, a despicable character, deserves a special mention. <br /> <br /> Even if we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave an exceptional performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
