The eyeliner was worn almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. In reality it is not much to be around in the 12th century. Also, I didn't realize that the series had failed. Is there a second season on the air now it's not there? It's incredible to me when comments are made by those who are ill-informed or don't watch a show at all. It is a waste of space on the tables and other times. The first show of the series was perhaps a bit painful when the cast started to fall into place, but it's to be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I look forward to the second season in the United States.
