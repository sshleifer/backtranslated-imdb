This film is excellent and I would recommend that you rent it for anyone who owns the local video store. Or better yet, you could buy it because you're likely to watch it again and again. I remember seeing this movie as a child and it was great back then. But after looking at it again yesterday I found it surprising. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (though not exceptional as "Mr Magoo", another of my favorites) and action. This deserves 10/10 and I hope they will soon make a sequel (fingers crossed). If you babysit or you have to look after small children for anything, I suggest you rent this movie because it will keep them entertained for hours :).
