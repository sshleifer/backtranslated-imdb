<br /> <br /> So, not being a poet myself, I don't have a real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement, while shaping the beauty of nature in his work, is captivating. Watch him stick his rods together in a spider web hanging on a tree for a few minutes while he talks about his work, and then he receives the payment when the camera cuts the shot. Be amazed by the ease with which it operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze hits the entire network. <br /> <br /> The genius of Goldsworthy apparently knows no bounds since his inspiration is nature itself. It is in the essential change of nature in which his work, although complete in its sphere, is made complete.
