Every child has that movie that he puts on VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there's a babysitter around. This was that movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you exactly the whole plot, I must have seen it at least 100 times, and I can say it's a good movie for children / family. <Br /> <br /> I still have the tape, I haven't looked at it in 5 years, but maybe I'll go around this week, and I'll be a kid for the day. <br /> <br /> you just have to love the care bears and their messege. <br /> <br />
