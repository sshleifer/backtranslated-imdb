I recently purchased a collection of this fantastic series and, even after watching only three episodes, I am still mesmerized by the elegant style of the animation and the slow but meditative actions of the story. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pains. <br /> <br /> Although this episode of the Gundam saga is very beautiful and has what the previous series had - an elegant satirical way of telling war wrongs and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything (does it sound familiar?), I must say that this becomes a bit too sweet-dramatic in continuing to explain the life of the main characters and their incessant need to do a stomach ache on everything that happens and on what they have do to prevent the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character called Wufei ... I mean that you whine more than an American character in a soap opera. counselor, ya?) <br /> <br /> Also, for the exaggerated drama (I think it comes mainly from the dubbing of the English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will capture me once again. I mean it can always be worse. It could be like the recent episode, SEED ...... eeeewwww, to talk about sweet-dramatic ... I'll talk about it later.
