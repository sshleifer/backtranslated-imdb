One of the great mysteries of life, suffered daily, is the reason why pretty girls are often more interested in jerks and heels than good kids. <br /> <br /> Worse, when the good guys also want to marry those girls, the girls still prefer jerks and heels, even after the jerks and heels showed their contempt, they showed that they're just interested in use girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is the good guy, who continues to be nice after being lied to and deceived and even having lost the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is the asshole, and he is perfect in the role, rather a sad note for his fans. <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow looks like a leaner Mae West, which even sounds like La West in some of his cynical lines of flight. <br /> <br /> A little disconcerting is that so many other characters, I meant to be bad - I mean, hell, they are locked up, so they must be - they are so obviously nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many nice people here, people who, in a film or story, would be snarling and back-stabbing, but here they do everything to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So perhaps the story is rather clich√©, at least by modern standards, but in the end the viewer will be glad to have watched. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that many really good actors are not given credit. Once again, we can say a fervent "Thanks" to IMDb.com.
