*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two so dirty outings ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to have regained the pace in "Sudden Impact", a thrilling thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, which he also directed, and a story that spends enough time at the exhibition and reserves its energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> For once, the case takes Harry out of his native San Francisco (where he is again in trouble with his superiors for his tactics "shoot first, ask questions later"), in the fraction of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is brutally murdered, one at a time, by a woman who was gang raped years earlier, and whose sister is in a catatonic state since the attack. /> <br /> The murderer is played by Sondra Locke and makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold blood. Locke's cold eyes and freezing voice, when they both try to comfort the hospitalized sister or take revenge on the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of an offended woman, whose years of suffering and anger are starting to bear deadly fruit. > <br /> Rapists are a contemptible part, especially the leader, who has "psychopath" practically printed on his forehead, and a lesbian who looks like one of the boys, despite his anatomical inability to participate. The flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are quite nightmare and clearly intended to make Jennifer smile while killing her attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will eliminate "Sudden Impact" as garbage: a mindless mind, manipulative tale of revenge. At a certain level this is true, but it is well made. What works to the benefit of the film is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, which gives us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in his paintings than in his gestures or speeches. What we have here is an action film with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but how the mystery behind the killing becomes clear to Harry (a realization that, wisely, is not explained by dialogue), he is offered a choice - what to do with a killer whose motivations can include, but whose conduct is bound by law not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry stuff. <br /> <br /> The other redeeming quality of the film is Eastwood's direction. This is, after all, a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone. The film is directed with style and wit and modified to give the action scenes a great success. Some of the best "Harry's Moments" of the whole series are here, including Harry's most famous line, "Go ahead, prepare my day". <br /> <br /> "Suddenly impact" is a film that has the courage of its convictions to present a story about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a fascinating police story, well done and well told. And it's certainly never boring. On those criteria, it is tremendously successful.
