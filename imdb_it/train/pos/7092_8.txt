There is a story (perhaps apocryphal) about a trade between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (presumably) produced a long list (think of the aircraft of the fifth element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was called "Things that Bruce Willis does when he acts." It ended with a simple message that said "please do nothing of the above in my film". <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this film (certainly true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I would say that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are what we rightly expect from a Gilliam film. He is also full of gilliamesco surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam enjoys putting her audience down. Although the end of the Twelve monkeys will not surprise anyone who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the bureaucratic, relentless and bureaucratic movement of the characters to their fate. It is this journey, and the developments of the character they undergo, that upsets. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam's films (especially Brazil). But everyone tends to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there is no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the triumph department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way that is usually not seen in the former Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumors above, Gilliam also manages to get a top-notch (and very atypical) performance out of the bald. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the casts, especially a novice - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I looked at it again, I knew he hadn't really aged. I had changed, of course. And that made me watch the movie with new eyes. This seems to me an adequate tribute to a film that, at least in part, concerns reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey in the time we all do. A first-rate film. 8/10.
