I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if you don't bear any resemblance to them, I didn't notice. I like the quality of the cinematographic storybook. I also like the love story, even though while I'm enjoying myself I mostly wonder how the hell that part of the story can really develop since Ned can't touch Chuck or anything ... well, you know. I also like Chuck, I don't find it at all annoying and I generally hate excessively sweet, beautiful and perfect characters. I also like the narrator's voice, although it disturbs one of my family members and shows some resemblance to some Walgreens commercials. I could mess up all the other things about Ned's situation and how writers will deal with it in the future, but I prefer to watch and wait and see what the writers are doing.
