The 1986 TV movie of The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. However, Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the film and therefore no series was produced. I thought it was a very funny movie and captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry that it didn't materialize in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect spirit. Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and, of course, would later move to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of the big screen version of Frank Miller of The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare gem in the history of the Spirit. It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie with an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably look for older versions of the property and publish it on video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas put on Zorro's mask, we were able to get older versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as the Alain Delon version of the 70s (although all the copies I saw were badly modified). He hopes someone will soon release The Spirit to DVD television adventure.
