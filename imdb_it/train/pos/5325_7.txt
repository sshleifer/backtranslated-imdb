The idea of ​​making a film about the Beatles sounds like a dead idea, since no production can capture the idea of ​​the current historical Beatles. So it's better not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works better with the other available material of the Beatles. This is exactly what "The Birth of the Beatles" offers us, the simple story known to us without extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here on *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is as precise as some Beatles graduates might expect. The Beatles are seen performing in songs that were barely even composed from that time. The Beatles perform "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and even "Do not Bother Me". Beatles graduates should see that if the film's Beatles only performed songs they actually did in Hamburg, younger viewers might no longer recognize the Beatles who learned to know them. Only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sutcliffe are preserved from that original Hamburg repertoire. <br /> <br /> The boys who play the Beatles in this production do not resemble the originals, but the rest of the film continues to be well regarded since the film is otherwise quite accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it well and the rest of the band isn't bad either. Brian Epstein is fantastic and the moment he fires Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film. Also as a bonus you can see the original Cavern club in the movie.
