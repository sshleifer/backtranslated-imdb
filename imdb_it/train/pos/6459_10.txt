Returning to the roots with "as if it were in paradise" - what are the true values ​​of life? These Swedes cut out a message that attracts every heart. We have seen it twice in a cinema full to the last place: pure love and joy in the music of a choir that is simple but full of energy when everyone finds his inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the sparkle of fame to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after the collapse on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is attracted by the lives of simple people, warm and rough of the North. <br /> <br /> It wins hearts with music and acquires the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Don't go see it if you've been used to Hollywood. This stuff contains no extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
