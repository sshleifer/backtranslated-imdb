Robber hack idiots, a child, a safe, a piano and a child. Add them all and get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with some star power a-list (at least one-minus ... okay, b-plus?) this film received very little publicity. <br /> <br /> But this does not detract from his genius. <br /> <br /> Terrifying writing, solid delivery and a group of believable characters. Some really classic lines, and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a "Nutty Professor" watered-down comedy. These are bad for low life. They speak a man's language of small stature and do bad things of low life. But they do it for your enjoyment and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
