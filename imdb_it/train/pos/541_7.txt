like a sequel, this is not a bad movie. Actually I liked it a lot more than the first one. I found it more fun. It seems to have been shot in documentary style. First it bothered me, because I thought it was too low budget. But it grew on me, and it made the movie look more authentic. This film has a drier lining than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. I think that sometimes they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the personas.it almost becomes a parody of himself, which could be the point. This film has at least some suspense, which the first does not had, in my view.it has some of the same great music from the original, which is fantastic. The acting again was pretty decent for the most part, although as I said, some of them seemed exaggerated. I also heard that the film loses much momentum towards the end and there are some minutes that seem really slow and don't seem to flow, like the rest of the film. However, I thought it was a sequel.m Evaluation of "Return to the cabin on the lake" is 7/10 *
