This film is a lyrical and romantic memory told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy who lives in a rural Cuban city the year of the Castro revolution. It is obviously a genuine and worthy work of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are only attempts to mis-market it as an action movie. DREAMING OF JULIA makes a lot more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is only an inconvenience for people's daily lives and activities. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works that deal with this period of Cuban history. <br /> <br /> Excessive use of the off-screen narrator undermines the story but the film compensates for this with an unqualified qualification clip from Hollywood films that say much more visually than the narrator could. <br /> <br /> The comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO are an honest game since the film is melancholy on the films, but there is a pain at the base of a lifestyle that overcomes the lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending.
