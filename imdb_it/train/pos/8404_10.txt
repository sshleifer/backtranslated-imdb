Drive-in movies of common sense but good character, about a simple middle school student who dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as a "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings to buy the vehicle of his dreams. Joint sharing and love quickly begin with the girls that Bobby has collected in the local pizzeria, but he finds that many responsibilities, dangers and anxiety stem from being the owner of such a mechanical wonder. <br /> <br /> The Van is my guilty pleasure. It captures the relaxed mood of the mid-70s and has unintentional humor sufficient to put him in the "so bad is good" category.
