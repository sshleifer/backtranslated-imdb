Imagine the difficult situation of Richard, a painter, whose real passion is flying. When we meet him for the first time, he is seen on top of a London building with homemade wings. He tore his canvases and other works, at the height of his desperation, and models a flying device for his jump. When he falls into the protective police device, he does not suffer a scratch, but lands him in front of a judge who orders him to serve in the community. Richard, whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly, decides to move to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he intends to use to build his plane. <br /> <br /> Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman with A.L.S., or Lou Gehrig's disease, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely intelligent, but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. Use a portable device to talk sometimes, as his speech is unclear. What Jane loves to do is lose her virginity, at any cost. Jane and Richard clash as they meet, but mutual tolerance soon puts them at ease. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches porn on her computer, has the idea of ​​finding someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo", who, for a fee, will have sex with her. When Richard takes her to London, they find the right man for the job. His quota is exorbitant, but I agree. Since they have no money, Richard decides to rob a large bank. Unfortunately, things don't go according to plan when Jane realizes she can't go all the way with what she wants. In the end, Richard takes Jane to take a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of his life, something that brings them closer, as they find an affinity with one another. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass directed this eccentric film that presents an unusual situation. Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine of traditional films, yet, she has such a sweet aura for her that it's hard not to try for her and what she's trying to accomplish. Mr. Greengrass shows a material affinity of Richar Hawkins who wrote for the film. The film does not try to be nice or give a rosy image of a young woman suffering from an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching the film. She makes a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh doesn't seem too suitable for this kind of comedy. Somehow, he has problems with the way he plays Richard. Gemma Jones has some good moments like Anne, Richard's former love. <br /> <br /> "The Theory of Flight" shows a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things.
