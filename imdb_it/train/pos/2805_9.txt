Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie. I've never been able to watch it. The plot has nothing to interest me. I don't know anything about football (soccer). I'm one of those American fools who have no idea. I had never seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this movie the moment it was released in America. Enough with me. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of cinematic paradise. What a funny movie. It is full of color and exuberance. I had a funny smile on my face throughout the movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can't help cheering on her. No wonder the American television program E.R. stole it. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. These people know how to have fun. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was deciphering some slang and British dialogues through accents. I activated the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the film!) I am sure that audiences around the world find it difficult to understand the constantly changing jargon in American films. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. He has a great sporting story like Rocky and a strong sense of feminism that empowers women. I watched it with my wife and sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
