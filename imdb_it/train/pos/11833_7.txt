White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula In fact, in the past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it. However, having said that, I think the film succeeds in overcoming trivial politicization because it plays on the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. You may not be in line with the junk revisionism of the film about how the West was won, and lost. But anyone can feel a sense of desire for the days when horses could run free in the western plains. (The film also avoids that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation, especially the opening one, is incredible.
