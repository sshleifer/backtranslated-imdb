... I saw it on the cable in the late 80s since I was a big fan of wrestling since 1986. I saw it on VHS in a "sale" basket and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and always came back to watch this to see how it was a very accurate portrait of people involved in wrestling (families and friends who didn't understand us, the journey, the heartbreak, etc.). Henry Winkler is fun and sometimes sad to look at because no one else can figure out which genius is creative. A great way to separate. The character of Fonz who played Happy Days at that time. Also, watch the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and wrestling wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get the chance, watch it.
