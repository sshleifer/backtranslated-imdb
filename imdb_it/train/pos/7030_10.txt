We recorded this when it aired on TV in 1995 and we waited all these years for its release, because it quickly became one of our family favorites. The children are now teenagers and must have seen a time of bilions, but they still look at him religiously with friends. Its timeless appeal reaches groups of all ages - similar to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander delicious and wonderfully light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this site are rather rude to him, but our family gives him the best grades. (We loved his "Giant Step" number.) Marc Kudisch (like Conrad) provides us with comic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was Kim's performance of Chynna Philip. Part of this has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. To complicate matters, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, incredible and simply horrible. The director should have seen it and corrected it. Or he never launched it to begin with. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, the image is delicious and I highly recommend it to families of all ages.
