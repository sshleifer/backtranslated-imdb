I loved this movie! I'm a real Tom Hanks fan, and I've always been impressed with all his work. From his most dramatic roles as Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. To his hilarious roles as A League of Their Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big and, of course, Toy Story. But in this movie Hanks is not the only great actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an emerging star who shows great promise in Hollywood stars as a son of Hanks and offers exceptional performance. He is certainly someone to watch out for throughout his career, I think he will do great things. Paul Newman always offers a brilliant screen performance. It is truly a legend. We can't forget the people who didn't have such important roles in the film, but they still helped us make it fantastic. The beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose performance in Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Female will never forget, brings her grace to the screen like Hank's wife in the film and does a great job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the film. He does a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I Dreamed Of Africa, he gives a great interpretation.
