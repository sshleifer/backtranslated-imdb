I read the other reviews and found some comparisons between real film and real life (eg. What it takes to enter the music school), Britney Bashing, etc. Etc. So let's focus on the film and the message. <Br /> <br /> I rated this film 7 out of 10 for the age group between 8 and 14 and for a family film. For the average adult male .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I am 45 years old. I know Britney Spears but I never noticed that she sang Stronger until I read the credits and these reviews. I didn't recognize his poster on the wall, so I wasn't worried about any 'self promotion'. <br /> <br /> I watch movies for fun. I'm not interested in casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the film and entertains me. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the message. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is another story), so look at the message in mind, as this is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and airy, great for children. I discovered that the Texan twang began to fade throughout the film and of course there are only so many ways to convey the message of giving up / not giving up, so it was a bit predictable. A great message though ... it should be more than them. <br /> <br /> This film is a great family film, but for a guy who looks alone, take Hannibal.
