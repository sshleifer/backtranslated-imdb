This film takes you so deeply into the two main characters. I put it in my laptop without even reading the cover (not to mention the reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that develops between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without almost any physical contact. Towards the end I couldn't decide which one I wanted the most: our hero and heroine would take out their capers or simply consume their passion. RML could have done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been abundant. I'm doing the hair anyway. After a series of films by Netflix, Blockbuster and a local library, this film has restored my great film production.
