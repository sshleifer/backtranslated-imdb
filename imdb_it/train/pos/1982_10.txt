This was my favorite movie as a child, and I have been a few times in stage production, so it will always remain my favorite in the music field and I doubt anyone could ever reconstruct the Oliver Twist story on screen, better than this did. <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite '' bad guy '' must be Oliver Reed like Bill Sikes. Not only did it frighten my life when I saw him as a 6-year-old boy, but now as a woman I can tune into the character of Nancys, the bar-maid / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wilde as the astute evader, it was fantastic, and I don't think anyone could ever get out of it, like Fagin's ticket collector and best friend. The music is fantastic, especially the Fagin numbers, I'm also grateful that they didn't give Bill Sikes a musical number, it wouldn't work with him being such a sinister character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job with Nancy's sticky ending, keeping it a G-class movie, disguising her beatings, but giving enough away to show Bill's violence to her. <br /> <br /> This film is both fascinating and charismatic as a musical chant, as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy trying to find out where he is in life.
