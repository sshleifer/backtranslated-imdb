Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is the most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent something more than vivid nightmares, Lynch offers a reflexive and fragile meditation on the universal themes of aging and the family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) riding a lawn mower in Wisconsin to visit his stricken alien brother, there are still many of the unique and original visual landscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heart, filmed by the veteran filmmaker Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable effort and characterization of Lynch that are among his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic but attractive way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns into some of her best works in a minor role of her mentally challenged but observant daughter (the whose painful secret is revealed in a moving way through a delicate turn in the sensitive screenplay by John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of a person's small cast offers indelible shows, one of the most notable is Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is at the same time tumultuous and sad at the same time. But it's vintage Lynch with its ability to engage and destabilize you to the fullest. For those who do not know Lynch or know him only for his violent and disturbing reputation, this is a great starting point; for those who know his work, this is one of the best in his repertoire.
