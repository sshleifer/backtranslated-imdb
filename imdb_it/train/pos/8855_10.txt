Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still has the game! A few years ago he shot "Find Me Guilty", a test for everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act, if he has the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. But he is still going strong, his next film has already been announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stay with this film right here. The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. The small nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogues and / or situations that evolve in the film are simply fantastic. The (temporal) structure of the film, which holds the toes all the time, fusing the lines of time so evenly, that the editing seems natural / impeccable. The story is enhanced by this, even if even in a "normal" time frame, it would have been at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only recommend it highly, the rest is up to you! : OR)
