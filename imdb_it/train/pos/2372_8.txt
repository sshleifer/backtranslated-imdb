I only watched this after my mother brought it back to me from America, I was afraid I looked at this after all the negative comments here, but I have to say that yes, acting is poor, some of the effects are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But you must remember that this must have been 1898, not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was good enough. I liked this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I have read the book so many times and found myself saying "ah yes it is in the book" almost always, with the other version there was practically nothing in the book. <br /> <br /> So well done at least trying to make a real version.
