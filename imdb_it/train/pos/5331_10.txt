just watched on Sky TV lost the first half hour. I was wondering if it was a true story, so I looked at it until the end. there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone. it reminded me of speed but at the end of the day I don't think it was released at the cinema, as we saw the following error. the worst thing we have seen is that they remove the bonnet (bonnet) and then there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the hood is turned on again. made me stand on the edge of my seat especially when I thought the child would hit the bridge and, of course, when the bridge would not lower and so it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears, so it wasn't so bad !!!!
