gone in 60 sec. from where I started, it keeps you in the movie with a good action and some nice cars. people say it's not a good movie, I don't agree that it has some tasteful parts, but what the action movie doesn't do. I gave him a cause of the action on 8 and the relief of the comics if you like the Rock or Face Off of this movie is exactly like your cage to relieve a good job together with one of the most underrated actors in my mind -Roy Lindo . I think sometimes people look too far into the movies sometimes that you need to sit down and enjoy the movie and after the words ask you they've done what they show. meaning if to them where to go for action was an action pact. if they tried to make a movie to change the way movies are made and try to win every prize, did they do? I think they made the action movie they decided to make, give it a chance and you won't mind.
