Catscratch is the best thing to get out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show is not only aimed at Maoris and PI. some people love it, and they're all Australians. At first glance I admit that it looks a little rough, but it grows enormously on you. Also, to correct something that one of the other critics said In_Correct (Tv.com) doesn't say "Does that mean you're homo now?" he says "Does that mean you're homo, owww?" This is his phrase in the show. Mr. Blik is, I think, the most fun of all as Peww-Weww's Playhouse <br /> <br /> First, I admit that the first episode was a little good. But after a while the episodes became fantastic! And just when the series found it's surreal, eccentric ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is meant for children, but sometimes a brilliant show appears that can be appreciated by teenagers and adults. These shows include Mr. Bean the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes) and Invader Zim. All of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to delete them. <br /> <br /> What I like about the famous final episode, where Gordon fights a duck. /> <br /> I'd also like to see a DVD, with lots of audio commentaries and backstage showers, including the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, what I have I would certainly like to see the show come back on the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the closing credits for the gag. It would be great.
