Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from very different backgrounds, he is American and she is French, after talking a little on the train, Jesse manages to take Celine off the train and explore Vienna with him. During the next few hours the two will wander around in Vienna taking everything the city has to offer and will be madly angry with each other. But this new relationship will last until dawn. <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air for a genre that has been in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" never gets bored because of his "little cast". In fact it flourishes thanks to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Smart dialogue makes it a must for romanticism fans.
