I have to agree with everyone else who posted. <br /> <br /> I looked at it a while ago, but I'll tell you that, every time I hear certain musics of this anime, I remember the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I felt watching him, and makes me cry (a feeling so happy but sad). However, I find that the love story contained in it was rather hasty and that they did not explain things correctly, but it did not ruin any part of the visual experience. <br /> <br /> I was in this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research (and watch the ending a few more times) and found all my answers and more. I like how they configured historical legends to adapt to this anime, it was fantastic and made me want to do a lot more research (I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> that should have been a longer series, but if that's all they had to work with, they pulled it off well. I would recommend it to everyone who likes emotional souls with an excellent story, well-structured characters (some mysterious) and some fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, although this was based on an H-game, it has none of those things in it and I actually prefer it that way. (I have no problems with mature souls, in most cases I prefer it)
