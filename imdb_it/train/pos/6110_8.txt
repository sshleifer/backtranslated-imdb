Like "My Sassy Girl", this film is based on a true story published by the Internet, but that's where the similarities end. The story generally concerns this rebellious boy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a background poor, but seems to be the same age as him. Add to this some obstacles, martial arts (the hooligans always follow Ji-Hoon for revenge), a sick and speechless girl who takes care of him, his propensity to give up lessons, and you can generally guess the whole story. Did I mention that it's a romantic comedy? This film has some good fighting scenes, great visual humor and lots of spunk, thanks to the good understanding between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which bring a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work for this reason. And I must say, I'd like a girl more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from "My Sassy Girl" (at least as far as personality is concerned). She has some sperm, but is more on the cute way, sweet, good heart. The characters are already mostly nice (so you could say that he had less than a hill to climb of "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked for that film to his credit), and the film is quite intelligent and interesting for most. The type of history of declines, however, is about 2/3 (where it is a sort of tread on a standard, familiar tariff, where nothing really interesting happens), but towards the end it picks up a little. Overall, a fun and cute movie. 8/10
