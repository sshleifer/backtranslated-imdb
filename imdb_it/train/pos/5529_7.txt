I first saw this film in a theater in France about a year ago. He came and went with a small fanfare, but I liked him for the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating naturalistic movie. (The story, though pretty, is really random. If you really thought about it, it's not possible that most of what could happen in real life.) I saw it again tonight, here in the United States, on DVD. Once again, I realized that it has a very limited distribution. The blockbusters only had one copy, and I don't remember ever playing in the Cleveland art houses. <br /> <br /> Seen on my TV, the photograph is not so breathtaking, even though it is still very beautiful. The wildlife footage is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time, when you know where it is headed. <br /> <br /> However, as I said, the story is incidental. It's a great movie to watch, and if you like wildlife footage, you should find this fascinating.
