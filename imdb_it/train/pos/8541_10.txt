I know, that's not what you expect from a film with this kind of lineage <br /> <br /> - it's a direct descendant of The Best Years of Our Lives <br /> and The Men .. films that treat men who are in the hospital <br /> <br /> who deal with tragic circumstances. But this film is full of wonderful <br /> <br /> surprises and shows. Presents stellar performances by Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a rather risque nude scene) <br /> <br /> and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrote <br /> <br /> in his book Cinema of Outsiders (on the independent film <br /> <br />) "The Waterdance is consistent, attentive to detail, and <br /> <br /> not sentimental with a humble evil on the humorous ground, he is both likeable and sad, and the whole cast is impressive. "I was extraordinarily moved by this film, it is hard to hit yes, but it also has very tender moments and resound strong moments . A rare gem.
