What I like about you is one of those series that you have to see but you are not sure you would see it, the beginning is beautiful and it sucks you in the series just for fun, the second part in the second and third season which are more stale, they come and go in whatever you want. what happens with many series is that they do not end up with something special because the second part of the series always goes down the drain, even that did a little, the third part is to ruin and ruin the entire series, usually, but it is not so, this ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, in reality I was rather angry for all these guys in Val's life, actually I wanted to end up with Jeff at the end, but later he changed, they chose to bring Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go to the top. <br /> <br /> seeing it many times the series is actually very beautiful, expect the second part to be so good that it is not so, but the third part does what was necessary and made the series one that was worth the I am happy to say that I am happy and happy about the series and now I will go to see two boys, a girl and a pizzeria, when I see the whole series I will come back ...
