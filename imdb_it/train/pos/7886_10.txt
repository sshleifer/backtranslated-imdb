Ok, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says this is the worst! But it is not !!! Haven't you seen Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! This was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and sticks to the story of Freddy and it's nice that he had a daughter etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> And then I discovered it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember when I saw it on the DVD box I instantly jumped into 3D sequences. Much has been in 3-D like the hand of Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean with a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head that explodes. <br /> <I really loved this movie because it was 3-D, but I wish the whole movie was in 3-D not just in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the Way it's 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
