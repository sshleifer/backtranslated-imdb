I have not often had the feeling of a film that could be visionary. But clearly this film has the seed of a premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not be alarmist and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. But, didn't we say this of "1984"? James Orwell had never seen the Internet become a reality not long after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; he could reconsider writing his story as he did. Award-winning final vision. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter. What matters is that we often consider ourselves superior to what surrounds us, but in fact we become emotional for an "apple of love" when necessity knocks on our door. A snapshot of ourselves in old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the time line that turns out to be for us, I know for sure that we haven't seen the beginning yet. <br /> <br />
