Most people chasing films with Audrey Tautou seem not to understand that Amelie was a character - it's not really the true personality of Audrey Tautou, therefore, every film in which she participates will not be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now, with that said, I too took this movie simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene where you don't see for about 45 minutes, but I didn't miss it either because I was having so much fun with the other characters. The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies the people who finish his coffee and jumps out into the account finding coupons and such that balance the loss, actually ... getting into all the characters here might take it a little bit, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The character of Audrey Tautou, Irene, is not Amelie's overly sweet girl. In fact, like Irene, her rudeness towards a homeless man who asked for the change caught me off guard at the beginning. In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but during a (very terrible) day, her disposition becomes more and more bitter and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building ... very fun to watch, fantastic scenarios and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all the characters they can actually act. The best part of the film comes with about 20 minutes remaining .... this is when all the plots start to mesh together and the turn really takes everything and everything ties and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms. I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film I've seen in a while and the ending ... It made me think "damn, I'm really lucky to find this movie". The end of this film is top notch. Anyone who has written the script for this is brilliant, because not only are all these other subplots in progress, but somehow making them all join together (and in a reasonable way, as is the case here) but also to make every human character feel and become alive, not just a stale character used as a crutch to build this whole butterfly effect ... really impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film because it is a great movie to watch at any time, in any mood, with any company or alone.
