The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is a real story, almost as wonderful as the one told in this film. Alexander Korda almost went bankrupt to make this film. <br /> <br /> According to the Citadel Film Book series on The Great British Films, the UK's adopted son, Alexander Korda conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years planning and preparing. But the second world war unfortunately reached Korda and the increasing expenses to shoot a great show. <br /> <br /> Budget costs also occur in American films, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932, when he returned there. But DeMille and none of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs during the filming of the film. Part of the shoot, Korda transported the entire company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as a genius in our Grand Canyon. He certainly would not have had such scenarios in the UK. Korda also finished the Hollywood interiors, in time for a 1940 Christmas Christmas publication. <br /> <br /> The Thief of Bagdad's performance earned four Oscar nominations and three Academy Awards for the better color cinematography, better art and direction for color film and better special effects. Only the original soundtrack by Miklos Rosza did not bring home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been really happy to have decided to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color photos from that place. <br /> <br /> The special effects, however, do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumph over evil. The beauty is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the villain is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidt's career role up to Casablanca, where he played the great Luftwaffe Stroesser. <br /> <br /> Obviously the good gets a little help from an unlikely source. The beggar boy and the thief Sabu, who could very well have been one of the few who could be called an international movie star at the time. Literally raised by poverty working as a baby elephant for the Maharajah of Mysore, he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native guide for one of his aspects of the jungle. Sabu captures all the innocence and malice of youth while he realizes the fantasy of the Thousand and One Nights of the boy who drops a tyrant. It's not a bad message for 1940. <br /> <br /> The Baghdad thief holds up very well today. It is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in whatever order you want to put it.
