It took a long time to find the title in a special video library in Berlin, and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think it's one of the best horrormovies of all time. It seems strange to me that some people call this film a black comedy. I have to admit, I wasn't able to laugh when I first saw it (and it was the same thing the second time!) On the one hand Trelkovski looks so cute and cute in his shy behavior, but on the other side he beat this guy in the playground and there's no explanation for that. But the most unwelcome thing is obviously his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he doesn't know, who he really is. His allusions are the most terrifying of this film. Of course it's all in his mind, but it's this dish that brings out this feminine side of him or even was before he moved - I think it's an interesting question. His shizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other. The result is that he cuts his hand first and then jumps out of his window. But this terrible cry - does it mean that everything will repeat again and again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphics and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mom in the hospital - it's not an accident, but a clue in my point of view.
