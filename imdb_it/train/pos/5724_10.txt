Massive chills along the spine! I'm surprised there are people who didn't like it! I saw him at 10 am and I still got scared! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! To shout loudly, I'm 22! I mean, OK, dubbing, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine aspect of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the beginning, hitting you again and again with relentless, ruthless and terrifying scenes! So many clich√©s yet no one can surprise / scare! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump out of the chair. Grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and don't watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese!
