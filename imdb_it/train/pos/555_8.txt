My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I couldn't find a place for this. I was really surprised to see that this film was released in the United States in February 1955. I saw it in a "first-run" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. I wonder if it was re-released, or any problems? In my opinion, this film is a very light entertainment, but it has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a tough job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan has pretty much the same role he had in Red River years ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart offers an excellent performance like never before. I've seen this movie a half dozen times or more, and I never tire of seeing it again. Photography and scenery are splendid and offer a considerable amount of entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
