Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child offers all this in a single well-made film! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who befriends a Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows over time but as Sho gets older, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It doesn't help that both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. It is a moving, mature story with human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry again. Even if you are not a fan of their music, WATCH THIS FILM. Works great like a stand-alone Vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
