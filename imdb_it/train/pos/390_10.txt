The first thing I thought when I saw these films was: it's not really a movie, at least it's not what we spontaneously imagine when we hear the word "film". it is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So, if you're not used to expressing things symbolically, you'll find it strange, if you don't know philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you'll think it's just a fairy tale ... and even strange, chaotic. For me "The legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like. He tells us in images the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle that is as old as humanity, and all those who are searching for meaning in this life find themselves facing it. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the view of the world and of humans are different. But as much as we are all human and have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and we can understand each other. It's a really beautiful movie! And I of which we had more films like this - films that have meaning. There are too many empty stories that are good only to pass the time faster.
