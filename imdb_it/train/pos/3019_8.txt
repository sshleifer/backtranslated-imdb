To begin with, I loved göta kanal 1, it had a lot of classic jokes including the unfortunate one in a canoe that always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's still playing the same guy in the göta kanal 2 movie, but I don't think the performance it's as funny as in the first movie, in fact you don't notice it at all. One thing that made me think about this film is the choice of boats, in this film there are only racing boats, they are certainly fast but those don't make waves like the big houseboats used in the first film, I liked the old ones the best ones and these new boats make one of the last scenes ridiculous when the man in a canoe suddenly jumps out to escape the "big waves" of those small fast boats. Really a minus. You must accept that we no longer live in the same Sweden of 1974. This film also contains a little more violence than the first. Although the film was great overall. I just focused on some disadvantages that I was disappointed with, but the rest of the film lived up to my expectations, so go see it! It's worth it.
