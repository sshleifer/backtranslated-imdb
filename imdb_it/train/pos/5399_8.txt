The last great Gosha film of the 1960s. A determined stylist with a great sense of purpose for his films, Gosha collaborated with Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi's fame) to produce this frowning accusation of mindless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (heavenly judgment) is the word that the emperor's loyalists shout as he murders enemies or "traitors" to the cause. Katsu interprets his simple political alliance with a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questions the politician is labeled a "traitor" and becomes a killer target. <br /> <br /> One of the best films ever photographed, many shots are incredible compositions of shape, color and light. The fighting scenes are frequent, very bloody and brutal. Blood becomes a part of the palette of colors that Gosha uses for his images. Splendid and disturbing. While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in Japan would be very useful, you can fight through the film without it. The few drawbacks of the film are the musical track, the length and occasional scenery of Katsu chewing. He has a drunken scene that is really the best for a movie, but actually a very accurate representation of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Downbeat but one of the great films of Chambara.
