I know some people think the movie is boring, but I don't agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and thought that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity. I don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detail of someone's life, but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what could be more fascinating than someone who successfully reinvents himself? "Men become what they dream - you dreamed well". Good job to Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand stood out for me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in other films.
