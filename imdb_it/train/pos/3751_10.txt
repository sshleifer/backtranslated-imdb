I know you've already joined this in film festivals (or at least I think you did, maybe I'm making it up) but I think this should be the "best animated short film" in all of them. Good boy. I can't wait to see the full movie. I realize that you may not hear it often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but listen to it now and accept it as the truth. Congratulations, my friend. Ok, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Even if I still mean it. And here comes yet another -SHOE! - and I can't stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have a lot. <br /> <br /> -R
