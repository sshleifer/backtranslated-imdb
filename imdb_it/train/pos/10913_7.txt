William Powell is a doctor in charge of a murder and ex-wife in "The ex-Mrs. Bradford", also played by Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry with almost all the women he was with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect pair on the screen, the actor made a couple of other films like "Thin Man", one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both with a great effect. <br /> <br /> Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell a witty and casual professional and "The Ex-Mrs Bradford" is no exception. The ex-Mrs. B has Mr. B served with a subpoena for food for the back and then comes back to help him solve a mystery in which she dragged him. And this is not the first time he has done it! It almost seems like there was a "Bradford" movie before this or that this was destined to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his former mystery writer is constantly bringing him into question. This time, a jockey who rides his favorite horse in a hike mysteriously falls from the horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution to the case is quite extravagant, but it is out of the question. The point is the quarrel between the couple and the ex-lady's interference. B. Jean Arthur is quite fascinating in his role and very funny. However, with an actress who proves as clever as Arthur, humor seems intentional rather than lazy. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - for example, the extravagant side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur learns that the police arrived, she says "Ah, it's probably my food, I waited for the police to take a hand", it's more of a rib in Powell than a serious statement. It still works well, and shows how a good actress can do her part. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth looking at, as were always William Powell and Jean Arthur.
