I saw this movie when I was about 7 years old - 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply moved and moved by the brave boy and the beautiful eagle. And I couldn't believe it when it turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he would die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered of the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it as we only saw it yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is to see !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it, just like me and my sister ...
