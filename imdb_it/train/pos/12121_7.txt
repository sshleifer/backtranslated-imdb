Somerset Maugham's characters are featured in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; but the film is a too skeletal version of the novel, with Bette Davis' star performance sucking up all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but he is told that he has no talent for the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard instead fights to become a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice about the arts; although successful in medicine, his painting seemed simpler - he also observes the symbolism of his disability, a "clubfoot" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> Along the way (immediately, in this version), Howard becomes infatuated with the maid Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis's characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech, when he tells Howard, among other things, that he had to "WIPE MY MOUTH!" after kissing him Howard behaves well, but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis; therefore, their performance is wasted. <br /> <br /> Again, a movie to watch for acting, including some good support players. The characterization of Bette Davis was famous for having inspired a "write-in" campaign for the Oscar-winning "Best Actress" of 1934. For the record, she placed third. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It happened one night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br / > 3. Bette Davis - "Of Human Bondage" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* Of Human Bondage (28 / 06/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
