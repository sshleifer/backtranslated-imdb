Despite what the title may imply, "Pigs Is Pigs" is not the protagonist of Porky Pig. Rather, he presents a young pig with a more insatiable appetite than the character of John Belushi in "Animal House". His mother repeatedly scolds him, but it serves no purpose. So much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist forcefully feeds him more than any mortal can handle (but there is a surprise in the end). <br /> <br /> I would say mostly that this cardboard looked like a placeholder between the big cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after it came out). But make no mistake, they do beautiful things here. The entire force feeding sequence seems more relevant today, given the obesity epidemic that has overtaken our country. <br /> <br /> However, it's not the biggest cartoon, but it's worth seeing.
