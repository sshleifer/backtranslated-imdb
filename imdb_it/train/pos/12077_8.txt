I really enjoyed this 1945 yellow film about a young woman, Nina Foch (Julia Ross) who is out of work and lagged behind in her rent and is desperate for a job. Julia reads an announcement in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try to get this position. Julia gets the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who demands that she live with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with male friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote all the time to this work. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange wishes for playing with knives. It was a low-budget film and most of the scenes were in the foreground to avoid expense in terms of background and cost for the scenario. This strange family lives in a huge mansion off the coast of Cornwall, England, and has secret doors and lots of suspense.
