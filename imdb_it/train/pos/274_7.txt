I look at most of the films Nick Mancuso is in because, frankly, I love the boy, even though over the years he is interpreted as the villain (longtime fans should note that for some reason he is blond in this film) . It's a fairly familiar film in terms of plot (but most of the films these days aren't exactly original), but Rick Roberts is as attractive as the imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is just as attractive as her daughter, and Mitzi Kapture makes a good work, if that was his goal, to be angry and sometimes rather difficult to love. Nick still understood in terms of his ability to demonstrate both fascination and psychosis. However, too much plot takes place off screen - like motivation, previous behavior, good times and bad times - and the things that seem apparent to the characters never reach the public (ie me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "what to say ..." category, and overall, I can't say that I cared much about any of the characters. That being said, it was what it was - a reasonably fun way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
