I thought the original of this film was bizarre and fascinating as well as making me sit on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Since I had already seen the original, when I saw it on the Sci Fi Channel - I don't know if this remake was made specifically for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as an actor, I wanted to see how he could do it. <br /> <br /> Writers / producers, etc., have modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the "alien" situation "(they could no longer reproduce their type and need help) using the same pseudo -science that was crammed into our ears in the 90s. Maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Movies? This production takes on a more sinister edge than the original one - The original ended with a clash between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of the genre took place, although no resolution of the Alien problem. <br /> <br /> I remember that in this remake the woman became quite hostile towards the Burgi / Alien, I think it could have ended better, but the ending is just the end, and the yarn is a wavy yarn, being of the 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock basis. science fiction was written in the 50s and some of them are even arri you go to the cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful thing to look at like a rainy day or something. I consider it highly so of all the remakes of the old Sci Fi 50s, this came along well. I really liked it a little. <br /> <br /> But if someone really wants to see this story told at WELL, I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
