It's not a bright idea to watch Hundstage if you're not 100% sure of your mental stability, because it will be severely tested with this film, no matter how sane you are. I must say that Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so most viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to reach its delightful side. A bit like Tarkovsky's films, but different in a certain sense. I, myself, cannot say that I enjoyed watching it. But it is an exceptional and very interesting experience for those who are just tormented by the clich√© that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger in your brain and gratifies your mind everywhere. You can't just sit and watch it, you'll use exclamations or you'll look wide-eyed throughout the movie. A film that is similar to this in style is Nachtgestalten, but it was noticeably better, and decidedly less violent. This, for example, is not for children or for those who are mentally tender or in a bad mood. Most viewers would probably give a 10 or a 1 to this movie. I give him a 9 because I saw the phenomenon of multiple stories in a movie in another film and it was better. But this is an exceptional piece on its own. Worth looking at, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
