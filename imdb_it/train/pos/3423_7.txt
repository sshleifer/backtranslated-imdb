Don't expect a representation of the "truth". However, the reports of these veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan require a considered consideration. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these veterinarians and their post-war struggles to rebuild a certain degree of normality and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My main criticisms of the film are twofold: it is unilateral and defends anti-war activism, but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of military and veteran affairs programs to help those who " they suffered and still suffer from the traumas of war. These are NOT fatal flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> As a veteran, I know that the horrific consequences of the war are real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. These veterinarians vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people have to understand why the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
