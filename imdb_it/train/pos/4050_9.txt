Anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless little treasure that should be limited to car movies and romantic comedies. This film is compelling and doesn't have a boring moment. Why? Because it largely includes an intelligent dialogue between real people at a time of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis. I repeat: intelligent dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all of Rohmer's films, which is why many people don't like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to look for movies like this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talkative". Well, it is, but to me it's a compliment, not a criticism. Even Shakespeare was a little convinced. Is there a more talking comedy about "Hamlet?" Whenever the subject, or theme, of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values, there must necessarily be a discussion of these ideas and values, and this is largely what this film is about. Aristocracy and noble birth against egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who owns that life is not so beautiful, or even despicable. (Has anyone ever heard of Dostoyevsky, or "Crime and Punishment?") Here's what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as a second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this compelling movie. It could be the last movie on this Master screen.
