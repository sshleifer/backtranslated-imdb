The story of the first "Columbo" television episode is simple: half the success of the mysterious writing team eliminates the other, frames a group of invisible mafia, is blackmailed by an admirer, eliminates the admirer and is deceived by the brave Columbo. <br /> <br /> That said, this is still one of the most enjoyable in the history of the series, benefiting enormously from the work of the late Jack Cassidy and star Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> In addition to the notability of being directed by a young Steven Spielberg, the episode also has a gruesome air due to the future of two of its protagonists: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. The two share several scenes together and it is moving that both of them will die tragically within a decade of these shootings, Cassidy in an apartment fire and Colby at the hands of the assailants, still to be found after over thirty years. <br /> <br /> Now, both defeats are real MYSTERIES of life!
