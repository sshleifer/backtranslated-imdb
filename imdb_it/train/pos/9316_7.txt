Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who comes across a criminal case in "The Unknown Man", a 1951 film with Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case that defends a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), accused of murder and acquits him. Shortly thereafter, he realizes that the man is guilty and is extorting protective money from his victim and other neighborhood shopkeepers. It is recommended by the district attorney (Sullivan) that Rudi have a small change, that to eliminate organized crime, one must find the best man. Mason finds the best man and is faced with a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small black and white film that manages to keep the viewer's interest with its various twists, although the plot is a bit forced. It is really the story of a good man who seeks his god, justice and what he is willing to do to get it. And this is the most invented part of all. I suppose there was a time before O.J., of the Menendez brothers, etc. Etc., when people believed in justice and the integrity of lawyers. For this viewer, however, those days are long over. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job: his elegant, elegant appearance and his declamatory voice show us a confident and successful man, but also deeply attentive. Pidgeon has had a wonderful career that has lasted for 60 years, but he never grew up to the superstar. He was a solid actor, who could play and do anything. Perhaps because when he arrived at the door, he was thirty-five and lacked the idol matinee; or that particular something could be missed; or that he was beaten at the beginning as the second protagonist of a great female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. It gives an honest and touching performance here. <br /> <br /> Great movie with good performance.
