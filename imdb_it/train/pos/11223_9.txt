Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the gambling world proud. The various moves with the wrists had to be learned as the throwing of craps is a skill in and of itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I expected the "good girl" to cry over her grave instead of her Buddy. Especially with his comments on "going to the funeral of his best friend", when he first meets Matt. And then of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw the battery acid into Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (interesting role for Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood DO finals happen, but the script is so excellent, the acting so carefully made that you are blissfully unaware. <br /> <br /> And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Taking us back to the 1950s when our "native passions" were first unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a little racism that makes his ugly head in Chicago look bad, but in a club he beautifully called "Biloxi" with a Confederate flag supporting racist remarks. I'll watch it again, just to listen to music. Fortunately, I have the FACTOTUM soundtrack, so I can listen to it in the car. Look at both together and you will see how Matt matured ... interpreting the characters of the bar rooms in both. Surely he owns a bar in the Paramount HOtel in New York, he probably has great opportunities to do his studies. Great actor, just entered his. Show finely nuanced shows ... the good and the bad in his characters. His "boy out of the farm" is a large studio, made particularly touching by his dachshund eyes. Makes love convincingly. Since he has been in many movies with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder what it is like ... making love with an actress you grew up with. Adds conviction, I'll say it.
