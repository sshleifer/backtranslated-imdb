Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did, I love this show! I think it was done very well and thought. All this distinguishes it as a spin-off that is not meant to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with a bad single trying to get the better of the good guy. Using the famous Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters it's much easier to engage the viewer with parodic humor from the beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs that annoyed the fans. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts of the 80s. These spin-offs had their place: they allowed the sale of new content, created new fans and kept the Scooby-Doo merchandise on the shelves. I agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!" it doesn't fit this traditional role, but it's probably what I'd always wanted Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action-packed show that focuses on the best / funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to details, the bad guys, the "Best Friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, constant humor! Bad features: none, even if the renewed Mystery Machine is sometimes close enough. <br /> <br /> Well Done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
