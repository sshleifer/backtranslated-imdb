The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his artistic project is to unmask the ridiculous culture in which we are immersed. Of course, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. Attacks stand up comics (CAW, CAW, CAW), rock bands, models, successful Hollywood films and touches many other media. In the end, he finds himself in the viewfinder of the weapon he set in motion. The film is five years old and sounds truer every day. It's the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
