This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what the freedom of your integrity is worth ... in the most delicious and light way. Not a serious but hilarious adventure. <br /> <br /> History reflects life. We don't always get what we want right away but we find we get what we need to understand why we didn't get what we wanted ... which allowed us to get more than we thought we would get! You will get this when you see the movie. <br /> <br /> And this film really talks about finding love and knowing that it has found it and that it has totally changed life. <br /> <br /> It is one of my all-time favorites .... ..it is not easy to find but it is worth hunting ... I guarantee you will watch it more than one time!
