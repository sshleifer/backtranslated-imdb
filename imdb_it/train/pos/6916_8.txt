Winchester '73 was the film that moved Mann from b-movies to the big league, saving James Stewart's post-war career, turning him into a confrontational hero (although he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves the credit for this ). Both men would have gone to much more obscure places - Mann with the very faint Devil's Doorway, which was shelved by the MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it ?? but a film about a man who hunts his brother while the rifle of the title is delivered from person to person along the track before it ends up in one of the beloved director's mountain shootouts is still stronger meat than would be expected from the system study. Great dialogue, an impressive supporting cast ?? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson each other ?? and Mann's exceptional visual sense raises the bar with this.
