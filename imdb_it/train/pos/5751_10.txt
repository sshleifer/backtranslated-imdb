What can I say about this movie? I saw it several times since I was about 6 years old. I saw the English version and it is done very well. It is a fantastic film for all ages, but is aimed more at children. I love childish humor and appreciate it. If you haven't seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you won't be disappointed!
