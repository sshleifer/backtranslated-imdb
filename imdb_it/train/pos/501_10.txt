I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series, I say POTENTIAL ... we all know that there is a chance that they will drop the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT I HOPE NOT! For those who have not seen it ... ME IT! Without the annoying "FIRST DIRECTIVE" floating above their heads every time they meet the races it could be nice ... and Scott Bakula was without doubt a GREAT CHOICE for the Captain, and even the Vulcan Babe is hot, (Watch the scene decontamination) I gave this a full 10 ... it sweeps away ALL the other openers of the series .. I hope this goes beyond 7 years ...
