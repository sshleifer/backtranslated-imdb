The film may be a bit far, but if you love the show, that's what you expect. It's not a bad movie; actually it's pretty good. If you don't like the show, don't watch the movie. Maybe it starts a little slow maybe, but then it starts again and turns out to be pretty funny. There are also some "harrowing" scenes towards the end. After all the protagonists have crossed these barriers, come and get yourself. Jerry also thinks his show upsets people and justifies the exaltation of his show. It has a good point. We care a lot about the private details of celebrities, so why is it wrong for these people to tell their private lives even on national TV. If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we ate it. Don't we like your guests doing this just because they are poor white waste and reminds us that there is really poverty in this world and not just rich movie stars living in a world of "Leave it to Beaver"?
