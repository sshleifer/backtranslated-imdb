*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the wonderful script the film is enriched by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) marrying as soon as the bombs keep falling and Hermann is sent to the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must make do to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that turns to American soldiers and meets a black soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they start to see each other constantly. Maria feels that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she becomes very serious with Bill. But one day as they become intimate with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He is not dead and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle on Bill's head and dies. Hermann takes the blame and is sentenced in the long term to prison, so Maria tells him he will succeed in something and take him outside. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in the textile industry and uses his charm to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climb the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's lover. She tells him she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann goes out of prison but goes to Canada to try to overcome all that Mary has done since he was locked up. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything in his will and Maria buys his house. Then Hermann finally returns home to his wife and they are both ready to start their marriage even if they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both still inside. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film that it is one of those movies that can be studied and discussed at great lengths. As in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. At the beginning of the film, the tones are brown and gray to represent war-torn Germany, but when Maria starts to become a success they change into bright colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the sounds of the construction is used as the only stage design and the film remains focused on Maria's achievements. Fassbinder wanted the sounds of the reconstruction to remind us of what was happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her interpretation is the key to the success of this film. With a minor actress this would have been just another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that her interpretation elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and intelligent, but at the same time uses her beauty and her femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed or feeling guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award, but he gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard a lot about the end of the film and it has to do with whether Maria intentionally left the gas. Later in the bathroom the water is running on her wrist and she seems to be sad. This is just a guess and if you think I'm wrong please send me an e-mail. I think she was excessively excited by the fact that Hermann was at home and left him accidentally (remember he wore a dress without a reason?). Then, when the will is read to her, at that point she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without his knowledge and I think he felt that everything he had done was useless. This is the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes by mistake. But I think the reason Fassbinder has an end like this is to show that anyone who sells his soul has no commercial life. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors but he was also incredibly passionate. From his point of view, Maria cannot have both. A fascinating film.
