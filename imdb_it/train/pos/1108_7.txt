Some of Altman's recognized "masterpieces" seem sadder now. Maybe it's me. As the last reviewer, I also like this "minor" Altman (recently shown on FMC), although I don't think it aimed at a large audience. Organizational policy as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of these "docudrama" satirists are outdated, like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show, but I found a lot of fun and insightful dialogue (for example "You're really, that means you're no threat to anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I liked it. And the executions are fun, especially Cavett (like "himself"), Lauren Bacall like an old conservative figurehead, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of Parliament) as a leftist ideologue (in the opening scene talking about someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics), and Carol Burnett as a basket. Everything in the inimitable Altman style, although perhaps not exactly inimitable as usual. But rather inimitable.
