When I was an 8-year-old boy, I always watched movies and television that I didn't have to, and this was one of them. <br /> <br /> It is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it must be the funniest film I've ever seen in my life, acting is excellent, they don't make comedies like this later these days (films that are REALLY fun and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some kind of bodily fluid that vomits like Judd Apatow's delayed films played by non-funny non-actors like Seth Rogen, barf) <br /> <br /> This film is a classic with actors who can act and deserve all the praise.
