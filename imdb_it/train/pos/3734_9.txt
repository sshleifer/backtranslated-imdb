The dehumanizing effect of war is a highly studied subject in films; as well as the equally dehumanizing, but potentially life-saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard model, we see men treated as dirty but emerging as soldiers, with some mutual respect for their commanding officers, and the judgment is reserved if such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is the judgment on the merits of the war for which they are trained (typically, like here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting interpretation, centering his story on a presumptuous dissident named Bozz (interpreted extraordinarily well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power ultimately governs with consent, and lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught and compelling storyline has been built, and it is also a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, to name just another film of a similar type, lost concentration after the action moved to Asia). While this is not a disconcerting film of originality, it is extremely well done and captivating vision throughout: the best film by this director I've seen, and among the best of its kind.
