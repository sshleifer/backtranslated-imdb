It's not a bad martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without vulgar language and too much blood. The screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line for the story that works. It would be nice to see something else from her in the same genre. You like art and have strong women promenant. It was definitely worth looking at. I recommend the film to all fans of drama and martial arts.
