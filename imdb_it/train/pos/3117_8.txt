I will begin by saying that I am very happy with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, don't ruin it by doing a sequel of years from now or a prequel. Leave it. Giusto..Moving on. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it seems like he was meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne films, you will not be disappointed by the third episode. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how all the information we get in "Identity" and "Supremacy" come together in "Ultimatum" to finally paint the complete picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. Action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of your seat. The struggles between Bourne and the killers are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of the movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gets their Intel and this movie is right on that street, making it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without looking at the 2 previous installments ... you will continue to enjoy the movie, but I still suggest you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and to become attached and part of his world. This allows you to enjoy and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the top 2, but personally I think "Ultimatum" could, just MIGHT, have the advantage in comparing the trilogy.
