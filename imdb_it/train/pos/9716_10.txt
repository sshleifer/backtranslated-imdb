To appreciate this film to the full you must be a) strongly in love (without a marriage) b) recognize the English humor that concerns the admiration of gallant and witty life situations and not just corrective gags c) be smart enough, because the authors they gave an opportunity to laugh and cry every single minute of this movie, and only if you meet the "b" and "c" requirements, can you recognize and appreciate the author's input. d) to fully enjoy the film you have to love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) you have to admire creative people, a bit melancholy with extraordinary and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> if you meet all these requirements, you are likely to rate this film as close to 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed half (!) as much as looking at this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry as I laughed at certain times (I'm always sensitive, whenever good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
