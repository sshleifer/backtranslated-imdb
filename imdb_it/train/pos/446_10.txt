One of my favorite movies ever, always. Simply beautiful, full of human emotions, wit, humor, intelligence. The story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is also a fantastic ... a great selection of the best British talents around. I loved them all for each different element introduced in the film. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to form a story like this, - everything about this movie works. <br /> <br /> I like it :)
