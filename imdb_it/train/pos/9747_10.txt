I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 and I really enjoyed it. About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca), so seeing the finale of this film reminds me a lot of that great evening. What don't you like about this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looks great. The story is actually very funny in some parts and the food fight scene is still one of the most fun I've ever seen. The balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful, as was the song that sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And listen to the wonderful duet of Santa Lucia. You get real people, this was a film about an opera singer named Georgio Fini who was just played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their secondary roles. <br /> <br /> I am VERY happy to still have this VHS tape almost sold out of this movie, but I would like it to be released on DVD, especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still in today's cinema!
