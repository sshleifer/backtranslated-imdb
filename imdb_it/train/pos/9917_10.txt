This is the most faced documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centered on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings to life issues we have chosen simply to ignore. <br /> <br /> Taking no political aspect, this film is neutral, a moving image of reality that our Western societies choose not to educate us - the by-products of economic growth, the externalities paid by the citizens of less developed communities, source of our comfort and loss of our consumer lifestyles. /> <br /> Incredible, excruciating, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but it's worth it - please stop being ignorant and see at least these photographs of the truth without feeling any pressure to take a position on these issues. 10/10 definitely!
