Creative visual epic of an inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film can have neither the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting. But who dares to say that this film is not art? I'm not a supporter of the idea, that an important film must be serious, not commercial or annoy me with questions. There are also many films, especially these attributes, that I like. Bogus Journey, for sure, is not one of these films. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive charged and childish energy. This film does not reflect reality. His friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a nice combination of time-place to live in! With the exception of that music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I've always liked the photography and the scenarios in this film. Especially in this point Bogus Journey far surpasses its prequel. The effects are also good, and I think most of them are done without CGI. Generally I prefer good old effects in big budget movies. Certainly it is the 'just another Hollywood movie' from the point of view of some peoples. But I think this is in a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A brief word to the soundtrack: the whole band and orchestral music fit very well into the film. Even the sound design is not lacking. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to take this Winger track from the "station" of the scene to build the robots of the bill and the ted in the van. I love the unconventional work of the cameras at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying this: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very imaginative! It is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. It is absolutely superior to the kane, apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... No way!? Yes, how! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Who dares to disagree is guilty of "artist-like behavior" or likes Terminator Salvation (which is the biggest self-defamation) <br /> <br /> PS : part 1 is not the best film. So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! It is not!
