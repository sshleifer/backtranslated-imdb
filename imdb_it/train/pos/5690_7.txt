I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought the acting was very good, but the story on everyone left a lot to be desired. This film has the same consistency and appearance as Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this kind of lifestyle; on the belly of society, in which their total existence is based on the use of drugs, on crime, on violence, on sex and on a total lack of respect for themselves or for anyone, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is exceptional in his role as a "burned out" former porn star John Holmes. The supporting cast is just as good. However, this is a dark, dark, disquieting and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily life of these people was brutal. If you're not interested in these murders or you're a "fan" of John Holmes, this is not a movie to watch. If you want to see a docu-drama about murder, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood from the 1960s with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
