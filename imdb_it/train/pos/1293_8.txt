This is an excellent little film about the solitude of the individual man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single, but he has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he makes absolutely no effort! <br /> <br /> He has a stoicism and a fatalism that defies all hope of ever reaching the couple - his friend Jose Garcia in the role of Tisserand is in the same situation, but at least he makes a brave effort to transcend his virginity extended (she is 28 and admits she never had sex). <br /> <br /> Excellent outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen, where the two software travels for work. They try various discos and places but all needlessly. My theory is that they are trying the wrong places - they go to more or less "young" nightclubs; they should try the type that older people have, more than their age. <br /> <br /> Harel becomes more and more isolated and makes a little effort de Niro, as in Taxi Driver, prompting his friend / colleague to go and stab some guy who brought out a cute girl in the nightclub. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at.
