With a relatively small budget for an animated film of just $ 60 million, the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job. <br /> <br /> They combined cutting-edge digital animation, the talented talents of Ray Romano's voice, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) create a very fun family movie with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and care of the members of their own herd group. And sometimes many different creatures are needed to create a herd. <br /> <br /> As I watch this film I received a strong political message about how to get along with people who share your space - perhaps it should be necessary to visualize for all the leaders of the world! <br /> <br /> David Newman - yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - provides an excellent score that is not intrusive but serves to move the action along and, at times, it is positively touching. <br /> <br /> The general appearance of the film is incredible; a land of intensely colored colors, strangely believable of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. Even the individual characters were delightfully believable, with Manfred's facial expressions by Ray Romano being a special gift. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as is a DoDo is. '<br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that can alarm or scare children more or less disinfected - but still that's true. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to watch in the theater and buy at home.
