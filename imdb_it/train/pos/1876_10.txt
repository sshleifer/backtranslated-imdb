An adaptation of the book "In search of fish". This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always splendid performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This film was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time, which is why it was overlooked. I highly recommend this film to everyone, you will be fascinated by its history and will make the audience empathic with this guy who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like true inspirational stories, then look at Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thanks
