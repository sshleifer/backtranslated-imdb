William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends with their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, disturbing events happen at home, including the death of Sophie's cat. At Sophie's birthday party, a pipe leaks blood and leaves the place, revealing a secret later. <br /> <br /> "The House That Bled to Death" is a scary and one of the best episodes of the "Hammer House of Horror" series. The fantastic turning point, the revelation of a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The House That Bled to Death")
