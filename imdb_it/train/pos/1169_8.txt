An elegant, moody, innovative bloodbath based on revenge. Even cheese, of course, and sporadically much cheese. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the plot of revenge unleashed by the exact same event, and the girl comes on the side of the good guy because of the bad behavior of the bad guy. It is sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but it is so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be someone as beautiful as Alain running around with a cashmere sweater and a trench coat? And yet it is totally hard and cold. Nobody can touch it nowadays, even if someone like Jude Law could try to guess. Difficult for every girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car pursuits (and those are generally not my cup of tea) - especially one willing in the woods. People have also met their fate in a creative and bloody way, for example in a dump cruncher. But beyond the cheese, the general atmosphere was influenced and expertly pulled out. More creativity, excitement and freshness in that "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
