I was amazed by the improvements made in an animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see the details in the grass and in the surface structures. The detail, the colors and the nuances are at least one order of magnitude better than Toy Story. As they were able to pull out the shadows, I'll never know. I hope PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was produced, so I can find out how this was done. Based on this film, I think the animated films of the future will be judged based on this film.
