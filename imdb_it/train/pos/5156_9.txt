I agree with many of the negative reviews published here, for reasons that I will discuss later. But this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is as perfect as Ernst Rohm, the brutal leader of the Brownshirt. Every scene he has with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so evil that he dominates all but the crude and primitive Rohm - and clearly he digs Rohm for this very reason. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle illuminates the way Hitler appreciated Rohm's brutality, but later sacrificed him for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone plays a harrowing interpretation of Geli Raubal, Hitler's niece and victim of her unspeakable perversions. Without directly revealing sexual filth, Jena Malone stages the whole horror of the slow extinction of a young girl's spirit. Use his eyes and his voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come. And she's brilliant! Zoe Telford is very similar to Jena Malone with her portrait of Eva Braun. Eve is clearly sick, cruel and heartless, but at the same time depends almost indifferently on Adolph's twisted tenderness. The scene of the aborted love between them (which hints at the tingling of the truth of Hitler's enormous self-hatred) is both chilling and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber gives a deliciously weasel-like performance as Putzi Hanfstaengel, the spine-less man of the city who is seduced by Hitler's promises of wealth and power. While a brute like Rohm simply loves the idea of ​​crushing the skulls under his boots, Schrieber's character is one of many Germans who abhors Nazi violence but cannot resist the quick and easy way to money and power. His vainglorious fawn on Hitler soon lost him in respect of his wife, interpreted with style and sensuality by the splendid and regal Julianna Margulies. They offer a true portrait of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These performances carry on the mini series, easily overcoming the occasional weaknesses of the script. There is an exception. Unfortunately, the acting costume designers of Matthew Modine are not up to it. His noble journalist from lunk-haid spoils every scene he has: the viewer can't wait for Rohm's shirts to trample on that smug and right expression from his golden boy's face, from the ignorant and low-faced . But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the concrete inaccuracies of the script, Hitler's perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant and compelling drama. But the record on the battlefield of Corporal Hitler is severely distorted. As if he were afraid that the public could not handle the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, writers make Hitler look like a whining coward who "implored" an iron cross. As if anyone in the Kaiser's army could get a medal just by complaining! The film makes it look like Hitler was a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier. They also suggest that his companions despised him, when in reality he was widely admired by officers and men enrolled in the same way. The depressing thing is that the mini-series manages so well to represent Hitler as a monster honestly, but they failed to resist the shot. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, Hitler: RISE OF EVIL is an ascending success highlighted by powerful performances.
