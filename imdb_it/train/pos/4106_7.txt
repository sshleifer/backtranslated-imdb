This is definitely NOT the intellectual movie with a deep mission, so I don't really think there is too much to not understand if you are not Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, rather amusing and sometimes, perhaps, not very pathetic. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý) so the authors are. But it doesn't matter, the genre is very different and these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to teach you a lesson, she will try to make you laugh and there are some possibilities she will succeed. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not brilliant, but I liked it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
