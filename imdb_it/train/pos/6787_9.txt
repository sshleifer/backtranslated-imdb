I ran into MTC last night. <br /> <br /> I hadn't seen it since it was originally released, but I had never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> I had completely forgotten how beautiful he was and the talented Signe Hasso was when he was still young, ditto for Shelly Winters before he came out of the abyss. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman, however, was the quintessential state actor of his time - I had read Otello in high school English - and hated him After seeing "A Double Life" I read it again and finally I understood what it was. <br /> <br /> Gordon / Kanin's writing team was at their best when this script was written - <br /> <br /> A film worth remembering and reviewing,
