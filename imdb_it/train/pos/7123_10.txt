Do I sometimes watch a movie and I'm really impressed? and yet it is not easy to explain why I liked it so much. Is this mainly true for uncommon films? those that can hardly be compared to the rest out there. Good night, Mr. Tom is one of these special films. Is there a lot of emotion in that movie ?? and the acting was so beautiful that as I watched the movie, I cried and laughed as the story went on. The young Nick Robinson ?? is a young boy (William) evacuated from London due to air strikes there during World War II. Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man who leaves the village to which the evacuated children have been sent. <br /> <br /> At the beginning Tom refuses to take any responsibility - how to take care of a young boy in need ?? but accept because it is left without choice. During your stay, does Mr. Tom discover how horrible life is for William? next to his luggage, did his mother send a belt and written instructions for his son's guest ?? don't hesitate to use it. This belt is considered in the field ?? never be used so brutally. Mr. Tom provides a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. All of a sudden a letter that William is called home in London with a letter that says he doesn't feel well ?? and start all over again ?? only this time it gets much worse ?? Are there many feelings you can feel in this movie ?? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema comparable only to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if one is to be compared. I really enjoyed watching it and I highly recommend it. Before concluding this review I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange as Zac ?? reminded me of a friend of mine from my childhood (:
