This is surprisingly an above average slasher, it's fun and well done, with some good blood! All the characters are decent, and the story is pretty funny, plus Molly Ringwald played the whore extremely irritating. I bought it at a pawn shop for $ 1, and it was worth it, and the special effects were damn good for the budget, I also loved the mask the killer wore because it was actually a little creepy . The ending was really nice, because I loved the way they defeated the killer, and the predictable ending was also a lot of fun, plus all the characters, except for Ringwald, were surprisingly nice enough! It's decently created and written, and I thought it was quite creative and original, sometimes pure, and some scenes of death were really impressive. This killer didn't screw up, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really appreciate this movie, plus the opening was really bad, with them filming the movie! This is a surprisingly above average slasher, it's fun and well done, with a bit of good blood, and I say it's worth watching! The management is good. Kimble Rendall does good! work here with the solid work of the camera, using a disturbing setting, good angles and keeping the film at a rapid pace. The acting is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the bitch very well, and I had problems sorry for her, after all she should have been the heroine, it went better towards the end, but not by much, I am surprised that she decided to make this film, however she did a great job! Frank Roberts is as fantastic as the killer, he is threatening, disturbing and has a hellish mask, and this guy wasn't messing around, he was great! Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and is as good as the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall worth watching! *** out of 5
