This film contains one of the greatest interpretations of Richard Dreyfuss, as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his mother does not detect the impostor. Moreover, this film is fun, but it also has a serious side. What is particularly intriguing in this film is the character of Madonna, who is the dictator's lover, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. The evolution of Madonna from lover to political leader has greatly improved the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film is an actor in difficulty and a little buffoon, evolves and at the end of the film commands respect. I liked this movie.
