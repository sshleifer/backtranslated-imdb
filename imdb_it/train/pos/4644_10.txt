Show the funniest parody of pretentious auteur films ever made. <br /> <br /> This movie shows all the clich√©s, and then some! Atrociously bad actors (Down syndrome!). Terribly heavy self-important dialogue. Scenes that should shock but fall flat. Edit Jarring. Useless plot points. All enclosed in a kind of immeasurable miasma of lack of respect for the public and a vague sense of guilt. <br /> <br /> Achieves exactly what it was designed for. A hilarious irony of those boring movies made by spoiled and teen donors, to show their parents when they ask them what they have been doing for the past two years! After "What is it?" received his award at Cannes, it was said that the presenter Werner Herzog had been informed that the film was actually a parody, in part of his films! The information was apparently blown up. Until today he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> However, seeing it and laughing, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.
