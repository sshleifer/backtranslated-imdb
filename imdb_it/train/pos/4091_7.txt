I saw this film in a London cinema in 1975 and haven't seen it since. I found it funny. I loved it is originality. It is rare for someone to make a film like this - and it is also sad. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that once I read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a fan of the film, I always "photos" books as movies. A little "fits" them, you know? But as I read it, I thought, well, it would have been a great movie - but obviously it should have been "adapted" - to the point where it would have brought fewer relationships with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well WHY? Of course, it could never be shown on TV on Sunday afternoon, but on condition that it was shown in the cinemas to ADULTS, who knows what it contained, where is the PAIN? Damn, my civil liberties have been crushed here. A director MUST be able to make a literal adaptation of the movie "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult film censorship should NOT EXIST. But sadly, while I accept that with INTELLIGENT adults, this freedom can be harmless, there would always be those who would not have the rationality to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and who could be encouraged to commit wrong actions. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into that category. <br /> <br /> During his appearance in England, the British censor rejected him. Despite the relaxation of '69 on nudity, given the theoretical theme of the film's bestiality, if the censor had ANY time, he would have sought a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days, there was an alternative. The G.L.C. It was a local municipal council with a department that had the power to pass a film only for London, where it was believed that the public was more "dormant" than those who lived in wands. <br /> <br /> The film was duly presented and PAST. However, it later emerged that the "council" consisted of only four people - three who voted, plus a "president." And that day, one of the voters was sick. So the remaining two voters and the president sat down to see "La Bete". One of those voters thought, like me, that the film was hilarious and hardly encouraged any wrongdoing on the part of SOMEONE. The other lacked imagination and simply thought that the piece was disgusting. And the president didn't understand him, so he decided to make mistakes on the side of LIBERTA. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also thought it was disgusting, but it was TOO LATE! The film had received its "X-London" certificate and was open to a mixed reaction. The G.L.C. Shortly afterwards the committee for film censorship was dissolved! Thus "La Bete" was opened in London only by what could be called a FLUKE! But I'm glad it was. It's great! If you haven't seen it, do it. It is a FANTASY, and as such it is much less disturbing than most of the things you see in the news these days ...
