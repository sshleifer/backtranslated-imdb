Following my experience in Finland for just over a week, I would say that this film very accurately describes the nature of Finnish society. Especially the phenomenon of young couples with a child who has serious problems is very familiar to me, since I saw the exact same person when I was in Finland. The relationships and problems of people, the fragility of the institution of marriage, the culture of drinking, unemployment and the problem of rising money, are all very well set, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to understand and bind to each other, but the joint picture is still rewarding. Not each of the short stories is exciting or profound, but as mentioned above, the general picture does not fail to convey the feeling of "real life" and fascinates the viewer. I happen to think in a moment of calm: what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, that's what's happening. Movies like this are good for feeding your imaginative power. It would be prudent to assume that this film can apply to life in many countries, but it especially reflects Finland as it is, and damn well. <br /> <br /> A comment on acting: being the fan of the Finn I am the cinema, I have never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I found the acting in this feature right next to perfection overall . Perhaps not a masterpiece, but an excellent attempt by the entire crew. I'll keep an eye on the future versions of the director and the cast .. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
