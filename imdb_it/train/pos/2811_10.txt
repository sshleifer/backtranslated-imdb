Silverlake Life, The view from here, is an absolutely amazing film about AIDS and a gay love relationship. Some images are really hard to take, especially when you are gay or are afraid of AIDS, and probably for every sensitive person who looks at it. It is not easy to make a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences not only on one, but on the lives of two people. This film teaches how to take care of each other in these difficult times, but it never becomes too morbid, it still shows life at any time, reminding you that outside the theater or your room, life goes on, whatever both the fate of some people could be The characters are incredibly captivating, while we observe their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit, never revealing anything too private or offensive. Children should certainly not watch this film, but adults, whether faced with such situations or not, should do so, and will not regret the tears they have shed.
