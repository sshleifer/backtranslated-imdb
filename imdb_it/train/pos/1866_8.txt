A great story, based on a true story of a young black man and all the difficulties along the way. Being that this is the first Denzel Washington movie that he himself would direct, I must admit that I was a little skeptical, but who wouldn't ...? But then again, he is a great actor with many years of experience and the end result went very well. The story is told in a fantastic way, making you the one who had difficulties during your childhood, and your adult age, see yourself in those situations. So, it hits you hard, letting you know that you're not the only one going through hell. In all, a moving story of a young man trying to make it in this fucking world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the writer of this film) Strongly recommended. 8/10
