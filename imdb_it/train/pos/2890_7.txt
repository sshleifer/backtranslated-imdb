The twelfth Disney animated film is a reasonable film told through a simple story. Although a little dated, it deserves a place on the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> It is not among the best works of Disney, but it is satisfying. One of Disney's most "simple" works, yes, but it retains a certain magic and enchantment (which old Disney is well known for). This was an important film because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this were a failure, there would be no more Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is somehow like a return to Disney's first animated film ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") because it shows the genre of fairy tales. It is not clear where the story takes place, but I suppose it is somewhere in France because it is based on a story by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many nice characters, such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy Godmother (for a fairy is certainly fun), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very intelligent and fun. I love his voice. It really has that similar quality to the mouse. Gus may not be so smart, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> The king is hilarious, but I think what makes him so funny is his temper. The Grand Duke is a very nice and even funny guy. They are two of my favorite characters in this film and are responsible for many of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is certainly one of the most fascinating of Disney. There is no doubt that Prince Philip of "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince, because he looks very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) should not be sympathetic because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is kind, gentle, pretty and adorable. By the way, I think his beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously mischievous. The way he walks, raising his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobby facial expressions make it fun. Ironically, it is very similar to the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitude towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is an evil and evil cat. Yet there is nothing annoying to him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, even if it is not among the best of Disney. The best song of this film is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many well-known talented voice actors in this such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. <br /> <br /> Despite being simple in appearance, the film has good graphics, as well as its details, although never something "out of the world". However, the king's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.
