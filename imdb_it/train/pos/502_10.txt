Ok, this has been coming for a few weeks, but it's here. Mainly, this is due to claims of various negative natures. Starting from technology. When Star Trek: TOS worked, the special effects technology was extremely low technically, and in addition, the crew had little money to make any kind of fake mock up. In the 35 years of the TOS series, the Star Trek crew has become an expert in economics. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, they decided, rightly in my mind, to abandon the aspect of TOS and reverse engineering of TNG et all. What would happen if they decided not to make the transporter without golden glitter or to make the phase guns appear closer to those of Star Trek II? Regarding the fact that the nits were chosen for the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed based on comments made by Kirk and Riker that the Earth only met the Klingons in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> The company offers us the most promising exploration site we've seen in a while. This is what Voyager may have been. No series can evolve without some inconsistencies, but be grateful that Star Trek has so few. So stop grabbing and having fun.
