I grew up in the south of West Virginia; I'm about the same age as (or maybe a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", the book that forms the basis of the true story of this heart-warming film. <br /> <br /> And so I refer strictly to the theme of the West Virginia coal mine, and to the extraordinary effect that Sputnik had at that time (4 October 1957) on all of us. The Rocket Boys have continued to make great lives for themselves. I continued my studies in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik woke up many young people at the US "Science Gap" in the United States in those days of the Cold War ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will be the heart of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: take it; Watch it; recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
