It is a theatrical game, adapted to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the splendid home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a fabulous Broadway play, but his last 4 attempts failed - horribly. <br /> <br /> An aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a Sydney theater writing seminar, sent him a copy of the game he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon) that the play is fabulous: a fiery success. But is it good enough to die? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> Intelligent dialogue and numerous plot twists keep this movie entertaining from beginning to end. The whole cast seems to have fun. Remember another fun mystery of Michael Caine: Sleuth. Worth watching. <br /> <br />
