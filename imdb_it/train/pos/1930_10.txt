This film is hilarious, original and well directed. I became a BIG BAD SWIM groupie, monitoring it for film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I've seen it about half a dozen times, and each time, the enthusiastic response of the audience has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films released over the years. At almost every festival it was screened, sold out or won the Audience Favorite award. It is clear that people love this film, and even more clearly the reason why it does. The cinematography is superb, the characterization and brilliant acting, the fantastic ending, and the compassionate direction, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It is hard to believe that this is Ishai Setton's first film. I hope he will be released soon so that everyone can see it.
