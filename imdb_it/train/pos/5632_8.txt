Revisitation of the drama, scripted by William Mastrosimone based on his theatrical performance, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in his car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to escape but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do. He realizes, however, that Joe has taken his wallet and knows where he lives. When her roommates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are out at work, Joe visits her to finish what she started. After Joe has humiliated and degraded her in a variety of ways, she has the opportunity to counterattack and imprison him. Knowing well she is in another situation "her word against yours" and technically no rape took place, she has no intention of taking it easy until she confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions are. <br /> <br /> After all, the film amounts to a showdown between its two adversaries. As he continues, Marjorie shows such ruthlessness that one must wonder whether she has become as upset as her nemesis. Fawcett does a fairly lucrative job, while Russo is really as excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on the screen for most of the running time, the film has an intimate nature that suggests it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young does not avoid the ugliest and most exploitative elements of the situation; sometimes the film becomes uncomfortable to watch. And when Marjorie gets the upper hand, things change enough so it's not so easy to encourage her to look for blood, and hopefully Pat can show her the reason. <br /> <br /> "The ends", I felt, was a pretty good film that at least kept interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both in favor (Scarwid has a great time when Terry turns out to be a rape victim), and the pace is consistent. Of course, dialogue is not always very clear, but the material is convincing at every stage of the journey. <br /> <br /> 8/10
