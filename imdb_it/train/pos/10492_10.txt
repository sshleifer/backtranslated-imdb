I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex but does not detract from the entertainment. It is a chuck full of comic moments and has a very captivating quality. The characters are what make the movie so beautiful. Each of them has their own eccentric qualities that add to humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law come to mind. Superb acting was done by everyone, particularly Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson have been great together in bringing out some of the funniest moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
