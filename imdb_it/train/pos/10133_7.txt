Why did it look like her husband kept calling her Appy? He ruined a great episode so I can give him a 6. Good grammar and pronunciation are essential for a film. <br /> <br /> It was very Hellraiser, with all the skin ripping even if I don't know how someone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ for the body the biggest organ in reality and without us . The more a horror movie is true, the more it is disturbing and more fun. <br /> <br /> I admit though that the stories of the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 as on Yankies, your English is at par!
