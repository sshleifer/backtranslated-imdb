I came across this movie by accident when I listed all the movies I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on vacation and I'm so happy to have included it. It's about the problems that most directors avoid, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for TV, so I couldn't buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It is a touching story about how people with eating disorders do not necessarily avoid everyone and those who actually have diet companions. It brought to mind that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious health consequences than many people ignore.
