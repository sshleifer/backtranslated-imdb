{Possible spoilers coming ... you've been warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and cinematic musicals of all time! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes the luster (not to mention the songs) of a show gets lost in its transition from the stadium to the screen. This is, for the most part, definitely not the case here. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors "bounce the ball" (ie, have unbeatable chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owner of the oldest permanent floating game established in New York, and the most famous gambler who even bets on the smallest things - like his fever that goes up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin. Jean Simmons, sweet and fresh, is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it's true, her rods aren't as exceptional as those of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the mission doll with a heart of gold and a push to heal everything. And last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine, who takes over the role of Broadway as Miss Adelaide - the Hot Box singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14-year engagement with Nathan and get rid of the psychosomatic cold that was given to her. <br /> <br /> First of all, congratulations to Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley as they resume their roles on Broadway as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two more amiable players than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is superb, as usual, and even if he doesn't have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget ... as he has this sense of determination to bring everything possible to his role of Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" makes me shudder every time I see him execute the number. It is particularly pleasant to hear him say "Dad ... I have cider in my ears". <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to his appearance, his voice and the way he behaves. Pray so much for her not only to win Sky (or, in the end, believe him), but to help people get over their gambling, drinking and other sins and living a life with God. His interpretation of " If I Were A Bell "is splendid, to say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He's so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from the Broadway cast never could (terrifying actor, but the guy was deaf-mute ... go figure). I really liked the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... I would like a boy to sing like that to ME. Frankie's casual attitude goes beyond the boundaries of this film. But above all, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is simply pure perfection in this role. From the accent to its "Adelaide's Lament" alert, it's simply fantastic. And it's also my favorite part of the whole movie. It really makes you feel for Adelaide ... especially when it cries first and then again during "Sue Me". I haven't decided yet if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... maybe I like them the same way. Either way, it's great with those and "Take Back Your Mink". (I'm sad that they omitted "hollanderize" from the movie ...) It's absolutely WONDERFUL, not to say hilarious, and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this film is their jargon. It is a mixture of high class and street slang. They never use "IS", "I" or "That is". It is always "IS", "I want" and "That is". Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals of all time, and it's one of those that you should have time to watch every time you turn it on. My only complaint? No "Marry The Man Today". Now it's a beautiful song.
