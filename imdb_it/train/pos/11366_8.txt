A superb and compelling drama about hunting the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Magnificent interpretation of Stephen Rea as a forensic scientist in charge of the investigation, which finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old members of the communist party who want to keep a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has a basic theme on the decline of communist society, and the progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected in the progress in social and political change in Russia, which is being subtly put. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two points of view of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and by Rea himself. These are first polarized, with Sutherland "high" in the system that looks down, and Rhea "low" on the ground, looking up. However, do they have a common cause ?? to capture the serial killer. <br /> <br /> During the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually fades until at the end of the film Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland respect each other, the murderer is captured and Glasnost symbolically arrives . Excellent script. <br /> <br /> Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is superb and comprehensive, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is absolutely convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation for helping.
