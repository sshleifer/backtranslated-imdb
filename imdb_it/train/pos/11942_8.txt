At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how stubborn he was while looking for a scoop. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of the London tarot serial killer. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the middle of a magic show by the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid into his investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is the murderer. However, he falls in love with him and asks if Joe Strombel is in his scoop. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another Woody Allen comedy out of Manhattan, back in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed very inclusive with his destiny as a hero in a country where people drive "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in great shape as a comedian. However, his current muse, Scarlett Johansson, of which I am a big fan, has an excessive acting and is annoying in many moments, changing his accent in a histrionic pronunciation. His character is absolutely stupid and promiscuous, and I was rather disappointed with his performance (probably for the first time in his filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
