Shamefully, before seeing this film, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to make sure that he was not afflicted, like his character, with (good?), what was afflicted. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. He pulled it impeccably. Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final desires and needs of a unique young woman could be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can be, when the right artists present them the right way, like they did in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention Miss Carter's dynamic beauty in this film. I have often said that it was the most beautiful creature to have ever honored the face of our land, but it seemed to have vented itself in this particular film. <br /> <br /> I hope that anyone of you watching this movie enjoyed as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
