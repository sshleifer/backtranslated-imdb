This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it's a pretty impressive job. Because it is not in print it is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and tandem animation. This worked as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed for some time. * sigh * More recommended.
