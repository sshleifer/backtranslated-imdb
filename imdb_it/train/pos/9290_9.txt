This is not the kind of film for which John Wayne is known. He plays a diplomat, a man who does things with words and persuasion rather than with physical action. The film moves with quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story. <br /> <br /> For the open mind, the patient and the thoughtful, this film is a rich description of an intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are two intertwined stories. The great story is of an internalized, isolationist and externalized Japan, expansionist America clashes when their interests conflict. The small, human, story is of a barbarian stranger (Wayne) and the initial hostility and antipathy of a civilized Geisha who turn to mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the greater history of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done and all the actors play their roles well. The two main roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris, striking exactly the right mix of strength and negotiation in his dealings with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is equally as excellent as the title Geisha, charming and delicious. The interaction between his character and John Wayne is particularly well represented. This is exactly how these two individuals (as depicted in the film) would behave. <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. All pomposity is missing. and is a realistic representation of how the events depicted may have occurred. The characters are real people, not knowingly "big" characters in the story. Furthermore, the clash of cultures and interests is represented with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the clash between a traditionally powerful and isolationist traditionalist, Japan and an emerging new-power nation from the other side of the ocean is very well summarized in an exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan, and that passing ships cannot even enter the port for water. The baron replies that Japan just wants to be left in peace. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international transport and that if things continue as before, the nation will be considered nothing more than a band of brigands who infest an important road. A real summary of the way in which the two countries considered themselves both in the right position and saw the other in the wrong. The resulting clash between two hypercritical peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history, a continuous theme that echoes in the present and in the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and representation of the mid-nineteenth century in Japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialization that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual surprise and an illuminating intuition of ancient Japanese civilization. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone, whether it's a John Wayne fan or not, to watch this movie if they get the chance. Just be aware that it's not an action movie. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a low-boiling love story that (to their surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film in its merits, without preconceptions, let it immerse you in its history, and you'll like it a lot. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent film.
