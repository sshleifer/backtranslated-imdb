This is one of the most overlooked gems that Hollywood has ever produced. - A young British WWII fighter whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that he will be dead within minutes. For some reason the man who should certainly be dead moves away from the wreck and eventually finds out that he was destined to report to the sky. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and asks to have his "day in court" to discuss his case. The man claims that his situation had changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he had fallen in love and therefore had become a different person, one who deserved the chance to live. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is a cinematic delight! "The announcement of the jury of equals" is a highlight. The story, however fantastic, is addictive and will leave you spellbound for almost 2 hours of play. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This film is in my top 10 favorite of all time, it has my highest recommendation!
