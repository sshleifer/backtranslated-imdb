Both visually and musically beautiful. A feast for the eye and the ear. The typically Victorian element of the opening sequences was absolutely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would have been rightly proud of. Technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are imagined and creatively realized in a traditional stage. The dance of many of the major artists is incredibly good. Photography and lighting are first class and sound recording is admirably combined with the high general level of technical skills employed. A great film for the whole family at Christmas time and a delightful discovery that will resist more visions.
