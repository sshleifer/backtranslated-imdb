The best martial arts film ever made. This film is better than anything Bruce Lee has ever done. A classic with an extremely fun and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the real king of kung fu. It's a pity that, although Bruce Lee had been so overrated, Jackie Chan took an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
