Except for an embarrassing scene, this refreshing fairytale fantasy has a fun and delicious background of cynical spirit for adults that fascinates the audience and a soundtrack that energetically moves this epic fairy tale. Except for one of Robert DeNiro's scenes that doesn't look smooth and looks out of sync with the rest of the film, this sensual romantic fairy tail has a great narrative feel and strong magic and the delicate balance between serious and adventure and lighter spiritual humor are well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight stars out of ten.
