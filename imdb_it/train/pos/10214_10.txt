For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies without any idea what will happen, so I think many of the other reviews of this movie contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again, and I have to reiterate that it has the best ending for any movie. Never. Never. Never. The true translation, "The beat of the butterfly's wings", is strangely not used as a translated title. I suppose they thought that most Americans wouldn't know what chaos theory is (except for those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on the theory of chaos and on how a small event can influence the result of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead to an event. The film is a vortex of wonderful causes and effects, while we follow the chain of chaos while intertwining different characters (about 20?). In a sense, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think of yourself, "what else had to be said"? It is at the same time a very brave ending. Too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this, but an ending like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
