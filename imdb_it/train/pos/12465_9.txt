I highly recommend reading the book before watching the film. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very compelling read (unplanned pun). It's not too difficult to read for those out there who don't read often, so don't be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion of relationships more than the film and the film will make more sense after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne, I could really relate to this book and this movie. Very few Australian writers were around the 70s, so very little is documented about a woman's way of life in an urban city in Australia during this era or class. It is a precious piece of Melbourne's history. It is a pity that it is documented as a kind of soft 80s porn movie. It is far from that and as the other review mentioned please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent at all what the film is about. Those who rent the film based on this description will only be disappointed. Remember that this film was made in 1982, so don't expect the Hollywood drama that they seem to incorporate these days. This is what I like. It's also nice to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she's just as fantastic as Nora and it's good to see her really acting, because if you're close to my age you'll remember her better for her stints in Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid this talent? This film will give you an entirely new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
