I watched this movie once and could watch it again, but even though Jamie Foxx is good at the film, I feel they could have used a "less fun" character like Alvin Sanders. The Foxx scenes, for example in the jail when faced by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too funny. David Morse is again a wonderful portraitist of a policeman. Its difficult but mostly quiet features are perfect for its role. Once again Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends up going down hard on Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in every movie. Personally I love that quality in a film, in which the actors end up in the same situation as a previous film, as these two did in The Green Mile. Overall it was a pretty good movie.
