Soap Opera speaks of a married town (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as a protagonist in her local theater, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag and a womanizer to boot, arrives in the city she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving his advice to the celebrity - he pretends that his valet is the her "manager" who deceives her believing she has everything she needs but "to experiment" to become a big star. Her husband discovers and beats the boy causing the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life sentence for her husband. The next thing you know is that she joined a traveling show of Burlesque in the hope that one day she can get to Broadway and earn enough to get her man's freedom - while her baby is sleeping in a trunk! <br /> <br /> This film has a rather interesting plot, well, maybe a bit far-fetched, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you understood it) - everything * noticeably * enhanced by strong emotional performance by Kay Francis - she just does this movie. Also here helps the well-performed acting of Minna Gombell in her role as "old forty year old lady" who works with burlesque and befriends Kay. Worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans.
