I'm a Kung Fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies full of exaggerated firearms. Now, martial arts; *That's beautiful! And John Woo surprised me by producing a very funny kung fu movie, which almost * fights * too much, if such a thing is possible! This is good stuff. <br /> <br /> Many combat scenes are very good (and some are less good), and the main characters are fun and funny. Bad guys are a bit too incredibly bad, but still fun. You must see the Sleeper Wizard !! He can only fight when he sleeps - he is hysterical! <br /> <br /> On repeated visions, however, Last Hurray For Chivalry may tend to be a bit boring and verbose, especially since many of the combat scenes are actually not so good. So, I consider "only" a 7 out of 10. But actually it's almost an "8". <br /> <br /> All in all one of the best kung fu films, made splash in the heart of the first kung fu movie. All the really good kung fu movies go from the middle to the late 70s, with some notable exceptions from the late 1960s and early 1970s (and in the early 1980s, to be honest) .
