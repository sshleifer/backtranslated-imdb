Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can do the math: 18 segments in 120 minutes means that every director has seven minutes to tell his story. The film is based on the premise that you can actually tell a story in such a short time. The premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost all the directors draw exceptional performances from a cast of great and grandiose actors. <br /> <br /> There have been so many powerful portraits in this movie that it's hard to pick one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable thing for me was Juliette Binoche as a grieving mother in the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a waitress in the "Loin du 16ème" segment and Margo Martindale as a Colorado courier who learned to speak French to visit Paris ("14ème Arrondissement" segment). <br /> <br /> A special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably the meanest boy who has ever pestered an American tourist in a Parisian subway station ("Tuileries" segment). <br /> <br /> an exceptional film. My wife and I have decided to rent it in a few months, so that we can pick out some of the delicate points that we have surely lost. However, Paris is photographed so beautifully that I suggest you try to see it on a big screen. In any case, don't miss it!
