Albeniz's music pervades this film. Once in a while it is played with the original instrumentation (for example the piano, but never a complete orchestra), but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles (for example technical) and treatments (for example jazz piano). Only occasionally is music the only goal of the film: most of the time the music is set to various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I would say that there are 12 ?? 14 scenes, which are not joined by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the heights of a single spectator. In my case, about half of them reached a peak, even if all the others were in their own way very well. Those that worked for me moved me for the aesthetic pleasure of goose meat; indeed, the final scene left me crying with joy. And somehow very magical takes you deep into Spanish culture. If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The film is practically speechless, although each scene bears the title of an Albeniz piece. Seeing this beautiful film refines my complaint that virtually none of Saura's films are available on DVD in the United States. I am thinking in particular of the flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular work of art that is available in Europe but not here (European DVDs cannot be played on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
