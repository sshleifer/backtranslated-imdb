I'm 14, so you'd probably think I never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. Boy are you wrong. I had heard that George Burns was in this film and that he won an Academy Award for it. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and I loved it. That too was fantastic. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau (this is the first time I've seen him act). And even though they had really small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That particular that they were shooting would have been fantastic if it had really been done. Let me tell you, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
