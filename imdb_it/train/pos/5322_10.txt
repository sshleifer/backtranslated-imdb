A real dark black film and a very graphic film, a beautiful plot of a man who pursues redemption, who could have left everything too late. Visually there are some really beautiful artistically surprising scenes about what can be done with a minimum budget. Full marks to Gareth Maxwell Roberts and team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although hopefully more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray looked lovely not having seen her before and I hope to see her again in the future. Subject to all interesting Sex, Drugs and Violence. Take it. I would definitely say to rent this and check if you're in the mood for a semi-moody noir.
