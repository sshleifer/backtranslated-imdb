My roommate ordered this off the web a while ago and I finally managed to watch it. It's lousy. It's cheezy. It's pretty stupid ... but it's also a lot of fun. I mean, this was the most fun we've had watching a movie like this from "City Of The Walking Dead" years ago. It was like being back at the old Drive-In Theater! It could be said that the guy who made this film loved all the horrible zombie movies dubbed. This has all the clich√©s and tricks of those movies in one, and it's clean because it's SUPPORT being that way. The cheeze factor is high, the blood flowing and the laughter rolling! The effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the boy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart pushed through his chest, both being excellent! The acting goes from terrible to really rather good. There's not a lot of plot, just a lot of blood. This is modeled on the zombie films from Italy and Spain, I think, because they linger forever on the gross scenes, like this film. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-class stuff, then you can't go wrong watching this. A nice way to waste a Friday night!
