Wow ... I don't know what to say. I just saw Seven Pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is very much in tune with the vast range of human emotions. This film was cleverly and well done. It is rare to find such intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" regarding the show of lights and shadows in such a crude way. Surely you stay attached for a long time and it gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this. Not usually one for a "bad ending", but rather a seeker of truth that embraces emotion, raw life and something more than superficiality that exists in abundance all around. So I don't mind a little pain at the end. It is true for life that there are not always happy endings. Sometimes it's not really the happy ending that you think it should be. Many people were able to live happy lives even if love and life were lost. If you are a person who seems a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
