<br /> <br /> Filmed immediately after the war, this story was created to highlight the Anglo-American relations after the war. He ended up receiving the honor of being the first Royal Premiere after World War II. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly the film brings together the Royal Air Force, the psychology of Sigmund Freud, the founding fathers of America and various others on the long stairs (special effects in his childhood) and beyond the heavenly doors without losing any of its integrity. <br /> <br /> Even if it seems absurd, this intelligent script leads and dances the spectator between heaven and earth with the ability of a mountain goat and presents a fascinating facility rarely matched in the cinema since. <br /> <br /> Prepare to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey acts like a possessed man to steal the show !!!! <br /> <br /> British cinema should cry when it remembers how beautiful it was in those early post-war years. <br /> <br />
