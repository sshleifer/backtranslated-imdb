I saw this jewel of a film in Cannes, where it was part of the directors two weeks. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun in everything, with all the members of a strong cast playing their socks. It's a comedy sometimes laughing out loud on a petty crook (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who is caught trying to steal a car and send him to prison. While in prison he meets a "lifer" who tells him about "the ultimate bellini" ?? which to you and me ?? it's a foolproof system to get rich fast. It turns out that there is a transition from a deserted building to the city jewelry store ?? which could net millions. Sounds simple? ?? throw all kinds of wacky characters and accidents along the way and you have the ingredients for a wild ride !! ?? the word passes from a low life loser to the next and soon a team is gathered to try to cash Cosimos "bellini" of the failed boxer Pero (superbly played by Sam Rockwell, definitely a star in the making) and reluctant swindler Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to take his baby with him while his wife was locked up for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also inspired a film similar to "Collinwood" ?? `Palookaville '. This makes the points of this last effort beat and although it is written and directed by the Russo brothers, it certainly has nuances about the Coen Brothers. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but hilarious part like a crippled puzzle.
