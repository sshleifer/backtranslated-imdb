As in Paradise {SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> This was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that revisits the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a top talented musician, who is physically and mentally tired of his career and has to give up. When he joins a church choir as a singer, he provokes a transformation in the life of the choristers, just as Jesus did to the society in Palestine in the first century. They laugh, they start talking openly and sincerely with each other, their faults are exposed, they are accepted, they love each other, they become a vital community. They include the mentally disabled youth (? Tore), such is their inclusiveness. <br /> <br /> The parish priest, Stig enjoyed authority by imposing a stifling morality to the congregation, and this is gradually rejected by the choristers. When Stig rejects Daniel, there is a revolt, and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of the time of Jesus, whose insistence on obedience to Jewish law, provided a stark contrast to the new life of "the golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone declares "the church invented sin". Throughout the film there is this contrast between morality and life (being). True to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Conny, when he beats him, he lets him drown in the river. The next scene, we can't believe it when the body of Daniel (risen!) Is dragged to his room (the tomb) wrapped in a sheet of white linen (the shroud!), By three women (three women keep watch at the foot of the cross in gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel is attracted to Lena, a hot and beautiful young woman who was betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous (Jesus developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene-Lena- who was probably a high-class courtesan / prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he has always wanted, and now finds satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, is all based on living a full life, in contrast to moral correctness which leads to worry about sin and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the choir all singing / humming in harmony, like a mantra, attracting the broad audience, exemplifying the harmony and interconnection that is our true human destiny.
