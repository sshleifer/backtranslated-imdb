Excellent show Instead of looking at the same old series of sitcoms, it shows where the same old thing is, just different "stars", this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining vision of office situations. We have been away from watching television for 2 years and after the return of all the available shows, we look forward to seeing this show on W. Shame on Global to pull the plug on this one. I thought this would be a winner. We are realistic about things, a few Canadian shows do it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I think it was foolish for Global to leave. I imagine they want to continue with the typical US numbness shows instead of pulling behind a Canadian show that has many promises. Don't get me wrong, I like many TV shows, but, come on people, we'll keep the variety. This unique show provided a very comical view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters not seen in any of the sitcoms today or in the past. Too bad the global has had to say no to this stupid mistake.
