Bugs life is a good movie. But for me, it's actually not comparable to movies like Toy's story and stuff like that. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as Toy's story. The film has the images, the laughter and others that Toy's story has had. But the film didn't feel enough ... I don't know, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> A life of insects ... I don't want to say it, it's a film I don't remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I haven't seen Toy's story in years, but I still remember it. I shouldn't have reviewed this film, but I am. I'm giving it a thumbs up, though it's not exactly the best job that Pixar did. <br /> <br /> The life of an insect: *** / ****
