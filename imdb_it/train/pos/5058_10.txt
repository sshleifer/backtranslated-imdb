There should be more films about our Native Americans. I think above all that using real Native Americans would be the right thing. I know that this Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job of portraying that character, since he was an Englishman. But my suggestion in Hollywood is to put more American Indians in the roles and never use anyone else. The Sioux nation has been forgotten for too long. Their poverty is a disgrace for our country. I firmly believe that our country should return the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we do not strive to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
