Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. This crosses that border with flying colors. Just a remake, I don't think so! I saw him theatrically at the age of nine, and he was completely ecstatic and entranced by the film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly invites comparisons with its 1963 counterpart. The previous film is also a fun and entertaining film, but admits that it looks more like a documentary about nature than a film. This update is more epic and cinematic. Anyway, I highly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely a must for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sour, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young American fun-loving Bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly expressed respectively by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> There is practically nothing offensive in the film. There is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No harsh violence, except for some tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall, an angry porcupine and a dark railroad pit. <br /> <br /> Exhilarating, scary, moving and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film has not won any awards, not one. Nevertheless, I will have to say that this is just as good as some of the best photo candidates today.
