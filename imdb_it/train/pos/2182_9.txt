This superb film attracts a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form: Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at ease in the story that apparently was provided by Billy Wilder. One would like to know more about what was needed, because it is an exceptionally intelligent variant of the sterile story of master / fertile - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry, run by parched numkulls, but transformed into a vibrant world of art and game of an exploited subclass of nobles and non-WASP. Looking at the last six decades of music, TV and movies in the United States, it's hard not to see the profound insights of this film as prophetic.
