I lived in those moments and I think the program has caught the heart of the era. I think he should have taken more care of the African American issue, but I think it covers a lot in the program. It was scary to sit down and watch TV riots hoping they wouldn't go far to your families and they wouldn't be burned. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job playing a veterinarian returning from the war. I went to school with guys who came back. Some had changed more than others and others not so much. It annoys me when someone comments that a problem wasn't treated enough or wasn't funny enough. Live through it and then make comments. I thought the film was fantastic and that everyone did an extraordinary job. Thanks for a trip (sad and good) at the bottom of the memory.
