My girlfriend and I have a thing for robots. So I try to look for movies with robots. And this movie has robots. The big ones. They beat the clang and slam into each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a limited budget. It is very difficult not to love this film. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! He made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. And special mention of veteran actor Paul Koslo: like the Russian maniac rascal, whether he is ruthlessly beating his defenseless opponents after they surrendered or complaining that their closeness to him in a bar caused his vodka to taste "like blood "(a phrase that delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) clearly has a ball and the film benefits enormously every time it is on the screen. This is a small film that deserves its reputation as a cult.
