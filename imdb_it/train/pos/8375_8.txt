<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a great little movie, ok some sets are bad and the acting is not great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age. You must remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made cheaply in 1st place, so you can't complain about the bad parts. So sit down and watch a fantastic movie with big and big robots.
