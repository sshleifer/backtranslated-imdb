I saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) for the first time and, since then, I've watched all his films that came on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and also resembles Owen) that oozes from the screen. I'm sure, if he puts on some meaty role, he'll create an Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> It's not to denigrate this movie at all. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, with very credible people (well, it's based on the author's first shenanigans with rocketry), an exceptional cast ?? Is Chris Cooper always good, and is Laura Dern always on my checklist ?? with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement ... and the fantastic soundtrack with so many old rock and roll to make your feet beat. <br /> <br /> But this film had a very special meaning for me: in 1957 I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked at the stars of the night to look at Sputnik as he moved through the darkness; like Homer, I also experimented with rocketry in my backyard and I also used the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts in an explosive disaster! How nice it was ... <br /> <br /> I didn't reach its great heights (metaphorical and physical). But that's what you find out when you see this movie. Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it looks like it's dying these days. Take the time to see it, with the children: you will have many good laughs.
