The Bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which emerged a wonderful rainbow haze of socio-cultural introspection, inspiring famous derivatives such as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3 and, more recently, The Wire. <br /> <br /> With multifaceted characters and narrative lines that have been described as "4-dimensional Shakespeare", The Bill grabbed you from the collars of episode one and didn't let you go. <br /> <br /> The show covered, anticipated, and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010. The most famous moment was the episode 19 of the series 5, broadcast on the eve of the second war of the Gulf. Detective Jim Carver's investigation - and ultimately the end of his career - the drug assault on Richardson's Craig "Fun Boy" apartment on Jasmine Allen's estate in early 2003 was widely considered an allegory predictive of the coalition's inability to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of Iraq several months later. <br /> <br /> However, it was the work the Bill did to try to highlight some of the lesser known problems experienced by police officers who won the most praises. This was a comprehensive drama covering such delicate areas as helmet phobia, under-uniform disguise, in-van homosexuality, lost batons, casual drunken bestiality (regret), siren aversion syndrome (SAS) , groin that hunts suspects while wearing a starched uniform and many, many other problems that still disturb, disturb, persecute and excite the officers to date. <br /> <br /> The last word should go to one of Bill's most famous fans, Nelson Mandela: "" It is not an exaggeration to say that I would not have been able to cross the dark darkness of solitude that summarized my last years of incarceration on Robben Island had it not been for the funny and funny buffoonery of Reg Hollis.
