One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where producers and the director were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, rather than for what people could expect. The lighting and the set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this one has a special name I can't think of). Dialogue is also unique in the sense that no contractions are used. The film is well structured, beautifully played and interesting from beginning to end. A real joy is MUSIC. Such a host of first-rate songs, from beginning to end, perfectly performed and orchestrated. Moreover, the music is very original and memorable, and I think it is superior to many musicals from the 30s to the 60s. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which could only have two or three. Not bad for a director without experience in this type of film. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
