Shot in the Heart is wonderful. Brilliantly illustrates the plight of Gary Gimore, a convicted murder requesting death. Shot in the Heart shows the experience that Gilmore's family, torn by hatred, went through. This film is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
