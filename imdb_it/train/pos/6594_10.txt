The tweed professor types thought they understood everything. Today's populations living in Polynesia descend from migratory Asians, passing fearlessly from the Far East, from island to island, east to Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the consolidated thought did not fit well with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If that explanation were true, how come some people born and raised in those islands have traditions, works of art and physical characteristics that do not resemble those of Asia, but of South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like the one found on the island thousands of miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders will point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that it is from there that their ancestors came, led by Tiki, their Adam equivalent? Meanwhile, how do the Norwegians talk about Scandanavian precursors who were hunted from the South American continent they colonized and, together with some of the native peoples they made friends with, headed for the sea - running WEST? It's all too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an incredible amount of moxie, a handful of crew members and local know-how for the traditional construction of the raft, an expedition begins. It is as much a journey in the human imagination as a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the bases of the instruments and the navy. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in its tone and in the Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it hovers with a spirit of adventure that surpasses even the space program launched a decade later, as men are willing to risk everything to test a theory that they think is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an incredible turntable and the perfect set for the newsreel-style movie.
