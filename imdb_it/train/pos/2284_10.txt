This is very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. I am very impressed by the film, not only for the plot and superb acting, but a film so unique was made. Most movies that involve a spy or a war are full of slick talking English or a mighty battle, but not this one. This is not this type of war, it is a war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of an evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will return home as a hero, but his true heroic position must remain a government secret. Back in America, Campell meets with both Nazi and Nazi supporters, creating interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. More than just bringing out the role, and it fits the plot pretty well for what it's asking.
