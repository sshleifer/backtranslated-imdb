A year after losing the gorgeous Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) to love rival Tarzan, the hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to get another blow to the heart of the dark-haired girl. Mixing business with pleasure, he also intends to take a little ivory from the elephant cemetery that lies beyond the escarpment of Mutia, the swinging terrain of Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his slimy and sleepy friend Martin Arlington and a group of expendable bearers, Harry finally arrives at his destination (having narrowly avoided death at the hands of native savages and monkeys monkeys) just to find out that Jane is still infatuated with her muscular yodeller, and worse, that Tarzan refuses to let the hunters take the ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nasty Arlington decides to settle things ambushed and shooting the ape-man and then tells Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Certainly, Tarzan is not dead, only wounded; after being restored to health by Cheetah (!), he returns to action just in time to save Jane from a tribe of ferocious lion-eating eaters who attacked Holt's expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his companion, the second film that plays Weismuller as the jungle man of few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; although I prefer the original slightly, I can certainly understand the popularity of the film: it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! The unquestionable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty smoky scenes, and with both stars wearing full-waisted outfits, there is a lot of pleasure for spectators of both sexes (despite the very touted O'Sullivan's nude scene actually performed by a double body, the pretty girl still shows a lot of skin, even threatening to make a "Sharon stone" at some point while her flap strip goes from a side!). <br /> <br /> The film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater battle between Tarzan and a crocodile, and the spectacular finale in which Jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is saved by her boyfriend, his monkey friends and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode (once again, sometimes the violence is surprisingly bad, although for me, there is nothing more shocking than the ferocious pygmies and the their gorilla from the first movie). Cheetah also has his fair share of excitement, dodging rhinos, crocs and big cats, riding on Tarzan's back as he crosses a river, and jumps on an ostrich for a ride. <br /> <br /> Like his predecessor, Tarzan and his companion suffer slightly from some negative effects and unconvincing props: dodgyback projection, some ridiculous monkey outfits, other Indian elephants disguised as African cousins ​​and poorly disguised trapeze swings , but these should not spoil the fun of this very funny movie. If anything, make it even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
