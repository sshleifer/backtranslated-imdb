Writer / director John Hughes has covered all the bases (as usual) with this bitter-sweet "Sunday Afternoon" family film. "Curly Sue" is a sweet and precocious orphan, cared for since childhood by "Bill". The couple lives carefree while traveling in the large United States by A. Fate compares them with a "very nice" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this film, as they may refer to heroin, played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who became the "you go girl!" of Pepsi commercials). The character is supposed to be around 6 or 7 years old, as he is urged to think about going to school. Some of his words suggest that she is 9 years old every day. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Home Alone", there is a lot of slaps and punches that punch big big minds. Once again, this is the "formula" film production, aimed at a young audience. Funny and moving. Don't look for surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
