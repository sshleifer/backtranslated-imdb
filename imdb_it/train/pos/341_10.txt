I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was finished. The cast was excellent, the plot was full of suspense and entertainment, and it was just a pleasant and general film! I would rate it as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls were also very nice, especially Denise Richards. It was very strange for the whole movie and gave his character some OOMPH!
