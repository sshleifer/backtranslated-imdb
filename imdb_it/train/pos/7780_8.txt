Robert Stack has never lost the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" at Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in "Lust for Life". Stack impersonates the deeply disturbed alcoholic son of an oil magnate. He lived his life in the shadow of the friend he grew up with, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. Both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut in love with Mitch. Their story takes place in a glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the field of melodrama with some incredible films, including "Imitation of Life", "All that Heaven Aows", "Magnificent Obsession" and many others. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - this is a pot-boiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone do most of their roles, Malone winning an Oscar for best supporting actress. There is an incredible scene, mentioned in other comments, where she dances wildly at loud music while her father collapses and dies on the stairs. We are led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the boy who pumps the gas, because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. He is so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he would be so anxious to get there today, no matter how much he was in love. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who cleaned up Kyle's Pasticcia all his life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the most volatile support players. <br /> <br /> In the hands of Sirk, "Written on the Wind" is an effective film, and the great scene towards the end in the villa is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and although he had many imitators, he had never had a peer.
