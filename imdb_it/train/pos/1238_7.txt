While this film has many flaws, it is actually a funny movie from the 80s. Eddie Murphy reaches his 80s here. While his character is indistinguishable from previous films, his timing is almost perfect with perfect partners and foils. Combining this with Charlotte Lewis's hypnotic beauty, this is a fun action comedy movie. <br /> <br />
