Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a pan. . . If you don't mind the psycho-thriller or horror genre, and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted, this is the movie for you. An incredibly well-developed first film, "Hatred of a Minute" has all the mainstream hits as "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics like "Army of Darkness". Editing and effects are well done, better than many such films. Kallio weaves an intricate story of torments drawing on both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when the budget is large, big-name films lack substance, the independent film has brought to light this dying trait. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, take a look at "Hatred of a Minute".
