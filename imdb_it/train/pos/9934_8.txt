"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and "nauseating" photography. The detractors mention his superficiality and criticize his "style on substance" deployment I could not agree more. I believe "Domino" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film career. <br /> <br /> After creating the dominant Hollywood style of filmmaking in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tony Scott has gradually come closer to a more subjective style of cinema. Already in "Crimson Tide" Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and the drama inherent in the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with the angle. This was then led to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game" which visually represented the world of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a move in a more aesthetic pictorial expressionist. Here Scott used an old-fashioned crank camera and flash frames to express the explosive rage of his character. Although not entirely successful, he introduced the techniques that would find their full expression in "Domino" <br /> <br /> Crouched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation "Domino" presents the life of the notorious bounty hunter through his narration fragments of disjointed memory. Grab memories like all of us - in fragments, flashes and short fragments. While Domino transmits his story verbally, Scott visually relates it illustrating not only the events he describes, but also the point of view that guides them. She has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is still unusual - that of a woman who has avoided luxury life for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> It's when Domino starts to relate the events that lead to his imprisonment that Scott really lets go. Together with filmmaker Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of the contemporary American. Little by little we begin to realize that, however unusual Domino may be, it is no longer disconnected from the "90210" culture that it rejected. As he traverses this cultural melange, Scott makes his observer more aware of the innocence he destroys through the disadvantaged children that fiction introduces. In the end Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape route we have from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this film for being excessively stylized is like criticizing Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is recognizably human. Like any large painting, the meaning of "Domino" is on the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I am in no way associated with Scott Free but I have always been and will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work
