This episode of Columbo is probably most noticed for the director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his first films. He should be watched for the role of Jack Cassidy as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy will appear in another Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his game in the character of Jack Cassidy. He is a mysterious writer who plots to execute the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying owner / widow of the general store that would have blackmailed him for money. Rather than losing more money, he kills her. It is very fun to look at Cassidy and Falk as always. The familiarity of Falk as Columbo makes it watchable after having repeatedly seen this episode over the years. What television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to see the shows over and over again if they like characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, it's Columbo's familiarity and his liking that has a high score with viewers like me.
