When I started watching the show I said "Oh, no! It's as rude as Elfen Lied and not even the damned one!" And in fact, the setup is almost identical, with the single guy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly involved in a fantastic adventure while sexy girls come to live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where the similarity stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as that in Inuiyasha, while observations and childish behaviors are very few. The magical setting is a bit trivial, because there are about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all the servants are famous, half of the teachers are from the same school, the rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon obscures and vanishes from the beauty of the design and the script. <br /> <br /> I actually saw all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it to the anims I liked best, but they came from other genres, I must say that I was very happy
