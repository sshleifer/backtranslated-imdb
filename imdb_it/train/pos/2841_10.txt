As a fan of Paris Je'aime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I gladly went out with all my expectations fulfilled. It was fun, sweet, fast and fun. The film begins with two booths (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha) trying to reach the same area but discuss which direction to go. It was fun, and then the movie fits into some of the best skits I've ever seen anywhere. There were four fantastic ones among all the good ones. Those four I'll talk about. One introduces Shia LaBeouf as a bellboy in a hotel that finds love in an old lady. The next sees Orlando Bloom as a musician who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another presents Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to the dance, the character of Thirbly is handicapped. The best is that of Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an old quarrelsome couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an important directorial debut direction, and is writing a skit on a guardian, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirt and a prostitute. New York, I Love You is definitely good, if not better than the 2006 Je'Taime in Paris. The scenes have a fast pace and the film shows how indie films should be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an incredible amount of great shows, and simply have fun, then definitely go see New York, I Love You.
