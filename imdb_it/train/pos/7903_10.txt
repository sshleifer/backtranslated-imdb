I saw this film the first few seconds of the T.R. he took me on the road - well I didn't like big thumbs glued to the beginning, but the absurd humor and the undecided looks of both sissy actors - I don't know who played his young girl - but she was fantastic and so was uma! !! - <br /> <br /> the other two people who went out in the cinema after about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always a test to see a movie that I really like with one of my friends - and, there we both had fun at the same time - hilarious laughter - sadness for the "realistic police normalos". both of us fans of the T.Robbins books ... I found it well done - I thought, that Robbins would have even approved, even if I have no idea if he liked the movie or not ... <br /> <br /> I'd like to see things cut off - I heard that gus v. Sand had to pull out many scenes because of viewers for the first time (or producers ???) yet it is still an artistic film. too short though ... it's one of my favorites of all time - and I'm aware that most people don't like that kind of movie and assume that people who like movies are what they think ... ... .what a pity. we hope the day will come when there will be a DVD with all the material - hoping to see more of crispy kispan - expecting to see his baby and everyone <br /> <br /> if you have the chance to see it, think twice and have fun if you have made the choice to look ... m
