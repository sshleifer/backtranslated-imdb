16 years have passed since its original run, I would have hoped that by now a "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live version of this classic by now, or at least tried to republish the original 65 episodes. cartoons did not solve the problem. The Galaxy Rangers actually had well-designed plots and even better scripts. The animation was of above-average quality for its time, and was excellent when compared to today's animated Japanese animation slide. It preceded the heavy tie of toon toys in the market, this could have sealed his fate too. I would like to spend cash on a GR DVD, if available.
