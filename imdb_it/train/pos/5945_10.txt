Allow me to make one thing clear for the most part, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly leaves me in general and even more specifically in relation to the treatment of very beloved and iconic comic book pages. Why? Well, let's take a typical scenario of the meeting of the Hollywood executive council to illustrate us ... <br /> <br /> Manager n. 1 "Hey, there's a lot of dollars to glean from superhero movies nowadays." <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 "Good point, let's do one quickly then! ?? We'll make a lucky dive in a hat and choose a random superhero to base a movie on!" (The dive happens and the name of a famous superhero is extracted) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Great! Now, who can we play the part? <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 "Who is a big box office right now?" <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 '* name of the great actor * is the beauty of this week.' <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 "Does it really fit the role? I mean it doesn't look like the character in any way." <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Who cares ?! It's a great name; In any case, we will make the film with him ". <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2" You are absolutely right! And then we will fill the whole film so full of gorgeous special effects to appease the moral masses that no one will ever be able to question in any case! '<br /> <br /> The scenario above clearly illustrates one of the reasons why I generally hate the most modern superhero movies. All the style, no substance and simply the pathetic cast of iconic leads. Of course to be fair, there are exceptions to the previous rule; when did Hollywood understand? take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies. <br /> <br /> But back to the general negative traits shown by Hollywood today ?? .. wouldn't it be wonderful if our studio managers ALWAYS had to choose actors that actually fit the roles? Well, in this world that is anything but ideal, a director does just that or not, merging actors based on their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts. His name is Sandy Collora. Sadly (but generally) Hollywood has not yet allowed Collora to direct a feature film, but fortunately for us, it gave us tantalizing glimpses of how the final result would probably be in the form of two (so far) famous short superhero features. One is the superb Batman: Dead End and the other is this fake trailer for an entirely fictional film called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, don't we break our words here? this is absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> The casting of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn, (which seemed equally impressive but completely wasted in the barbarian Barbarian) is the perfect choice for the iconic steel man to play . In fact, in terms of physical similarity, there has undoubtedly been no closer approximation to the comic book character. <br /> <br /> Added to this Clark Bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrait as the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead Fine; Again, yet another extremely judicious casting piece! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If only this was really a real feature film! Hollywood study executives ?? take note! THIS is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I am once again intrigued by the widely divided reactions that this short film has evoked by the fans. To be sure, the most bitter and violent adverse reactions against it clearly return once again (as in a similar way to Batman: Dead End) from a younger, less cinematically expert audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive patterns and by the liberal use of basic diction. Such an unfortunate state of mental closure is indeed a sad phenomenon, even if one of our above-mentioned Hollywood executives will undoubtedly be very satisfied. After all, these same wrong individuals are in all probability exactly the same kind of CGI addicts, fools of popcorn who enjoy most of the shit that Hollywood churns out these days.
