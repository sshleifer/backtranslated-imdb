On October 24, 1955, Hadley Oil Company's hard geologist Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) met executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in his boss Bill Ryan's office in New York and invited her to attend a playboy conference alcoholic and son of a magnate Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confesses that he traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the daredevil Kyle, who is his best friend since childhood, to eat a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to Kyle's father, Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle uses his money without success to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and has an unmatched crush on Mitch who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle finds out he has a problem and could be sterile and start drinking again. The jealous Marylee poisons Kyle telling that his wife and Mitch are having a romance. When Lucy finds out she is pregnant, Kyle believes the child belongs to Mitch and his distrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an overvalued melodramatic soap opera, with characters and artificial situations. There are at least two great films with characters with alcohol problems: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with the splendid performance of Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with the fantastic performance by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and his character's drinking motifs are superficial and clich√©. In the end, the memorable "Written on the Wind" is just fun and never a feature to be nominated for an Oscar. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
