It's wonderful! In Story mode, you go from punk to professional. You must complete goals that involve skating, driving and walking. Create your skater and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric for the duration of the game until he betrays you and has you kicked by the skateboard team (you can choose a team to be active) and then start your team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of the story mode) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your goals like SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create the pedestrian goal and write what they talk about. If you get bored doing it, you can make premade goals in premade parks. The only thing I didn't like about this game was that sometimes it was difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
