Once in a lifetime it means that he is once a thug, always a thug, and no one enters or leaves "Life" for free. Neighborhood delinquents in New York sell drugs and do fraud because they can't do it in the legitimate world, perhaps because they have criminal records or drugs, or because they're just lazy. This simple story with a couple of twists on mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion from the audience to its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for one another. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays the role of 20/20 Mike (all hooligans have nicknames) and is based on his game, "Riff Raff". It looks like a game from start to finish, especially during the longest scene in which the three main players place themselves to decide who can be considered reliable. Often the dialogue comes very quickly, much faster than it would be on stage, and I think it's the biggest flaw in the film. Mixed as flashbacks throughout the film are street poems, a sort of rap of the iambic pentameter, which is violent and evocative of the world that this film reveals. Poetry makes it difficult to liquidate these men, these thugs who kill, cheat and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is too stupid, another a drug addict, and the last one suffers from conscience while the public marvels, or even laughs, at the irony of the executioners who ask him hanging from the gallows to tell jokes in the middle of his disappearance.
