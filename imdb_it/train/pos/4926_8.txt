Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors that this country has ever had, has proved to be equally at home with movies. With "Panic in the Streets", Mr. Kazan offers us an early version of what would come next, with perhaps his masterpiece, "On the Waterfront", although both films share only the setting of the water, because they are different visions on different subjects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan filmed on site in New Orleans. The adaptation of Daniel Fuchs of the stories of Edna and Edward Anhalt that are the basis of the film, is remarkable as it takes us to places that no tourist has dared to see by visiting "The Big Easy". One of the great advantages of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography of Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best. Also the music of Alfred Newman and the song of Billie Holiday give the film a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This film may have been shot in New York or another major northern city because it presents us with characters who speak more like "broklynese" than perhaps a Southern accent that could be heard in that part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing appears clear in the film, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smolder the screen every time you see it It was so intense! At the same time, this guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is suffering from a fatal disease. Blackie, comfort this man who caresses his sweaty face and runs his hands through his greasy dying hair with abandon. Also noteworthy is the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to have done their stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real. <br /> <br /> The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man who paints furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife discuss how it seems they can't balance their salary, which many families face on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, interpreting a normal person, is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, like his wife, sounds like a suburban Connecticut woman. <br /> <br /> The film is fun thanks to the direction of Mr. Kazan and the excellent cast that works in the film.
