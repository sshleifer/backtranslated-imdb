Normally, I don't watch action films because they are usually all very similar. This film had many stereotypical action film scenes, but the characters and the originality of the film's premise made viewing much easier. David Duchovny has bent his normal acting approach, which was nice to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and performed well. Great cast all together. A must see for people bored by the same old action movie.
