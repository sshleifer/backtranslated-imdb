I just took the DVD release of this film while on vacation in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and played in a powerful way. The young man who plays "Frits" the main character has a surprisingly open face that painfully reflects the tragic events that take place around him. <br /> <br /> In the film we soon see that the father Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is raised when the brutal principal denies attacking the boy and suggests that he was his father. <br /> <br /> The climate scene in which Frits refuses to show respect for the headmaster; just standing and repeating 'Liar' while being brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you will probably never forget. <br /> <br /> The weak point of the films is the 'Flower Power' rather clich√© teacher who uses every "friendly teacher" trick in the book. On top of that, I'm sure this is a movie that you'll really like.
