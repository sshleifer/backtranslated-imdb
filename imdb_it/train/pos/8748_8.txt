I think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! or damn Australian? I don't know yet, but what I do know is that I really enjoyed this movie but it couldn't be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> Great story with great actors but with a terrible end ... To make you cry and say 'Oh, she is so good' ... Yet, who made it? What really happened? Who's that boy? No answers to these questions ... <br /> <br /> Mysterious film with a good general grade ... I give it an 8/10, going on 8.5!
