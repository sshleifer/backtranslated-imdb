Finally I could watch this classic TV movie on an unofficial record recorded by an old VHS, it's a horror classic. It is a pity more than this overlooked corner of horror in terms of official versions on DVD and VHS ... the television horror film. Recommended to all fans of the TV movie of the 70s very similar to the trilogy of terror. Interested parties should obtain the book on the subject of David Deal - Television Fright Films from the 1970s. Send me an email to get the chance to see it ..... it's great to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems like many TV movies that need to be quite imaginative in effects and even at 70 minutes it may seem to drag it, maybe we are all used to more modern editing, but still great stuff and much better than many scares theatrical releases published today.
