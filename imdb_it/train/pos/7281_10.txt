I saw this movie for the first time at a local station during the Sunday afternoon horror show around 1969 or 1970. Not cut. At the time I was just a kid, but I loved it and I wasn't really scared. I thought it was such a beautiful and very original plot. Looking back, I am still surprised that it was shown during the day on T.V. uncut in those years. Since then I've been looking for this movie, I've seen it over and over again and I've always loved it. One might think that John Waters would have idolized this film. It must be not only a scary movie, but one of the most squalid and trashy films of all time. And surprisingly, we don't hear about this being followed up by the cult that a film like "Blood Festival" or "The Hills Have Eyes" have acquired over the years. It has a cult following, but I think it should have become a cult classic. As far as I know, this came out just before Blood Feast came out, making this probably one of the first real "gore" movies. Indeed, this film contains elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a bit of Russ Meyer screened for good measure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend it to all those who love trashy horror movies, shabby, black and white from the early 1960s (I think the date is in the end of 1960).
