Released a few months before the end of the war, "Anchors Aweigh" is one of the main musical triumphs of the 1940s by Gene Kelly ?? <br /> <br /> Under the direction of George Sidney, did he have the benefits of a pleasant score and, best of all, the services of Gene Kelly in his first real starring role at MGM ?? The year before, in Columbia's "Cover Girl", he had revealed an innovative approach to on-screen dance, a light but pleasant singing voice and a remarkable fascination in "Anchors Aweigh", although it was advertised by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, was laying the solid foundation for his most revealing years at MGM ?? <br /> <br /> The story of the film, a sort of dry run for "On the Town" four years later, follows the sailors Kelly and Sinatra on leave, spending their holidays in Hollywood, where they are involved in the business of an aspiring singer (Grayson) and his grandson (Dean Stockwell). Grayson, it seems, has his heart in an audition with conductor Jose Iturbi ?? You receive the audition, of course; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings; and Sinatra, he forgot he was shy, and lost his heart for a Brooklyn girl (Pamela Britton). <br /> <br /> The plot is conventional for the period but, unfortunately, now it seems barely tolerable ?? But is there Gene Kelly, who dominates the film with his pleasant personality ?? Perhaps he smiles too much, but when he is allowed to dance, does the film finally rise from the ground? <br /> <br /> "I Begged Her", his first song and dance with Sinatra, is fun and a bit absurd, in which he imagines himself as a chief bandit in a Spanish courtyard, courting young Grayson with a flamenco flamenco and some athletic jumps ?? Does he also do a fascinating Mexican dance with little Sharon McManus in the square of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles ?? <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film, however, is Kelly's famous dance featuring the cartoon character Jerry the Mouse (from "Tom and Jerry" fame). Delightful and innovative, he cleverly combines live action and animation in his story of a sad mouse who refuses to give music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor from the "Pomeranian Navy", who wears a striped shirt and a beret, show him how to dance ?? "Look at me, I'm dancing!" says the cheerful king of the mouse ...
