This could not have been better. The strong restrictions on Mike Sullivan's expressions could not be portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks offers the best performance of his career. The young Tyler Hoechlin leads an emotional wheel; playing the basic character for the story. And the veteran Paul Newman has given one of his best interpretations of characters for a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a bold novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father / son story that basically employs the two candidates only unsuitable for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney welcomed him. Despite being a generous man, Mr. Rooney became involved in organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debt had to be repaid only by engaging in the business. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe, but at the same time he repays his boss. The events to follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With a great adaptation by David Self, dialogue rarely comes out, but at the same time is very virtuous. The story takes place in a beautiful setting of the 1930s (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh) covered by a dark and rainy exterior (snow on the ground). Leading the story is the wonderful Irish soundtrack by Thomas Newman, which is installed only when needed. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element of the film is the beautiful photograph of Conrad L. Hall. This is one of the best cinemas I've seen; and I watch a lot of movies. The scene where Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is pretty impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. Next, he turns to the side of the car, to see Michael (Hoechlin) wake up and peek out the side window. As he continues, he crosses the trucks and dollies to the side, completely around the car and reveals a marvelous scenic 1930s Chicago. <br /> <br /> With a cast and a top-level crew, the main man creates a blatantly fantastic film. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (won him several prizes) Before American Beauty, Mendes worked as a theater director for the British Theater, but decided he wanted to go on to say that there was nothing new for him in the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes distinguished himself in my book as one of the great directors (in a list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film illuminates a cheeky genre that has its strokes and lacks and brilliantly expresses the true theme. Photography, acting and history are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for the Scorsese of Gangs of New York, but for now I'm fully confident in saying that this is the "Best Film of the Year". Considering his competition (Insegne, Insomnia, Minority Report) this is a strong statement.
