This film was one of the best films I've seen this year. I didn't see any cameo in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better film. It actually has a point. If you see a lot of T & A you will be disappointed. Only a well-made film !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find that this is really a good movie. I certainly think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this film is right. I mean, I don't really like Ebert in most movies, but this is the film I agree with. The film contains a pretty good story that is actually credible that these kinds of people are out there. There is certainly something to be said about how they treat virginity in this film. Yes, of course, it makes you laugh when it is discovered, but still suggests that you wait. Steve did a great job in portraying the person he played in this film, yet it's still fun.
