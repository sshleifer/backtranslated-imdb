This film now appears on digital TV at least once a month, I've seen it a dozen or more times and it never ceases to delight me. If it were tomorrow, I would look at it again. Such is the artistic ability that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the acting profession, can create, helped in no small way by the superb support trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Without forgetting the others in minor roles. <br /> <br /> It is a simple story, simply told, of a former swindler, an adorable embezzler, who fights and succeeds with the then "new age technology", ie computers, and finds affection in the process. Even if it is a little (tongue in cheek) implausible, not even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no scurrilous language, and above all there is no terrible action of the method that is so widespread today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show from, and with, virtually nothing ... except exceptional talent.
