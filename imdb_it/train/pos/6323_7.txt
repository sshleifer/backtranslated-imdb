"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the funniest dialogues in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo it reminded us of perhaps another film we had seen in the past, but since we lost the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to find out that what was remembered was 1958 The Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, in it, can't be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece, all the characters have an opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The film presents us with a group of inane potential crackers from hell. No one could think that these men could do a job like the one they undertake. Whatever may go wrong, and more, is what they can do. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the sure master cracker who is also seen to be impersonating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these little time scammers do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see this band is condemned from beginning to end!
