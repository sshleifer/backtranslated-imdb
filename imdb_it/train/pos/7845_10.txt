So Fox removed the plug in the middle of a drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How lame is it? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens? Why weren't the other episodes broadcast in the United States? They have been transmitted elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening? This was a great show, but you left us hanged. If you introduce new dramas / mysteries, at least the air will be a conclusion before abruptly interrupting the central theme. Whenever something similar happens (and it seems to happen a lot with you - Fox), there are more than those who "wait and see" before investing their time. This means that you will see an artificially low interest rate and that it is more likely to end the series. To see? It's a vicious circle. Don't disappoint us yet ...
