I'm curious to know which Beckett rifle he was using in the film, and also the caliber of the bullet he was supposed to shoot. If this is freely based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I guess it's a 7mm. round. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. He also made a comment in Sniper's final movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese allowed him to use one that belonged to his father. Beckett said he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I'd like to know what the gun is. I know this particular gun was created around the Second World War or before. I couldn't see it close enough by watching the movie to identify it. As for Mr. Hathcocks, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed killings and 14 unconfirmed kills. After his wounds were healed somehow after being burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the USMC the skills they needed in the field. His sniper career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters who train in the USMC. I discovered his name from my friend who is a former marine. Any information would be great.
