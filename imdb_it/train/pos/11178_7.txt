MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> A little underestimated Stephen King shocker. It's not perfect, with any imaginative effort - even if the soft performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there would still be the badly managed mystical elements of the story to be addressed. The old cemetery of Micmac, Rachel's terminally ill sister, and Jacob Marley, a Victor Pascow, never unite in something coherent, and the film in places seems confused and overflowing. But few horror films are really perfect and what may be lacking in other areas makes up for it in its will to shock. "Pet Sematary" may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous baby zombie and its insanely insensitive portrait of Zelda. It's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's free - yet it makes us boil with revulsion in a way that the most "safe" horror movies can never. Add to that of Fred Gwynne's best performances and the witty director of Mary Lambert, and you have an intensely satisfying film of fear - even with the hockey finale. Highly recommended for fans of the genre. 7.5 out of 10.
