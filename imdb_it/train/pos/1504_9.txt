Four great stories of the master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors of the sector in the early seventies, are the basis of this excellent production of Amicus. It was kind of a very popular movie in the sixties until the mid-seventies and it's one of my favorite horror movies. This in particular shines with the episode Sweets to the Sweet, in which Christopher Lee is chased by his wicked child, heir to the maternal tradition. Great fun from start to finish, and from good to very good are the other three episodes (with the last one a little on the comic side, but with the great addition of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire of English cinema.
