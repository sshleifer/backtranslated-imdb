Slow but splendidly mounted story of the American revolution. Griffith's story seems much less heavy than it was in his previous historical epics and his work on tableaux is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is a real pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but charming and Carol Dempster is .... well, Carol Dempster is most of what is wrong with Griffith during this time, but it doesn't show up often enough to slow down the pace and the drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the curiosity for this film says that it was originally originally just over 2 hours when it was released, but that there is no cut that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the DVD version was presented with a slower fps frequency which increases the tension and brings it back a little over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in terms of storytelling than of audio versions, such as IL PATRIOTA. Although not entirely in line with the best of Griffith, like WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.
