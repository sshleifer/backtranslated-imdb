So often a band will gather for a reunion concert only to find that they can't get it together. It is not so here. This concert is simply brilliance from beginning to end. These three musicians obviously got together early and planned and planned what was needed to ensure that this was not just a nostalgic refusal to satisfy someone's ego. This is obvious from the start, even before getting on stage. Many faces in the crowd weren't even born when these guys performed for the first time. From the first song they captured that old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had to stretch for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc. So we could see it at its best. Ginger Baker shows why today many drummers talk about him as a kind of drum guru. Jack Bruce is simply fantastic. They really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come. This is a 10 for me.
