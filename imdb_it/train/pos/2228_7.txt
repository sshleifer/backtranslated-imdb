The main problem I see with this film is its score, which screams with each note: "This is a good ass movie". There's not much more to say here. The score is simply sucked. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I see quite severe and which involves unraveling the plot towards the end of the film (one of the throws of money, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman), in which Martha turns out to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very aware that he is listening to a cinematic dialogue. In other words, the suspension of disbelief stops here. The integrity of a credible dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a voluntary injection of information that film producers wish to convey to the public. <br /> <br /> The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While sincerely believing that you are a fabulous actress in your work, I feel that this part may have been excessive. The main point of his performance that didn't seem to fit was the specter through which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a family in difficulty to a woman almost Rambo on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a trait for every actress, and Barbeau cannot be blamed too much. To the extent that he played his part competently enough, however, I would call this only a moderately serious problem for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did a great job in the first half of a creep factor, particularly during its horror flashes. I feel the film would have benefited from a greater commitment to these flashes as a mechanism to prevent the creep factor fiasco in the second part of the film. <br /> <br /> So what is my holistic evaluation of this piece? I'd give a solid C + to B-, depending on how much credit you're willing to provide to producers for making this film on a limited budget. Even with two serious and two moderately serious problems, the film is based on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development or consistency; the dialogue, with the famous exception mentioned above, is definitely brilliant in some points, in particular the important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; as mentioned, the sliding factor was well realized, if a little sparkling in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also produced a film, produced a splendid performance. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film certainly deserves a look --- see it with a Nazi you love. :)
