Well, not really. This movie is a lot of fun though. I went and saw him with the girl last night and I had to use the "I think there might be something in my eyes" routine. The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a terrifying journalist who has the power to change himself and the city where he resides. Actually all the characters are fantastic. The film is not overly funny or mushy, a good movie to go see with his wife. <br /> <br /> All in All 8/10 .... notes * I'm not an easy grader. That's all from the outside and from BigV!
