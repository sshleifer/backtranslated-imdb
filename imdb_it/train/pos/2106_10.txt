Would the most romantic comedies be performed as cleverly as this? I never thought anything so trivial as the simple sale of a music box could let me catch my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan is a wonderful saleswoman, and she and James Stewart have always shown the best of each other. This film is what I think is the most successful performance by Frank Morgan, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" on the belt, he is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me with a dizzy joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought that "Trouble In Paradise" was his favorite, but this must surely be considered a triumph. With some of the most voluptuous dialogues, American films of the 1930s have to offer.
