This was one of the best movies I've seen. The film refers to real life and how drugs can play an important role. Although this film seems to be produced by a low budget, I found it to be hilarious to watch. <br /> <br /> Some may not like the plot and say that the script is without direction. However, when a person becomes as drugged as these characters, there is no direction is life. I believe this film is an accurate representation of what could happen to a person if he is faced with extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast are newcomers in the industry. However, they have all come out very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and enter the character appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this film could be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one involved in the drug and it seems to be spiraling out of control. This movie could scare them enough to change their ways.
