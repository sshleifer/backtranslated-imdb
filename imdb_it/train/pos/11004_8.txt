In the near future, the common man above suspicion of the suburb Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is hired by Digicorp, a huge company, to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, Sunways. During his training, Morgan is subjected to brainwashing, assumes a new identity as Jack Thursby and travels to boring lessons. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advises him that he has nothing. Morgan recognizes a new reality, in which he does not know who can be trusted. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a great surprise for me. This film was not released in Brazil, but the compelling and exciting story is rather complex, with many points in the plot, and with great script, direction and performance. In the last turn, I mentioned "Total Recall" by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film certainly deserves to be seen more than once, and I didn't really like the last scene, when the independent spy arranges the disc discussed at sea. I only know the director Vicenzo Natali of the fantastic "Cube", and this second work I see is also amazing. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
