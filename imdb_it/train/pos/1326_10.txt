I saw this movie at a college film festival in the 1970s - I ALWAYS waited for this film to be released on video (it finally came out). It was made in Brazil, so I thought it was because of that that he had not yet arrived at the video. I've checked the video stores for the last 15 years waiting for this great movie to come out! It's one of my all-time favorites - but beware, it's strange, as Werner Herzog is strange - his strangeness comes from his super-realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real accident some centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first met the tribes in the Amazon. A white man is mistaken for a wild tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. But before they send it, they make it part of their tribe (their custom). The whole film is like watching a National Geographic documentary while becoming an accepted member of their tribe. That's all. Cosmic plot? No. Deep intuition about the variety of human life? Definitely. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... be careful ... this film has a definite nudity - this is not a Hollywood schlock movie about wild nobles ... this movie tells how it was (reread above: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
