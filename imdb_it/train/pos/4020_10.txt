Pinjar by Mr Dwivedi is a fantastic film. It is certainly the most beautiful and the best of 2003. There are excellent performances in it. Dwivedi knows what it can extract from MAST Urmila. she's like you've never seen before. a real great performance. together with her is a good actor Manoj bajpai, who showed in Bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in Pakistan pre-partition. He comes from a Punjabi family who lives in a small town. she was kidnapped by a Muslim boy as part of a struggle that has lasted for years against the Punjabi family. and then follows a series of plot twists while Urmila's arranged marriage is expected in a few days. this movie is really a great movie. the plot is solid with an incredible script. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (you won't believe, but can also act, besides jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many others. those series with pakistan pre-partition, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add positive points. from the beginning to the end, did you stay with the next question? this film is not worthy of being seen but deserved to be part of your movie collection. the final scene is the end of the film. I would suggest to all those spectators No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai to watch this fantastic film. my vote: 10/10.
