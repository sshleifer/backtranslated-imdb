From the beginning I knew I would be for the best experience of watching movies of my life. The idea of ​​two giant robots, equipped by brilliant humans, fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought-out plot I've ever experienced. I can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and the well-written script. Let's just say that it is comparable to both images of the Lord of the Rings, combined. The Academy had a serious oversight in not celebrating the joy it is ..... ROBOT JOX.
