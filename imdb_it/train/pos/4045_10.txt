I'm so happy to have the chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. I saw it at an independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your city soon. During the film, I noticed that about 10 people get up and leave. Too bad for them (here in the south, people don't like to read subtitles). The film starts slowly, but it is so full of dialogues that I never got bored. When the action finally arrives, I found myself glued to the screen as if I were on a roller coaster. I also got a great kick of the chapter titles that appear before the chapters, especially those that introduce the characters as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you face level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "videogames / comics" movies, then I welcome it.
