Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adulterous wife of a great businessman who inherits $ 1 million of life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash during a business trip. She is initially suspected of being responsible as recently her husbands were changed and therefore has an insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her queue just to be sure. Baumer goes to Athens, Greece, to cash his inheritance, but insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch, whose identity is now known to Baumer, tries to protect her from a lover of her husband, Lara Florakis, who however, along with her henchman, Sharif tries to kill them both for a portion of the money he believes he is entitled to. And this is where our masked killer starts his brutal killings. Lynch, as is the custom of our hero, is initially suspected by the Greek police and is warned not to leave Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, known face in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then helped by the beautiful Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the murders. Saying anything else could ruin the movie to all those who haven't seen it, so suffice it to say that there are enough red herring and most of these are plausible that Mystery / Thriller fans are happy in this thriller inspired by a story. The No Shame DVD has a superb soundtrack transfer in both English and Italian. He also has a very catchy score only for good measure from Bruno Nicolai who will remain in your head for a while .... all in all a first quality yellow.
