Although the word megalmania is widely used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too rigid, you have to admit that the boy knows how to put on a show. In American In Paris, he choreographed some exceptional numbers, some that block the plot, but are still surprising to watch. (Check out "Getting Out Of Bed Routine" by Gene Kelly for starters) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly plays a GI who lives outside of Paris, stayed there to paint, is soon a gigolo rich woman, but she really loves SOMEONE ELSE! Hoary's story is safe, but the musical numbers save the show here! I really loved Georges Gu√¶tary's vocal work in this. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his duet with Le Gene on 'S Wonderful' is 'wonderful'. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron can take or leave. All in all, a rather good film, but not dynamic.
