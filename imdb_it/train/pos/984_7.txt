I ran into "Bait" by cable one night just as it started and I thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> "Esca" is not perfect. He suffers from an unnecessarily flashy direction and an occasional hardness. But overall, this film worked. All the elements were aligned, and they pulled out what might otherwise have been a rather ugly film. <br /> <br /> Most of this, I think, is due to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who has labeled Foxx as the protagonist, but whoever made this film was a big favor. Incredible and incredibly likeable, Foxx slips into the film, smooth as butter and more fun than hell. You can say that he is working on instinct, and instinct does not disappoint him. <br /> <br /> The plot, although not important, really connects well, and there is also a bow of character through which the Foxx character grows as a person. Again, they could have slipped without any of this, but it makes things much better. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the low rating of this. Maybe I just took this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
