People don't expect anything less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a film, and this movie is no exception. Some movies that I love have hurt the box office, but, I'm glad to say, this film is not one of them (over nine million dollars, which I don't think was bad by then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I didn't think that Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for young children (the targeted audience for this film), but I thought that what had happened to the creepy professor in the end was a bit too dark for the kids "movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and fascinating classic that I've loved dearly for years.
