I happened to see this film in a screening in Brooklyn: it is difficult to describe the plot; it has a lot of extravagant characters, but let's say I would have trouble choosing which made me laugh louder, I wouldn't know where to start. Even the peripheral roles are well written and well performed. <br /> <br /> There are numerous small touches that make it unique and very fun, it has some "devices" that appear and add another hilarious layer. It's refreshing to watch; not some recycled things I had seen many times before. If this film could reach a wider audience, I am sure it would be a real pleasure for the crowd, the story is so original and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> Here there are many things to love, funny stories, misadventures and misunderstandings that gave birth to the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny film with a ton of heart; it's a moving story with a fast-paced comedy everywhere. Definitely worth seeing!
