Yes, it's another great Muppet magic movie and I love them all; the characters, the movies, the episodes of the TV series (it's the best comedy or musical TV series ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they made such a rare fatal mistake and I'm definitely talking about the strange ending !! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to involve so much in the American drama and end a love affair with marriage !! We, like all poor spectators, feel so free or perhaps happy for the absence of his annoyance, your discontent and your unhappiness! So we enjoy all these stories that collect two nice heroes as a couple in love without the legitimate link like Mickey and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous couples and their likes I bet you feel safe, peaceful and peaceful. So when you look at what the creators of this movie have done, you'll be crazy about me! <br /> <br /> They made the weak wretched creature (Kermit) marry his daily nightmare, the most painful female of all time (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change in the measures of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the public that refused to bless or believe or be satisfied by that sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the opportunity to think or decide something!). So it's no wonder you know that this film is the most failed of their cinema, collecting only 25 million compared to the 65 million earned by the first (The Muppet movie of 1979) five years earlier !! <br /> <br /> In this film they simply took Manhattan, and also my rest!
