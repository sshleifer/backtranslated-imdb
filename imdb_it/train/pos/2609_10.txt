I'm writing this 9 years after the final episode aired and I'm still recovering from the impact Wildside has had on me. <br /> <br /> It actually went where numerous other crime movies went and were successful. But it went further and did not move away from the realism of the streets, often portraying life events and characters up to a T. <br /> <br /> I definitely miss this series, instead they gave us the stupid "Underbelly" that it is dramatized and acted out creating a whole load of American esquire trash. <br /> <br /> Wildside has remained faithful to the uniqueness of Sydney and for this I am really indebted to this wonderful series. The acting was A-grade and it's a shame to see only some actors have promoted their career while others have faded into darkness. <br /> <br /> I don't want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television story, so I ask the ABC to publish the complete series on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
