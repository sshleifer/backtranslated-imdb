This film is essentially about human relationships and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life begins a journey into her past, making an analysis of how she lived her life. This journey has fallen due to the economic crisis of the children and their intentions to put her in a nursing home. It is a very honest aspect of some problems that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are a lot of secondary ideas to discuss in this film like family heritage, true love, marriage or destiny. although this type of melodramatic film is not new, this can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance of the actors and the characters are very credible, but due to time some characters may not be fully developed. I highly recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
