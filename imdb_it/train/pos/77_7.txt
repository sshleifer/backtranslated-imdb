The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his magician performance. However, halfway through the highly successful show, the police arrive and stop him. It looks like his old boss tricked him into the tricks he had created - even the ones he'd made at his home in his house. As a result, Price rightly kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why the price was dead and most likely thought it was a GOOD thing, because Price was a little crazy, he couldn't stop at one (like eating Lay's Potato Chips). <br /> <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great twists and an exciting action. One thing that cannot be said about this film is that it is boring. Although it is anything but thin, it's fun everywhere, although it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN much more and scored an 8 or 9. That's because while THE MAD MAGICIAN is a movie wonderful, very reminiscent of the film that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX has been so successful, the formula has been re-hashed in the follow-up film. Both were made in 3-D, both have a storyline in which Price has all the justifications for killing, but he can't stop once he has committed the first and both are very fun to watch. The biggest differences, and there are few, are that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror film and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this movie AND HOUSE OF WAX (only the Price version). Both are fantastic 50s horror movies.
