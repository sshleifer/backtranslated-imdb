This is a bewitching and powerful Italian adaptation of the novel by James M. Cain The postman always rings twice directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that in any case it transcends its starting material to become something more audacious and original (in particular Camus attributes to Cain's novel the main inspiration for his leading novel The Stranger). The film has greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of the narrative structure of Cain, but offers a more complex exploration of the genre. Cain's American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of candor (the main character Cora is obsessively afraid of being identified as Mexican and embarrassed by the fact that he married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is working in. This allows class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate and condemned love story of the two main characters. This film is a complex experience, full of suspense and rewarding.
