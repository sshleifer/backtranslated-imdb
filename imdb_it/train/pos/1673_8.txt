A nice trip to Martino, this is a lively and fun yellow with beautiful performances by the good-looking cast and mainly the two protagonists, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me the plot enigma is so convoluted and confused you sit and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. Just when everything seems to be resolved, we are again involved in a further series of twists and turns, funny twists, it must be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy with lots of jerks kill this well-set movie with London, Athens and the Greek coastal resorts. A super final set on the rocks of the Aegean wraps things up and much has been enjoyed by everyone.
