Following a sitcom storyline is so incredibly easy that the fact that his character acts simultaneously both inside and outside the context, the rest of the cast is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use. The secondary characters found the show in a sitcom reality that provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's erratic character who, beyond the general insensitivity, has no specific recurring features for behavioral expectations on which to base herself, making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in each episode if not the scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an external perspective allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed. Every time he talks it's like an independent 5-second script. It stands out a lot, demonstrating the countless things that a smile or a change in vocal tone can mean, but it never sticks to an idea long enough to make you feel comfortable and form expectations that will be met. This could be the most creative, original and experimental TV program ever.
