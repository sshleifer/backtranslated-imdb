This animated film is a masterpiece! The narration, the music, the animation and the plot where everything is remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it again for a second time and got more information. We invited a couple of friends to see the Spirit with us and we loved it. When I asked them to come and see it, they thought it was a horse movie, but later they realized that it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse who smiles a lot in Dances with Wolves. The spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to enhance and inspire. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time and I want to go see it again. I liked the "Spirit" tremendously because his portrait of the American Indians is realistic, dignified and not stereotyped unlike the movie "The road to El Dorado", which was a total farce because he portrayed the American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotyped way. But Dreamworks has redeemed itself by making Spirit a great movie that I found acceptable! I hope they continue to make more animated movies like Spirit, and I'd like to see sequels or spin-offs for Spirit if it's done respectfully and without stereotyping American Indians. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.
