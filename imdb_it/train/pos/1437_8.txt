We often see films about undesirable things going on in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role he was born to interpret, Al Pacino plays the mayor of New York who has to take care of the shooting of a boy. But it turns out that nothing he does will really have any effect. In this film, the characters are as gritty as we would expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a certain politician, you may have your doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can't name any specific example of something like what this movie portrays, but this is not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this film brings these ideas down. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also played by John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
