Some films simply should not be redone. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad movie. But he fails to capture the taste and terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as always, and most of the cast, with the exception of Owen Wilson, did not give the right feeling to Luke's character. But the main flaw of this version is that it has strayed too far from the story of Shirley Jackson in his attempts to be great and lost some of the thrill of the previous film in a trade off for more snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in itself it is not a bad movie. But you will appreciate the friction of terror in the old version much more.
