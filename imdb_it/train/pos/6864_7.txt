I saw this movie the first time while I was drunk in a motel in Canada. While flipping through the channels he crossed the Easy Lube part. My friend kept shooting, but I told him to go back. Something about the name "easy lube" didn't seem right. I watched the rest of the movie was damn funny. I wrote down a couple of names from the credits and arrived home to look for it. It turned out to be the first Chevy Chase movie. I did not remember that. I didn't remember much, so I rented it and gave it a second view. It's pretty funny and quite graphic. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, except it's not so funny. I love the fingers, the easy lubricant, and I'm a fucking part president. The script of the merchants is also beautiful. I give him a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
