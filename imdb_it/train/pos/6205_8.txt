Convoluted, irritating and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to seduce but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. It is at the same time touching, fun, cunning. Even the supporting actors are committed to doing so. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you about the plot .. It involves characters from Hartley's Henry Fool and attempts a history of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The film works well if you continue with it, the understanding is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous as you go forward. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something other than a cookie-cutter. In the end, it offers something that defies description.
