I verified it as a boost when browsing the movie store and I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together, and we loved it. It is not the typical "chick-flick" with a faded love story and tears that go all the way, but in the end it definitely touches nervousness. It is an ending in which, even if unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not damaged by it. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress in this film too, her debut, and this is certainly worth watching! I didn't recognize many of the secondary actors, but all of them play their important supporting roles well. "The Man in the Moon" is such a credible story about a young teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can certainly relate to everything, from Witherspoon's words, to his subtle looks and not so subtle emotions (raging like the typical teenage girl). While playing a confused character about love, he doesn't find her silly and immature, which was much appreciated considering many films today.
