This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim. <br /> <br /> It is filmed in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more chilling atmosphere to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes evident very soon because of this shooting technique. <br /> <br /> The gruesome characters are very well recited and presented in particular the "crazy". called Joe. However, healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for my taste - granted, they should look pathetic but this is done a little out of place. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly (and the ingenuity of the work with the movie camera of the movie "B" to start) and very normally, but soon there is the imminent brutality that is about to happen. This is one of the most "twisted" films compared to cold violence. <br /> <br /> After the abrupt and incredibly lazy finish, I felt disappointed. I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in line with the rest of the film, but given that it only gets a 7 on the strength of the "restlessness" and slightly biting scenes in the film. <Br /> <br /> Give him a watch and excuse the ending!
