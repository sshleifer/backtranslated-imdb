Very few films have had an impact on American culture like the Urban Cowboy. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost a class in itself as one of those films that when you browse the channels at 3:00 am you can't look away ... my first three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but that's next to the point. I remember that Urban Cowboy reached the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks that were opened at every corner, men wearing cowboy hats with their moccasins, and if you didn't know how to do two steps you are considered a social moron! I personally think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me in the wake of SatNiteFever. Who has a shot. It is also credible. The soundtrack is fantastic. Too bad that Charlene Tilton, of Dallas' fame for TV, ruined Johnny Lee's career because that boy was simply amazing. The show stealer here is Scott Glenn as the oldest ex-con-redneck cowboy. And I have nothing against a farther cowboy than myself, but I've always envied what I feel is the biggest power line of all time .... "Pack-at S * # t!" little like Clint's "make my day." And to see him slapping Sissy is the closest thing I will see to my fantasy of Julia Roberts like this ..... As I said, beautiful. 9/10
