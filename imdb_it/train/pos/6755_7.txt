Ah, noir. My favorite genre The sequel of Otto Preminger to "Laura" is a noir film set in post-war New York, where corruption and violence are rampant. Celebrate Dana Andrews in the role of Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics brought him into hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame the crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he is involved in the dead man's wife, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in typical noir style, things are quickly ruined. <br /> <br /> While the film does nothing interesting for the camera or fiction, it has a constant tone of terror and darkness. Like most great noir, it is also magnificent, which sucks the spectator from the start. <br /> <br /> Yet like most Preminger movies, it's not something I would watch again. The verbal intelligence of Wilder, the visual clarity of Hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of Welles is missing. Like Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" feels very "clone" of what a noir should be, instead of something truly artistic. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is nothing special. It is a policeman who slowly finds himself becoming a criminal. In one scene Dixon explains that his father was a little scammer, the film flirting with the notion of predestination, but this scene is as far away as Otto, or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> Even camera work is disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign the camera to something. It does not play with space or architecture, nor does it fill the procedural procedure of the police step by step. They are just tripods with occasional dollies inside and out. No sense, although many people don't care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is however a good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (noir cage) which in turn enters a vehicle (another cage) and is captured in the head of the gangster den. As Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto retopologizes the film, constantly compared "upstairs" to hell. It works well, but set design fails to strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems happy to follow the hawksian mold of what is a noir, rather than playing with the possibilities of where noir can go. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In A Lonely Place", "Act of Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is one of those well realized second level noirs. It is competent and appealing, but that extra special magic is missing.
