I am certainly happy that a film has been made about the extraordinary life story of Carl Brashear. Coming as during the era of Civil Rights, Brashear has become an inspiration for people of all minority groups who do not want to settle for an expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear as interpreted by Cuba Gooding, Jr. takes the example in the conduct of the life he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated the baseball and made him loyal to his character and his conduct. Like Brashear, Gooding knows he doesn't want the life of a sharecropper that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it really clear to get more out of life than he got. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II, the Navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an official's valet, the actual fighting parts are denied him. This is not good enough for Gooding to be a candidate to become a Navy diver. <br /> <br /> Once at the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding is thrown all over him, mainly by the incumbent Chief Petty Officer, Robert De Niro. DeNiro may have some advanced prejudices, but it is still a hero and one that can inspire if the racial gap can be overcome. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. Surely they come from different places, but when they know each other, both turn out to be Men Of Honor. <br /> <br /> Other good performances to note are Charlize Theron as the wife of DeNiro and Hal Holbrook as head of the diving school, a boy that the Navy would have liked to retire for reasons you will see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story of people with courage to save and ability to change.
