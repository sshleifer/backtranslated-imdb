'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to become literate and realize his potential. For Iris, it is finding the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, starting and stopping, before everyone has the skills and courage to trust each other completely and move forward. In this sense it offers us a good view of how life is often, so it is credible. Unlike other reviewers, I found the characters made consistent for the whole image. The supporting cast is also carefully chosen and adds a depth of character that the main characters add meaning to in support performances. All in all an excellent film. The best thing I get from it is Hope.
