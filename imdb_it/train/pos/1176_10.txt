First let me tell you that I didn't like the fact that The Rock won the title which is so gay. Then I feel Regal should have had his European title back, Jeff Hardy is a lousy champion. Rob Van Dam had the intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won. I'm glad that Storm and Christian are tag champs, the best thing was the Booker T and Big Show game in my opinion.
