The Human Tornado is a Blaxploitation film from the 70s featuring cabaret artist Rudy Ray Moore, perhaps his most captivating role to date. The film tells the story of Dolemite, an ugly bitch who puts himself on the wrong side of a white and racist sheriff sleeping with his wife. La Dolemite barely escapes, and goes to sunny California to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and the lady of the "ladies" of Dolemite) named Queen Bee. However, it seems that an owner of a rival nightclub with Mob connections is trying to fit into his racket, so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore showcases many different talents in this historical film, including strong dramatic skills, the mastery of Kung Fu, an impressive sung voice (provides two of the songs on the soundtrack), a touching and compassionate side with women a compelling general charisma and a keen sense of comic time. This film has it all, people: deep plot, explosive action, ridiculous comedies, beautiful women in difficulty, a final slamming ... what more could you ask for in a movie?
