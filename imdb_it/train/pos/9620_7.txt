There are so many "Hollywood" movies made now that are not just tortures to look at, but also that they have no connection with anyone's life, anything. Of course, films don't always have to have a profound meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still directors out there who are concerned with telling "human" stories. I don't want to reveal the premise of this brilliant film, however, the script is certainly one of the most complex and memorable I have ever seen in my life, and I too am a 32-year-old movie fan! Bug occupies the top ten of my list of favorites, which includes: On the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name a few. This "moving" film should also become one of your favorites, that is, if you have a heart!
