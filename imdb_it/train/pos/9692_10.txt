I don't know who could find fault with a film that is simply human and fun like this, with so many delights for your heart. I enjoyed every minute and I guessed the ending in the middle of the film - but they didn't disappoint me at all. Not only will it touch your heart, but it is such a beautiful film for the family - we need many more like these!
