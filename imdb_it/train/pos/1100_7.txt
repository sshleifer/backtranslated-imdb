- Having tired of the race for success and the cramped living conditions of New York, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a house proves to be anything but simple. As headaches and bills start to accumulate, so do laughter. Will Mr. Blanding ever have his dream house? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film so special are the three main actors: Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Each of the three is able to bring a movie alone, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been my favorite in this kind of role. He is so good at interpreting the husband put up. Loy is always a joy to watch. Thin Man's films made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two or three years. Douglas has also appeared in The Old Dark House, one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> - The film is definitely a product of its time. It gives me the impression of imagining a time when you could build a two-story house, three bedrooms and four bathrooms for an income of $ 15,000 a year. Do you think your two children attend private school and you have a maid and it becomes almost imaginative. <br /> <br /> - However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and difficulties Blanding find themselves in are easily related to today. And this is where the comedy comes into play. How many people have done some of the stupid things that the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is all the subplot "wife in love with the best friend". It is not really necessary for the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented.
