I would just like to say that, no matter how low the film budget is, it is necessary to show the meaning of these films worldwide. We don't read so much anymore, instead people want to see movies. Having this series on DVD made me want to read the entire series and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. Please don't change any of the characters, it will ruin the effect. Because I grew to love the actors who played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message and look at the message that these books and now the movies are here to portray. We can't get enough. AMAZING WORK!!!
