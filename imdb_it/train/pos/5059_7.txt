We saw the VCR and found it fascinating. Not knowing anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian (" red "Indian in the film), what a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film does a good job in demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and in undermining the racist myths that concern them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, what a beauty and very convincing as an Indian woman (I think she is French-Canadian, surely returns to the all too familiar discourse of this). Despite Brosnan's detached and grunt style, he eventually arrives convincingly as a passionate and dedicated man. The plot is a bit weak in demonstrating his trapper to animal conservation conversion. Good movie, highly recommended.
