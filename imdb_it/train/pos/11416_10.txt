An excellent family film ... gives a lot to think about ... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is fantastic - it's so ... true ... similar things could happen in everyone's life. And don't forget to act: it's just great! Look at Frankie and you will understand what I thought ... This photo is really not to be missed !!!
