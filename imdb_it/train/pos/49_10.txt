If you "get" it, it's great. <br /> <br /> If you don't, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean that you went through a school shoot. There is much more to this film than sometimes the school shooting becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> Above all, it is a film about the acceptance, both superficially, of a traumatic event, but also of people who are different for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> It is also a film about unbearable pain and how different people bear it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's anger and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that in the middle of the film we ask ourselves how the director can perhaps pull a happy ending out of his hat. Fortunately, the public is given credit for being human; our intelligence is not insulted by a saccharine, improbably moralistic ending. Beyond and beyond, I try to keep a clear mind that movies are fiction and everything else. Yet I must admit that I cried like a little child lost during this film. There were certain things that struck * very * close to home and opened old wounds that were never completely healed. But it's not necessarily a bad thing.
