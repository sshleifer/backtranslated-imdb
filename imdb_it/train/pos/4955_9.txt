I don't know why people always want a deeper meaning in movies or consider them worthless. <br /> <br /> How about being simply entertained? Something where Morgan Freeman excels. It has the possibility to show off a little. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to lure people into watching his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A little humor, a bit of pathos, a bit of bittersweet but nothing exaggerated. I received a special kick from Jim Parsons as a receptionist in a construction company. When he looks at Freeman and says: "You make me want to be a woman". It's simply fun. Even the fight scene between Mrs. Vega, her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a cute and charming movie that will make you smile. You could do much, much worse.
