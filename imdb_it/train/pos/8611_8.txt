I really enjoyed watching this movie. I recorded it while watching it so I could review it later. Actually, I really appreciated the second vision because I managed to absorb more of the brilliant dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the 2 main characters. I thought the way this story evolved was very inspiring. I was very intrigued by how Natalie would interact with her daughter's friends, at first it seemed like she was going to vomit up a lot of animosity, but once she started interacting in a more pleasant way I had to see how this visit would take place. I was not disappointed. Gradually the secrets that Sara kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, an imperfect human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a bully mother who thought she knew her daughter but who unfortunately he had to learn in a painful way that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them freedom. Viewers who have remained faithful to this film have seen a very touching performance by Diane Keaton (who is always wonderful, even in some of her less appreciated films - think City and Country). The final scene of Diane Keaton driving the house was worth the wait, revealing that anyone who loves another human being must learn that we must live our lives, love others but do not possess them and in the end we must let them go. It's a tough lesson, but it's worth contemplating from time to time. Thanks to CBS for this broadcast, it was worth the long wait.
