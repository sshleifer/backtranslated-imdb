I was a little afraid of seeing this film because of its rates. But living in Italy like this never meets and I love it so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance film I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just "winning". It is touching and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she's so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT (and what talent Rutina Wesley has, my jaw has fallen into the final dance scene). The way he pursues his dream and refuses to let something stop him is, honestly, inspiring. Furthermore, the fact that she is not the typical super hot girl (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really charming and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? You can tell in the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Really really good. I even cried at the end of the film. And the dance routines are simply sick.
