The basic plot here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry, in Ishwar's eyes his son Aditya can't do anything wrong, Aditya Sumitra's mother (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to take his son on the responsible path before it is too late, because Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and has only 9 months to live, when his son elipora and marries Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar forgives promptly Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali return from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, and this forces Ishwar to drive Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that her father suffers from lung cancer, and also he does not know his father threw him out of the tube to make him more responsible, Ishwar cannot take himself to Aditya who is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. it's a race against time, so Aditya does everything possible to prove herself to her father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets her big break in the film industry and her father tells him he's going to die. <br /> <This film is absolutely brilliant, this is the turning point in Indian cinema that was necessary for the Bollywood industry, Shah's direction is almost flawless, but which film has no flaws? The best part if this movie is the father child relationship which is a tear-jerker. the interluding song is just positioned at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the lines between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav jokes are too long and are annoying after a while, but overall this is a brilliant film, I recommend anyone to read this review to go and see it regardless of the other reviews. 9/10
