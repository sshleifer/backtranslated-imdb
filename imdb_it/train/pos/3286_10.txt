Put simply, this film is terrifying. <br /> <br /> Start simply, it looks like a studio of a rebellious girl and continues to become a wonderfully made horror film. <br /> <br /> Don't expect gore or zombies. This is psychological, and just like Candyman would do, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you realize what is happening, and how the two worlds of this movie connect. <br /> <br /> Designs have never been scarier.
