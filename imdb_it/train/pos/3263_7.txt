I normally like movies like "Chances Are", but I wasn't quite happy with it for a few reasons. The first half was well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and reincarnating into a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and her friend (Ryan O'Neal) and her daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes with them meet again and Downey rediscovering who he once was, they are well done, and there is a good dose of emotion and happiness when finally Shepherd believes his husband is really reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. There are several sex-related scenes that completely ruled me out, especially Downey and Shepherd who want to get together again despite the difference in their current age. After that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfactory way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I didn't expect the film to become so immoral at the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme from Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the film is not exceptional. For a better film like this, try "Heaven Can Wait". Decent, but I really wish I hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second part. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
