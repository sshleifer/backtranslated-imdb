Ghost Story, (The New House) is an incredible horror story. This is taken from the series Circle Of Fear and Ghost Story of the early seventies. The beginning and the end of each story are narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember it from the first family series, Family Affair in the 60s? This particular story sees Barbara Parkins and David Birney as main actors, and as the main characters in the story. I saw him recently and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not advise you to look at it. This story is formidable, without gorse words or curses, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband. Both actors were very good at their parts. If you like scary, funny and terrifying ghost stories, then you'll like this little gem. I gave a very high grade. I highly recommend this story.
