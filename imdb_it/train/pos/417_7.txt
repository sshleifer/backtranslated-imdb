This film has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the villain who sells weapons to Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next film was pretty much the same, but set at another time. This film begins with the assassination of Lincoln and also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay home. This film also covers Custer's last position and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and I usually don't like Jean Arthur, but I liked him here.
