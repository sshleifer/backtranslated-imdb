The Sopranos is perhaps the most open-minded series you could ever want to see. It's smart, it's bizarre, it's fun - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist the vision. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, set in the underworld of the New York criminal families. Most of the time, you don't really know if the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them for lunch. <br /> <br /> A further addition to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - These are dangerous men, many of them murderers, but from God if you don't love them too. I laughed at their jokes, I was torn when they made a mistake of judgment, and I was afraid of the pure and simple cruelty of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for the subtext of this show - people are not always what they seem, and the stark contrast between the monotonous and the actions performed by these seemingly petty criminals weighs up to the odds. <br /> <br /> If you haven't already done so, you should definitely do it.
