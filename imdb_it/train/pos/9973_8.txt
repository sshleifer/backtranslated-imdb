I really liked this version of "Vanishing Point" compared to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version rather boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times (like I did with the 1971 version) compared to me, it's not that good. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine years old when the 1971 version was published. However, I saw many remakes, in which I liked the original and an older one. I discovered that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and basically was true to the original without compromising the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more enthusiasm and was not so "blas√©" boring).
