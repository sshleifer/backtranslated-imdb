This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is simply fantastic! <br /> <br /> It is not an idealistic film, I would say that it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place. The characters are very nice but they also have some "dark" sides, what makes you believe they are real people. Great film with great actors to show that life is not always fun, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
