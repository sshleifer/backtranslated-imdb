I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so used to seeing it now in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon, as it will show Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. Since we saw it on Sabrina now for 5 years and then to give viewers a taste of his unused talent it would be an advantage. Melissa plays her role so well in this that her parents "finish" so she can be with the boy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice, Melissa works with David Lascher in this, long before she played the role of Josh in Sabrina. So it would be nice to see it at the time it is broadcast again. I hope MJH gets some good roles in movies or even other TV movies, kind of like Kellie Martin that has always shone in TV movies. A lot of unused talent waiting to burst when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, Melissa always shines !!!
