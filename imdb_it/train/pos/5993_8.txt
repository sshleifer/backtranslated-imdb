The Cure uses the voice above to create an intense mood. Although the VO represents all the lines of the film, it is not surprisingly surprising from the visual history. The use of multiple film titles adds a lot of plot to the plot. The choice of combining b & w and color worked well to improve jumps over time. The finish will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I especially liked the thrill of the film's suspense. Even the close-ups for the love scene are enchanting and reflect an eye of good taste. The piece is rather short but achieves a lot. The precise assembly really helps to show what a short film can do. Worth watching more than once!
