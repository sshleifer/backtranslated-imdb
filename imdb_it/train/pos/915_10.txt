All the talent that Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 films, I thought they were all an accident because his 4th Main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad. But I have to say that it was not an accident. This guy has talent and the way he made Vivah is simply brilliant. From the first scene it hits you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are fantastic. The chemistry between these two actors gives a glimpse of that between srk and kajol. As usual Alok Nath as the good and loving father is fantastic, so Anupam Kher. But it is a Shahid-Amrita film. Amrita looks good in most of the scenes, although Shahid seems a little young to get married, but does a good job with a shy but morally strong spouse. this film will be particularly appreciated by those who have lived such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all a brilliant film. hat to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
