This series was just as you'd expect from Mr. Spielberg. It's really one of those scary, funny, childish shows you won't forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show) this small series does what is not possible. It was nice, and deserved to run longer. It was a great show, that even children could see, even though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be, but everyone always had a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you understand what situation did not you wanted to end up in, or those you did. I remember seeing some of these on Sci-Fi when I was 10, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a fun and imaginative show. I loved it, and I still do it.
