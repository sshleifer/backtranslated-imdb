Actually, my vote is 7.5. However, the film was good, it has those fun parts that deserve to see it, they don't misunderstand me, it's not the funniest movie in the world, and it's not even original because it's an idea we've seen before in other movies, but this has its taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a movie for boyfriends ... I think not exactly, but who cares? There is also another film that shows us almost the same subject, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that is a very funny film, you see both if you want and I know you will agree that Mr . Rock won with his film. I would have liked the male character to have been given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.
