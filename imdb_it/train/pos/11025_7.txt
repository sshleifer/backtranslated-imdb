Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, admirable in making this film about an experienced mountaineer who is taken hostage by a friend of a gang of dangerous criminals in search of cases full of clothes money stolen from the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is as impressive as Gabe Walker, the experienced climber, especially in action / fight sequences, but some of them surely border on the unrealistic line. However, for the sake of the film, I am willing to suspend disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectable as secondary characters in the film. Action / combat sequences are well executed, but as mentioned above some are not very realistic, no matter how hard you are. However, the climbing sequences are very well done because instead of doing the entire film in a studio somewhere, the locations they chose turned out to be very real and Ariel's views on the mountain ranges are wonderful, adding a touch of reality to the movie. The deaths are inventive while others are predictable. The bad guys are solid, but it would have been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many. The pace of the film has been a bit slow, but the good beats the bad one in this. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, chances are you like it too. Overall, Cliffhanger has a character development with enough action, drama, suspense, excitement, thrills and good cast performances that make this movie worthy of the time to watch.
