I think you should be from the United States to get a lot of jokes. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. It is not possible to compare the quality of the shots with those obviously, but making the trip with the cameramen was obviously done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure the French wouldn't like the caricatures of the French. So this film is not for a global audience. And while I'm not a qualified film critic, I know what I like. I couldn't stop laughing for the whole movie. My sides and my jaws hurt at the end of the film.
