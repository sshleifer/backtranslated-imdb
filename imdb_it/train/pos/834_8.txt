Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How do you make a comedy for murder? It can be a risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values ​​and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. So the story is solid as a rock of a suspended reality to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irish answer to 007 is now launched as an alcoholic who smokes a cigarette and has sex addicts, killing people for a living and experiencing a life crisis. Meet a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start, he finds out he needs a friend. But Greg is happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have, love, home and a life. Add the character actor, Philip Baker Hall as manager of the killer and leave for the races. Brosnan is as wonderfully coarse and crude as the anti-hero and Kinnear as delightful as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a spark like Kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated by this derelict who drags herself into their lives. The finish is delicious and somewhat surprising. You should leave the theater feeling, at least in part, if you can suspend being amazed by killing people.
