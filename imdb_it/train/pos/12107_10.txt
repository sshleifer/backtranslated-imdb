I saw this film as a child on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a rather creepy movie, though not as beautiful as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it's different from what I remember because in the DVD I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and / or Italian and there are no subtitles. So the other actors respond in English to what is being said. Kinda weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some actors are written differently by IMDb. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this film is different in that the character of Elsie takes off her clothes and supplies a nude shot in a scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to take her out with her by pushing her onto the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very modified. I wonder if there are no extra movies that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra edition? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classics have been packaged and sold in all kinds of modified versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused movies? <br /> <br /> Apart from the boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the film is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia hit him is a good one). The disturbing atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele hadn't been in this movie, it would be a big zero. You make the film to ten!
