This film, which begins with an interesting opening of two hot blondes wearing it in the back of a moving driverless vehicle, has a rather strange personality to use. The cast of seven (even if a girl is not around for the bodycount, which is unlucky because the death toll is already so small) are all super hot, given that our story is centered around boys who party in the desert (one strange but effective choice of setting), which are hunted by a disturbing man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. Anticipate many of the vehicle-inspired slashes ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") in which the murderer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. The murderer himself is quite terrifying, and we find comfort in the extremely nice heroine of Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil murderer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all the white clothes, scarce and out of tune as might be). Director Bill Crain does some really cool things with his camera, some tricks on the screen and the cast tries his best. There is enough blood in the low number of people to satisfy cold-blooded fans, and enough T&A from a couple of girls to satisfy T&A fans. Overall, this film is highly undervalued and widely sought after worldwide. slasher movies, as it is rather rare to find it on video. Highly recommended.
