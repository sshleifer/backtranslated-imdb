Hooray! A space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come for the exciting journey that is the space field. The film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together in a shady soup. But when the going gets tough - the difficult ones are resolved and it's not a not credible change in the characters, because you can believe that there is a certain responsibility in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The only flaw The film is that Kate Capshaw is EXTREMELY annoyed as the instructor "I'm right and you're wrong". I would recommend it as a nice movie night and a vote of 7.
