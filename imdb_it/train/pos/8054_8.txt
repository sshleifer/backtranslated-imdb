"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts films I have had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese boy who comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of "Via del Drago". Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, so he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He strokes his nose with his thumb exactly as Bruce Lee does and also releases his shrill scream. Also use the nunchakus in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There is a great showdown towards the end of the film, which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to meet every opponent one by one. A bit like "The game of death", in which each fighter has a martial arts discipline different from one another. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching and even the very first Sammo Hung I movies I saw. Excellent fighting scenes and lots of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung movie that I highly recommend to all you martial arts fans. 8.5 / 10!
