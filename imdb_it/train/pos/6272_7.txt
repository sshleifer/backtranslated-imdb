<br /> <br /> I once saw No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it ok. The film is about a boy who only steals Porsche. Gone in Sixty Seconds arrives 13 years later and adds nothing. In fact, it has many scenes that are useless. And the finish is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been used better ...
