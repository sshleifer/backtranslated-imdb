IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so determined to be realistic, sometimes it's more clinical than fun. Recounting the brutal killings of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on the minutiae, enveloping himself and the reader in the subject AND subjects! Brooks walks away wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama. Even if he films in real places, he keeps his distance. The killers are portrayed as depraved fools, which they certainly were. They are not seen as misunderstood souls (as in the book of Capote) and the ferocity of their act is horribly obtuse. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent killers as is the supporting cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a reporter (the character of Capote?). The reference photograph is of the great Conrad Hall.
