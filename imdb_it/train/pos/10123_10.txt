Shinjuku Triad Society: It is unlikely that the Chinese mafia wars will be distributed in the West outside of film festivals. Why? Could your censors put a movie to sleep in which the cops violently rapes women and men suspected of convincing them to talk (and the victims have fun) or see an old lady get her eyes pulled from her skull? These are just some of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent story of cops and gangsters. Makes Clockwork Orange that has been banned for years in the UK looks like a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> Should you see this movie? YES It is a fantastic and essential vision for lovers of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what the visitors have in the world of these characters. If you like it, make sure you capture Dead or Alive which is very similar (obviously excluding the final DOA crowd). Great for Japan who have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance of seeing this film outside of a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD. If I didn't discourage you, try searching for a Hong Kong version on the web because I'm sure it will be released in that country.
