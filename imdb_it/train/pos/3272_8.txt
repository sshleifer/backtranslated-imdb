Coming from the same director who had made "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised it's a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a film I had never heard of before, yet it must be one of the best films of the late 1980s - partly because this is undoubtedly the worst period of films in recent decades . (We are not talking about the Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The acting is not brilliant, but simply solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamed of this "wonderful acting", just like Anna). The plot is an interesting fantasy that does not end in an intelligent way that perfectly links all aspects. These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose, leaving it to the interpretation of the individual, and there is nothing wrong with this with a theme like this. "Pepperhaus" is a rather unusual mix of children's movies and horror, with an effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not the typical clich√© ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant girl marginalized, but a normal normal boy; very refreshing. I'm sick of writers who project their maladjusted childhood in their books and on screens, as if someone cares more about watching or reading about another greedy and lonely childhood, as if it were all there or as if it were that type in the background of the characters holds the monopoly of good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy "snogging" (for a long time) was a bit too much - evoking feelings of vague disgust and amusement - considering that it should have been only 11, but predictably it was discovered that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was shot. I have no idea why they didn't improve the age of the character or get a younger actress. It was pretty obvious that Burke wasn't so young. Because filmmakers always throw older children than they play, so they dilute realism, I'll never know.
