Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films, one of those films that I think you appreciate most about your years. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I think the film was the biggest of his films at the time of its release. The characters have become more dimensional than the previous films, creating more depth to better appreciate the characters. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Disney characters ever created. With her kindness and a touch of dry humor, she is extremely nice; however, it is the inspiration that provides that makes it unforgettable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, and she stands up in her dreams, never giving up. Even in the most adverse situations, her dreams last, and she will not let anyone take her away from her. His example should serve as an inspiration for all and an encouragement to never let your dreams go.
