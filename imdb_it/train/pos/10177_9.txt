'De Grot' is a fantastic Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, "Het Gouden Ei" was transformed into the great Dutch thriller called "Spoorloos" ("The Vanishing") in 1988. This is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing ') but there are times when it is approaching. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening moments are fantastic. We see a man, we later learn that his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his luggage it is quite clear that he is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and performed. A kind of suspense is created that you normally wouldn't have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, stating that they have never done anything like that. <br /> <br /> From this point the film is constantly flashback and flash-forward. Let's see how Egon, still a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a boy named Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, how and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Meanwhile Egon goes to college and settles down with a woman. At this time he sometimes meets Axel but he really doesn't want to have anything to do with him. <br /> <br /> The film is chronological in a sense. Shows Egon and Axel as children, as students, young adults and around thirty-five. But from time to time, as I said, the film returns to when they were children and jumps forward again. Whenever we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Minor spoiler here. <br /> <br /> The title means "The Cave", and it is the cave this gives the film its happy ending, although in reality it is not so happy. Like the beginning, the ending is fantastic. The central part of the film is fun and in a sense it distracts our attention from the first scenes, to then return to that point at the end. It is the montage that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is also happy in a certain sense.
