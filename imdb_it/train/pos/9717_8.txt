How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is honestly one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It is not one of those "coarse" comedies that relies heavily on jokes and cabinet humor, but which instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the narrative that is unfolding. Simon Pegg nails him in the coffin with his hilarious portrait of a home run character and is quickly detaching from the tripod of which he once belonged in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Being at the top of the Hollywood food chain is a difficult thing to do, as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first hit in the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboy Run, but he received tepid reviews from critics and of the public. His second test is this film, he got quite positive reviews from the majority but it was a box office flop. I, for example, have not yet lost faith in him and will still be there whenever he wants to take that third blow for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters were well launched by Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst, in my opinion, has played this film as well as the love for the character of Pegg, however, the spark I saw in the Interview with the Vampire is still lost. He needs to find it, quickly or he could suffer the consequences of getting lost forever in the land of the "rom-com".
