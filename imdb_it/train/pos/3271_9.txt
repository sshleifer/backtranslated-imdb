I've always been a big fan of this movie, first of all you saw the cast, the acting is superb and you help make this movie move very well. Cybill Shepherd has received excellent reviews for her role, and they have been well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage of images, stops abruptly when her husband Louie unexpectedly dies. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot in life when he agrees to be "recycled" from the ground like the new Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live his new life by forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with her. But fate crosses the path of Alexs 23 years later when he meets Corinne Miranda's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and embarrassing situations occur.) music is great and the scenes are heartfelt and very nice. You will not be disappointed if you give it an opportunity, it is likely that you will like it. Very fun and sweet!
