Well, this movie is really hard. To be honest with you, this film does not contain a compelling story, nor does it make you want to know how it will end ... but I'll tell you something now ... I've never been tense and jumped up before in my life! This movie definitely guarantees jumps and chills! To be honest, I looked at it almost at midnight, so I was quite asleep anyway, so maybe that explains why I was nervous ... or maybe it's because this movie offers that look! It is basically a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move and rent a cabin in search of things in the mountains ... everything seems calm and calm until they have their first visitors (I think it's the main character's sister, and she brings her husband with her) .. . during the night, the husband hears noises ... he controls it, and this is when things start to go really bad ... they don't stay for another day and tell the couple that they should leave something wrong as soon as possible well ... long story short ... in the end they find out what happened in that house in the last few years and decide that it needs to be taken care of. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood blockbuster. Nore has a huge budget, but please don't be put off. It's creepy, tense and very very nervous! Just give it a try :)
