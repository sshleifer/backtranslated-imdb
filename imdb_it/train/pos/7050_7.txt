I don't want to spend a lot of time here hanging out on the plot: you've seen the trailer and if you don't have it online. I don't recommend seeing it though - it was badly done and didn't pack any of the film's laughter or magic. So those who avoid this movie because of its bad trailer should give it a chance. It's really funny. I was amazed by the intelligence and originality of this film. The first 40 minutes put me on the floor in hysterics - my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad Austin Powers movie in the last 20. This, however, is one of the few movies where the campy ending doesn't it displeased the rest of the film (which is normally the case). Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments. Personally, I'm going to see it again when it comes out, just to get all the details I was laughing at the first time!
