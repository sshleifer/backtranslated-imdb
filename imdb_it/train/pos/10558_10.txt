<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman made the strange metaphysical anxiety strange, but this Canadian gem makes it hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most bizarre movies, the less we talk about the plot the better, but we stage, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, can't face the world and in the end this means that they have no longer. But that's where other problems start. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile a lot after the credits and this is a rare experience with so many mass-produced "nothing" pieces out there. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. <br /> <br />
