This film has great fighting scenes. Now it's true that acting is a bit harsh. But if I wanted to see a film based on acting skills, I'd watch a cheese movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts in it and with incredible stunts WITHOUT the use of wires and flying it throws the air like so many movies around now that they're killing the matrix. So look at this. Now it is true that the two main stars of the show in which the child shows the power rangers and another cast member of this show has a bit of a part in this film. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li put on his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit thrown in and admire.
