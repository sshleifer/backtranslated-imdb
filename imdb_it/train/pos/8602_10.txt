It was said, regarding Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe that the same observation could be adapted to the images of McDonald-Eddy. And above all this. <br /> <br /> Apparently it has many features of a failed film: it is kitsch, the script, because of the censorship, sounds incoherent ?? Still, this film also gets good points: the good music of Rodgers-Hart ("I married an angel", "Tira tira pull la"), good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> However, if you don't like it, you can't forget it. This strange film actually leaves a very strong, dreamlike impression, and most likely we will keep it in mind for days, maybe weeks. Why? In the 1930s and early 1940s, films did not have the same meaning as today: as a dream, they aimed to divert the public to make people forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream films made, at that time, this is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> In short, we say that the best way to appreciate this film is to look at it without being surprised if it is good or bad. Look at it, as if you were looking at a dream.
