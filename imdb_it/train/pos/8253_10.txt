This is the first movie to see I've seen in the last year! It's incredibly fun, incredibly original, incredibly beautiful (they opted for this super cool Technicolor screen that is fantastic to see) and actually has a deep character and what it says about the company. It is a truly intelligent satire that nails everything from Homeland Security to running problems, while at the same time letting you laugh and realize how the world lives in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comic performance that I never imagined would come from her! It's sweet, fun and sexy! Billy Connolly is as big as Fido who can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as a dad is priceless. In fact the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad boy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the sexy sexy zombie girl (getting the idea now?) Funny, even if provocative and just amazing! Go and watch this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
