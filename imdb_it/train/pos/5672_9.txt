In this installment of the series, Edmund Blackadder is blocked in the period of the Regency in Great Britain (during the later part of the rule of George III). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer: in place of the royal family, he is a servant of the very, very often George IV (the regent of prices). Unlike the historical accounts of George IV, this is as bright as a tomato and, consequently, Blackadder is able to take advantage of him and design the content of his heart. The only big difference in style between this and the previous ones is that the series ends with a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. Besides this, all the usual elements of history are there and the show is exhilarating. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not appropriate for children because of its vulgar language and adult situations.
