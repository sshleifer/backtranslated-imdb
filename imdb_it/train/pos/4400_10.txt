The protagonist of this film is the script. The attention to detail for the period in dress, language, social customs (we do not hurt women) and politics are considerable. Today it is a memory of Kosovo. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for a careful observer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Perhaps this film is close to the marrow of reality to gain the support it should have received. It is like a scale of increasing violence with well balanced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. A great movie ....
