Nothing revolutionary here; just an impeccably elegant and sober cinema. <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a squalid police station, and mainly to an interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film QUESTA DOLCE MALA, among others) intercalate glimpses of external paintings as minimalist local settings. Miller's moderation, especially at the beginning, is breathtaking, and his exquisite mastery of the consequent fundamental internal staging - makes the vision appealing. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is superb as usual, managing to legitimize a character, on paper, is clich√©: the laconic murderous detective, with a hard nose, tired of the world. Ventura lives the role, making it completely credible, even if the script allows us limited access to its inner functioning; the film ends just when it seems to be forced to confront its failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is up to the task as the suspected child murderer who sparsely adorns the single flicato. The exchanges between the two are more than ever fraught with tension and the aura of a playing field in constant metamorphosis for a battle of wits. Serrault's character is in turn deplorably haughty and astute, and pitiful; then later .... <br /> <br /> The "message" of GARDE A VUE, if he were to look for one, is a condemnation of the methodology of the police and the kind of pressures that make a policeman too eager, if necessary , close cases at the expense of justice. For most of its length, however, the film is nothing more than an example of how to transform a potentially soporific scenario into a suspenseful drama of the highest cinematic economy. <br /> <br />
