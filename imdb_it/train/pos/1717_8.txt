The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol) - who is a witness of professional marriage, in short he acts as a witness for couples in the marriage registration office - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) who ran away from his home in Nainital to get married with her love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha waiting for the wedding registration office because Dhiraj shows up, but for some reason she doesn't show up. So Ankush arrives here in the photo, which had approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs. 200 for his work as a Witness and he ends up helping her by providing a shelter for her. Ankush grows on his side working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Megha and she also falls in love with him (or the kind of love), both agree to the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the picture. The unexpected circumstances happen, in reality I should say, the expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then .... <br /> <br /> Actually the story of the film is slightly different from the movies we see and I don't think it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie fanatic like me and you love watching something different, then you will surely like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story written very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that it seems like things are happening to the boy next door. Even the background music of the film plays a very good role, it is simply too beautiful. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a feeling of freshness. <br /> <br /> so let's figure it out and summarize it. <br /> <br /> History: a very common story carried very well and turned into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, as was the creation of Himesh Reshammiya, so I didn't expect much, but I still liked a couple of songs from the movie including Qawwali. <br /> Acting: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent acting, but she should stay away from singing in songs. Soha Ali Khan, it's a doll, a very pretty doll I have to say. Again a very innocent and natural acting and these two actors fit their characters perfectly. In addition to these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and can be a few layers of fat to cover the bones. The other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also like to give it 3.5 stars out of 5. You will like the movie if you watch it in the theater, I would advise you to watch it in the theater if you are a Movie Mania and accept unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to arrive. The film will certainly not be appreciated by the masses and the business it can do is by advertising word of mouth.
