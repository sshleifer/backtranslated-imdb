Charming doesn't even begin to describe "Saving Grace;" it is absolutely irresistible! All those who venture into this film will leave with their high spirit (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are going to get much worse. His dear departure left her without money and without debts. In the face of losing everything, he must find a way to get a lot of money ... fast! He has an idea when his gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson), asks the famous horticulturist to advise him on a plant that is growing secretly. Grace immediately realizes that her plant is marijuana, so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow lots of high quality grass and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> The most notable quality about "Saving Grace" is its liking. Each character is extremely sympathetic and, apart from the first 20 minutes or so, the film is in good spirits without pause. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities. <br /> <br /> Acting is top notch. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best British actresses, and here's why. It transforms what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual. She is a good lady, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson is equally amiable as Matthew. He's a lifeless loser, but he's so nice that it doesn't matter. Even the rest of the ensemble cast fits into this category, but a special mention goes to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has an aura of threat on him, and this fits him well, but he also has great comic skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Saving Grace". It's all about charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be depleted by the film. It is not so here. The film is very nice and always fun. This does not mean that "Saving Grace" is just a nice movie that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. Although this film is not a real comedy, it boasts two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with the film, it's that the climax is a bit confusing. However, the questions are answered and the ending has an unexpected turn. <br /> <br /> See "Saving Grace", especially when you have a bad day.
