as a habit I always like to read the reviews of "hated" of each film. especially one that I would like to comment on. and it is not so much a counterpoint-like affair; I just like to see what people say in the background. <br /> <br /> however, I want to tackle one thing. many people who hated him called him, to paraphrase, "beautiful, but superficial", some even went so far as to say that the desire for the norm and yet the inability to help his brother was a trivial plot, at best. <br /> <br /> I'd like to disagree. <br /> <br /> as a brother of a brother who has a similar dysfunction, I can identify him. every day, you see them abusing themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it is not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why paolo decided to undertake gambling and to associate with questionable people; it's really more like they are wired. on the one hand, they are real geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (it is very similar to people like Howard Hughes, the same forces that drive them are the same forces that separate them) and for as long as you see this, you know, and what's worse, you realize you can't do a damn thing. <br /> <br /> for norman maclean, a river running through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to happen and who was to blame. in the end, nobody is, and often, there is no reason. but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly achieve this realization. sometimes it takes a life. and sometimes it never comes.
