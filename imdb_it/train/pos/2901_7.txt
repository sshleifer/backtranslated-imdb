Tiempo de Valientes fits perfectly into the genre of the action film, but transcends its roots thanks to the excellent casting, the tremendous relationship between its protagonists and the extraordinary photography. Diego Peretti plays the role of Dr. Silverstein, a shrink assigned to lead the rifle with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who was commissioned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods that appear to have been involved in a smuggling conspiracy of weapons. Diaz has been suspended from service, but she is the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help to be reinstated. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves entangled in a conspiracy involving the Argentine intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive investigative skills. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer screen team, although Peretti is not as nice as Hill. Surprisingly, even almost two hours late, Tiempo de Valientes does not tire of his welcome, and in fact the writer and director Damian Szifron has created a potential sequel in the fascinating queue of the film. All in all, a wonderful and very funny action comedy that neither supports the common denominator nor offends your intelligence.
