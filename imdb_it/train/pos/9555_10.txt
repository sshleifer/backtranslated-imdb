I saw this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they were showing this film as a double film with Tom Jones (1963). Since then I have not seen this movie on TV. I had an interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, like Lusty the sailor. I think Dale is now narrating the Harry Potter books on Casette, but it's pretty funny anyway. This is a quick comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through its movie collection and consider the possibility of restoring and publishing this film on DVD. Christopher Plummer is as exhilarating as Lord Fopington, even Ian Bannen is quite funny as Ramble the sailor. This is an obscene comedy, the kind of film that is no longer seen, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars on ****
