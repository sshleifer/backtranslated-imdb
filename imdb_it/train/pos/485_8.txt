"The Luzhin Defense" is a good film with excellent central performance, but it comes from too much novel stuff and not enough. It was through most of the film that the characters helped push the narrative. Marlene Gorris might have been able to examine Luzhin's psyche, rather than depict him as a tortured innocent victim, torn apart by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adapting screen literature is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written at the beginning of the 20th century. This film does not go far enough into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's split with her mother comes up against a hasty disagreement with her mother rather than a dramatic flash point in the film. I felt I had been subjected to Luzhin's torment and his tragic end, without being given the pleasure of discovering his unusual and complex personality. However, this was a moving and amusing film but certainly not exceptional.
