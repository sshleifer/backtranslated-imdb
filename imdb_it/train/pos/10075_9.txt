"Maschere" is a moving film that works on many levels. In the simplest way, it is the disturbing story of a street artist who ties himself to a child as he tries to convey his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although, sometimes the story makes the old man a job, it's so well done (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it's easy to go beyond his situation. And, if one hangs it, the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Congratulations all around. This is a wonderful film for children and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who might not like foreign language films to see it!
