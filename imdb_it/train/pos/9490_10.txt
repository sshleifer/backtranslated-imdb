The first time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but now reviewed this thriller is still current. Some more recent films focus on similar subjects, but do not correspond to this French goal. <br /> <br /> A president - obviously JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public appearance. The enormous investigation that results has found guilty the figure of "Lee Harvey Oswald" of this film, but a member of the jury insists on further investigations. Reveals some surprising evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a film with the same storyline - this doesn't play with emotions, but focuses on an exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything harmonizes, drawing a new image of murder. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK this film is more reasonable, intelligent and exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in many recent films, sometimes I had a kind of deja vu sitting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comare Icare" is a "must see". It's unique and brilliant, and Ennio Morricone's music is wonderful. This film deserves a very good ranking, if it were a Hollywood production it would certainly be famous. <br /> <br />
