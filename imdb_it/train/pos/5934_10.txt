I'm sorry to say that I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Of course give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, speaking of Hollywood, I think they can cover the plot in the Batman movie, but please don't entertain us what we really want to see together Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because it left me looking for something else. I was looking around to see when he was leaving. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics in which the plot looked good and had all the features of a great movie. Unfortunately it won't happen for now. For the producers, the directors and all the actors a great job, but I hate you for doing this. You let me want more.
