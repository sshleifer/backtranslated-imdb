Atlantis was much better than I expected. In a sense, it had a better history than the other films destined for a higher age. Although this film has required solid attention at times. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the young people expected a comedy, but they had an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have seen nothing but parodies. After a short time, everyone seemed to be watching Atlantis intensely.
