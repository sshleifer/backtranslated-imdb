A warm and touching film that has a fantastic quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but there is only something about it that will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> Above all, you have to see this fantastic 5-year old. old man, Jodelle Ferland. I was so fascinated by his presence, I had to buy the film to be able to see it again and again. It's a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by IMDB's high rating, I'm not the only one hypnotized by this young actress.
