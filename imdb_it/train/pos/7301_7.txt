When I heard about "Hammerhead" on DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another cheap Nu Image movie". Those guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have produced inexpensive but very entertaining B - Pictures in recent months but also very disappointing movies. So I didn't expect much, especially after seeing the rather disappointing "Shark Zone" just a few days before. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent revival of the monster movies of the 1950s. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, man-eating plants and, of course, we have the creature, a huge mix of mutants between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for a fun monster movie. The only thing missing is the graphic sex scenes and the nudity that you expect in films of this type, but since the film was made for TV it is understandable why these scenes are missing. And it doesn't matter anyway because "Hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at its best. There are two reasons why I gave seven out of ten points, though: First of all, the monster is not seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and badly done, and secondly, William Forsythe just does not is the right guy for the "hero" part and to fall in love with the wonderful Hunter Tylo. In addition to this, I highly recommend this movie to all monster movie fans. Grab a cold drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
