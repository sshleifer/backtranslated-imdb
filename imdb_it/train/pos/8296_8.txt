Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the small family moves, since the father has a new job in a computer company. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without her husband, as it certainly contains secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but the pressure is on him to unite, like all those who are something in the neighborhood and at work are members. The part of the good boy of Robert Urich is a little lukewarm, but Joanna Cassidy is a good-natured housewife who is playing tricks. A suspenseful, well-made cooler with a whore Susan Lucci as club president. Look for the cult cult Michael Berryman in a while as a waiter. The film captures the sense of paranoia and the final special effects deserve to be seen. I've seen this movie several times.
