The world is made up of two different types of viewers ... There are the "English Patients" types, who cannot be bothered to enjoy anything that is not high enough to be shown on PBS, and there are the "Happy Gilmore "guys, for which an hour and a half of genital games are definitely worth the $ 7. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are a lot of gray areas, but you know which way you're leaning. If you are an English patient, save time, save and save all your comments "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid." I know, you really enjoy diminishing every movie you don't like and every person you like, but maybe you could resist it just once. <br /> <br /> But if you're a Happy Gilmore type. .. go see this ... you will find it hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be fun in almost everything he does. Go take a look. You'll be glad you did. Alright then.
