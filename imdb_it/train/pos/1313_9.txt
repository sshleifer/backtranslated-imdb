Other TV movies should be made like this. I saw him back in '93 when he was the first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both fantastic, giving very realistic and realistic shows. Weber was particularly good at transforming an exceptionally creepy and sober performance like the child molester / murderer. This movie really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was somehow both formulated and exciting. But the direction in both these works has the same simple and simple realism that is so attractive. If you like TV movies that are not predictable and full of overacting, see if you can. Even the story beside the story of Hunt and Fahey is attractive without detracting from the main plot.
