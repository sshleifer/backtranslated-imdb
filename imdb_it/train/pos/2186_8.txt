and what a combination. Two great singers of the century are the protagonists of this underrated musical. He writes music, writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone who can't even write because his wife is dead (actually she just got fat!). The best scene is the pawnshop number where Bing sings an extemporaneous number while the swivel band removes the instruments from the hock. Just wonderful. And this is a rare starring role for the Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again the manic pianist), Charles Lane and co-star Helen Bertram. And who knew Rathbone could be fun?
