This is one of my favorite family movies. I really enjoyed it when I was a little girl and still resisting me now that I'm older. I still laugh at the same old jokes and could even shed tears sometimes. I never cared much about animals that spoke, or at least about those animated by the UN, but I defend this. It is a rather old film but it will always remain a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other films of live animals that I can think of at the moment when I could even confront myself, let alone like it as much as this. I could praise this movie too much, but I don't think show. I really have the great message that "The house is where the heart is". Or at least that's the message I gained from it. Definitely recommended for a good night of old family movies.
