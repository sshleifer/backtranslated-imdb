Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best in a series of horror films set in prison (such as "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 1980s. Twenty years earlier, guard Lane Smith unjustly executed a convict. Now he is the guardian of the newly reopened prison, and the man's ghost has returned for a bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very moody film is characterized by a lot of macabre horror and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are for fun carnage.
