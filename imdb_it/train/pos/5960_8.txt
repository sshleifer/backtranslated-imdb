It's nice to see Jorja Fox in a role where he can smile a lot. I also enjoyed listening to her singing. Nice change in seeing her get out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was fun, but it seemed to skip some explanation in many parts. Many of the characters seemed to be miserable for a minute and happy the next and it was left to your imagination to understand why. Each character was eccentric and, in some cases, I couldn't wait to see what they would do next or to hear what they would say later. This film was not full of clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad for them and then find a way to solve them.
