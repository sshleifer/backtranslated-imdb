This would have been a lot of fun to see in a theater, in 1996. There is a corner of pleasure guilty of my cinematographic taste that really appreciates the really good shocking films. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is an overview sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings about dental matters. Perhaps the ADA has launched a campaign against it, since dentists report having to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only one scene comparable to many in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It is surprising to note that, according to the trivia page, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, post production can take longer than filming and the editing of "The Dentist" is perfect. The rapid cuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "takes care" of his wife there are only two quick cuts that show what is happening. The rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has a lot of experience playing characters psychologically "out" and has completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me the rhythm of the film was just right. The directors reveal the wickedness of the wife in the right way. All the characters in the dental office seem to be real people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension when it comes to impatient people awaiting the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is on the tip of a huge psychotic break! Unlike so many films of this genre, the script is very narrow. All victims fall into the dentist's trap in highly calculated ways. Two types of law enforcement agencies are also involved in a small subplot that ends up creating a shock of a showdown towards the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the faint of heart or dental phobic but a real roller coaster ride and strongly recommended for intelligent gorefest enthusiasts.
