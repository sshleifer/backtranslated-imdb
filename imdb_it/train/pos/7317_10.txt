This was a film I had heard of my whole life growing up, but I had never seen it until a few years ago. His reputation really brought him. I knew Michael Myers, I saw the mask, I saw advertisements for all the bad sequels that followed. But I was growing up during the decade that Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and I had never thought much about the Halloween series. Guys, how they tricked me with magic shots. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly terrifying film. Now, by today's standards, it is not so graphic and visceral, but this film offers all the other levels that most horror films can't get today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so disturbing and the fact that it is set in a picturesque Mid-West city is a testament to his abilities. The light effects are really terrifying, with "The Shape" apparently appearing and disappearing in the shadows at will. The simple but brutally effective soundtrack only adds to the suspense. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well done, with explicit hints to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so nice and vulnerable. It is even more terrifying when she is haunted by Michael Myers because the director and the viewer have invested so much in her, we want her to survive and go away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis as a man on a mission, and it works well. It adds a sense of urgency to the situation in which the city finds itself because it knows what evil is pursuing its streets. <br /> <br /> Overall, not only is Halloween a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and attracts the public and never leaves. This should be the standard vision for anyone who wants to experience a truly scary movie. And for an even scarier time, try looking at it yourself with the lights off. Don't be surprised if you think you see "The Shape" lurking in the shadows!
