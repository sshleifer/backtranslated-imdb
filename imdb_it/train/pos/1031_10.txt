This series is set a year after the Abydos mission in the movie Stargate. It explains many of the things the film has neglected to mention. For example, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where does the Goa'uld (the race of Ra) come from? How many are there? <br /> <br /> The first episode has a retired Jack O'Neill (written with 2 Ls) called into active service by General George Hammond due to an attack by Stargate by Apophis, a powerful Goa uld who killed four men and kidnapped a woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims she should have crossed the Stargate for the first time, and is determined to do so now. We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that can be dialed. So Daniel's wife is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> Continues in the second episode in which General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jack's team will be the SG-1 composed of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a Goa'uld homeworld to save Daniel's wife and another captured in Abydos named Ska'ra. They are captured and, just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Teal'c, First First of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is part of the SG-1 . <br /> <br /> That was just the beginning of the adventure. During the show they moved on to the past and to the future, transported into alternate realities, exchanged bodies, aged, encountered alien races that include a rebel Goa'uld alliance called Tok'ra, in which Samantha's father becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little breed in which we see Thor more often (he is Jack's companion), and avoids the global disaster for the skin of their teeth countless times. <br /> <br /> The show was recently canceled, but it lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy called Ori came showing off new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients. The nine and nine seasons also saw the introduction of two new characters, Ben Browder such as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a human female from another world that brings new meaning fun for the team. <br /> <br /> Very well made characters, interesting, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this has it all. A different way of traveling in the galaxy and different types of adventures, this is a show not to be missed. Unlock the gate and cross it. You will not regret!
