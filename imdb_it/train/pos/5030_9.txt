Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It wasn't the same old recycled shit that comes out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I didn't even know it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you won't regret it. The suspense develops everywhere and the end of the twist is excellent. <br /> <br />
