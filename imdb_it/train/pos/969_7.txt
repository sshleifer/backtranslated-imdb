Miike makes an adventure film for children, not unlike The Neverending Story. It is actually one of my favorites among the director's films. Even the worst Miike is better than most movies, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that is worth recommending. It's at least as loud and hateful as most American movies are. I might think that the kids themselves would find it very pleasurable (the DVD includes a dubbing in English), but, like all of Miike's films, it may tend to move very slowly. This means that you have a sort of strange irregularity, where sometimes there is a noisy action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as the characters converse. The story itself is not very good, and Miike's perpetual incoherence defect lifts its ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. This must be Miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. The "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and are available in all the different fantastic forms, and the costume designers, the special effects team and all the others involved in the projects have done an exceptional job. I saw the 1968 movie it is supposed to be based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the rubber costume monsters that can be found there have been turned into more believable entities using the make-up and state-of-the-art special effects . I particularly liked the look of one of the villains (or girls, in this case), Agi, who wears dark eyeshadow, a white tight suit, a white hairstyle with beehive and a whip. He played, incidentally, Chiaki Kuriyama, which you could remember as Lucy Liu's daughter in Kill Bill: Vol. No. 1. The hero of the film is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who provided the voices for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
