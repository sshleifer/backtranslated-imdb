I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise form an exceptional pair. This movie is really fun and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You can't keep a good dog down" and that song about sharing, I think it's called "What is mine is yours". This was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find Itchy's voice to be so fun to listen to. Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares me to death. Other characters like King Gator seemed really funny to me. The ending was lovely and it was really sad, it made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
