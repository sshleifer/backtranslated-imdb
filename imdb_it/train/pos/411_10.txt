This film is well done on so many levels that I am surprised that the score is low (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at the time of writing). This film has incredible special effects, a real epic storyline, a complex interaction between characters and mind-blowing battles - they must be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I received (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I simply don't understand when I read and listen from various sources: "it has a confusing plot ...", "I couldn't follow the story ..." or "The characters came from nowhere ... ". From the first time I saw this film, I understood it, I followed it, I knew why the characters were there, and I loved it! I've seen it about 8 times and it's fun every time. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I showed this film to many American colleagues (people who have never seen a Hong Kong film before) who feel the same way. None of them failed to follow the plot and each person declared his love for this film. Oh man, why can't we have things like this come out of Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a pleasant combination of special effects, character development and plot. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even come from a beginner in Asian cinema. I own a large library of Asian films and I must say that this film is one of my biggest DVDs. When you look at it you will be amazed by the extraordinary special effects and the epic atmosphere of this movie. You will be drawn to this fantastic world and you will not want to leave! I saw both the 1983 and 2001 versions (both made by Tsui Hark), and 2001 is far better in IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to the subtitles, I have an additional complaint about this film: I didn't want it to end ... I beg you Mr. Hark - can we have a sequel please?
