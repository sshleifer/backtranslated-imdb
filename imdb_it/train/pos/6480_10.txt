This was by far the best war documentary ever made. From the beginning of the first episode, when Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrific events of Oradour-Sur-Glane "The day the soldiers came". In the last days of the war, when the mushroom clouds appeared on Japan, I never lost a second of this classic series and I remember it well even though it was shown back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. The entire series should be seen as mandatory for as many children as possible in the world, so that the tragedy of the Second World War does not happen again and that fanaticism, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
