Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was not convincing. Garrison's relationship with the First Lady was unreal and passionless; the president was a card. And who were the real villains anyway? Nothing has been developed or explained sufficiently. I still don't know why they wanted to kill the President or how the mole was involved. The bad guys were unnamed and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story: the chase and the fight were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both incredible in their roles, Basinger was totally devoid of character and in no way could Longoria be a secret service agent. This may have been a great movie, but somehow it missed the road, with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing overall despite some very nice scenes. And did they use the "West Wing" set for the White House scenes? - I waited for CJ or Charlie to appear!
