I saw the German version of the film on German television and I was really surprised. Generally I like to see documentaries, but I don't remember seeing one better than "Terra". I knew some YouTube video scenes that I found through random browsing. I also remember seeing parts of the film on multimedia stores, which run on the high-definition televisions displayed. After seeing the movie, it's obvious to me why the movie is so popular with YouTube users and multimedia retail managers: it's so fantastic and spectacular that you can't help but look on the screen, no matter if you are generally interested in documentary nature or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitating a 10 out of 10. Certainly, there are more electrifying films, but as for the documentaries, "Earth" is certainly one of the best of its kind.
