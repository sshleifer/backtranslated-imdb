A rather unpleasant affair that sees Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes, an assistant like Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (it sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol). Brides (why them? Who knows?) So that his wife can continue to look beautiful, he takes the brides after doing a fairly clever trick with some orchids that make the brides fall to the altar.After another bride she bites the dust, a journalist IT HAPPENS simply to be around for the scoop, and decides to browse around for a story. He finds all sorts of clues about orchids and the Lugosi. Gio knows where the police were. Soon he leaves for the den of Bela, when he meets a kind of a strange looking doctor who may or may not be an eeeevil, everything accumulates in a totally unlikely plan to have a fake marriage to capture the mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has a ray vision x, while belittling his plans, Oh no! What's going to happen? I really liked this movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is fantastic here, his hangers are all very very strange, the story is actually quite ugly in some places which makes everything more watchable. A fun little sight.
