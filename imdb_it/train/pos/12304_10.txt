this is a great movie. I like where ning climbs to get his ink, and the skeletons chase him, but fortunately he dodged them, opened the window and didn't even notice them. xiao qian is also very nice. and when he put the needle on Wu's butt, he is hysterical. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth while lying between two swords it is also beautiful. then also the part where he eats his sandwiches while watching the boy kill many people. then you see him singing poems as he runs to escape the wolves. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together. add the comic tenses, the giant tongue and you have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention superb special effects for the 1990s.
