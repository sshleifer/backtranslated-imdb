A lot about love and life can be learned by looking at the people of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch had another silent triumph added to his merit with this adorable film. With a sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and the wonderful performances of a cast of highly talented artists, he created a truly memorable film. Always believing in playing the intelligence of his viewers, and fostering sophistication on slapstick, the director invented a glittering cinematic meal spiced up with that elusive and enigmatic quality known as the "Lubitsch" touch. <br /> <br /> Even if the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this has no consequences. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any large American city or small city could easily be the place for action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are as wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so cleverly managed as to seem completely natural - perfectly conveys their confusion and tranquil despair as they search for soul mates. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of cinema. Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself a cuckold. A skilled thief of scenes, he does not allow any emotion to escape the invented. Furthermore, Morgan provides the film with his most joyful moments - almost at the end - when he determines that the last employee of his shop, an impoverished young man, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid representation to his list of screen portraits, this time that of a sannipanical and sannipian Lothario that completely deserves punishment eventually turned to him. Dear Felix Bressart has his best film role as a family man who cannot afford to get involved in store intrigue, but remains a constant friend to Stewart. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden appreciates the small role of a salesman. William Tracy is as exhilarating as the ambitious deliveryman who takes advantage of unexpected developments to leverage the sales force. <br /> <br /> In small roles, Charles Halton plays a no-frills detective and Edwin Maxwell appears pompous as a doctor. Movie stars will recognize Mary Carr and Mabel Colcord - both unaccredited - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother and aunt.
