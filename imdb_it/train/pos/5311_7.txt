The most accessible film by John Waters to date is one of his best, considering that it reduces all the campiness and the real vulgarity that seem to waste most of his previous work. Of course, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a way <br /> <br /> that cannot be considered too disgusting or disgusting. Due to some great casting choices, this film highlighted the stupidity associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and a bit carefree (if possible for Waters), this is one of those movies I would watch on a rainy day.
