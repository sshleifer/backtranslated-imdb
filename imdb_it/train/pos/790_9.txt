Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star, even if he keeps his pants on. <br /> <br /> The film has torn my heart by reminding me of the intensity of the great explosive love of my life. I don't think I can think of another film, except perhaps Romeo and Juliet by Zeffirelli that captures that dizzying joy so well. <br /> <br /> The other extraction of the film are the very English eccentric characters who enjoy the scandal indirectly. In this sense it is more or less the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or Miss Marple, without chaos. <br /> <br /> This is a great antidote to the fake horror currently popular in the United States and to relationships between people of different ages.
