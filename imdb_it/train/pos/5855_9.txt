If you've played "Spider-Man" in the PS version, you've seen it all. To really experience it you should get the DC version. In short, it is a graphically superior game; the textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate and have a much better sound than the cousin PS. I bought this game in the late '00s and it continues to hold up today. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a very superior and strategic game, but if you are a fan of 'or Web Head then you have to do it for your game library yourself. Traveling around the city like Spidey has never seemed so beautiful and perfect in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, take it for a low price. The DC version is simply amazing.
