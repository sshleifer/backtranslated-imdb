This is a great movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I am not the only one to shed tears. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, made the ending felt and memorable. In the hands of a minor actress, her last scene would have seemed banal and banal. One could never imagine that this film was made on a limited and limited budget. Cinematography is wonderful and there are many famous actors. The script is so wonderful, I can understand why everyone wanted to be there. If you look at the long list of credits at the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii has come to make this movie come true, and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and creates the atmosphere for the whole film. My only "complaint" is that I almost didn't want the movie to end.
