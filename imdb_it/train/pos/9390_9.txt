This film started me with a Nick Cage kick. It is a story full of twists, a film of motivation and moves. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a priest, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect couple to capture the unsuspecting man who fell into their net. Everything about this film is good - cinematography, the rhythm of history and above all the end. Cage excels in what he does best - he is not an action hero, but an ordinary man trapped in the dangers of life.
