Panning then by critics but loved by fans, this film has now become a classic. Mixing alleged "surreal" movies shot at John Lennon's home, among other places with live footage of Marc Bolan and T.Rex at their best, this film is not only a must for everyone who likes Marc Bolan but offers a vision fascinating of the era. <br /> <br /> Those were the times when Marc was hanging in the balance with the likes of Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who directed him] and you can even find a brief point from a Reg Dwight bang [Elton John a you] ivories in an amazing version [and never officially published] by Tutti Frutti and the rock and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes with Chelita Secunda [who is said to have created glam rock] with her use of glitter etc., Mickey Finn and even the Catweazle actor !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining table, sits cross-legged in front of a string section and clears acoustic versions of classics like Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly, highly recommended !! FIVE stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
