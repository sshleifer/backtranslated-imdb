This film is incredibly underestimated by IMDb. Like so many movies, this is not Shawshank. But it is a reasonably good, predictable, dance / personal growth competition. If you want to spend an hour and a half looking at a sort of 8 Mile for a female dancer, then I think you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Judging by IMDb rankings, my guess is that this film was approaching the top 250, and was "bombarded" with many 1s, as is the case with so many films that do not concern the mob, have no special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters. <br /> <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Set mainly in Toronto, the clues are subtle, and some viewers may think it's set entirely in the United States just because the final competition is in the border town of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but I'm not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title sucks. I don't remember anyone in the film that said those words, and should have an "s". (No, it is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There isn't much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume it's an expression of hatred for the kind of people in it, and this is sad.
