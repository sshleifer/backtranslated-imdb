This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends for one night and for one reason or another we surfed on HBO during the evening. There was someone with the name "Eddie Izzard". I tried not to laugh too loudly at first. I didn't want to be held "responsible" for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me. After holding my laughter for something more than healthy, I let go - just like the others of us (we were not stoned, by the way, nor are we talking about insurance and pensions ...). We were suffocated later. The plots, the plot, the bizarre but ingenious connections through the sketches are nothing short of brilliant. Since then I've become addicted to all the Eddie-Izzard comedies I can get my hands on. His work is pure genius. His comedy appears effortless. It looks more like a hysterically amusing friend who walks around your house and talks about this or that ... He is convulsed. It gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and himself, the only true fans of humor, after all. If you are disappointed by this video, you have no sense of the penultimate humor - or humor, as they say in the UK.
