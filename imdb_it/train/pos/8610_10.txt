Diane Keaton gave an exceptional performance in this rather sad but funny story that involved a lot of young people and their dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone", '05, who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words, can describe her. He always called her and said "Surrender Dorothy", which was an expression used in the "Wizard of Oz", 1939. There is a sudden car accident and Natalie plunges deeply with her friends and daughter's lovers. As Natalie investigates, more truth is discovered about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Great movie to see and enjoy, especially the good acting of all the secondary actors.
