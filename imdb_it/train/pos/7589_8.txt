Jay Chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school, but chased away by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a group of thugs in the service of an evil criminal. It happens with the luck cheater, Eric Tsang, who immediately sees the cash potential in the boy's abilities. Basketball is the path chosen for riches and Tsang asks him to earn him a place on a university team and to promote it in the media. The general success leads to a basketball championship and to a very ugly rival team managed by the same nefarious villain as before. <br /> <br /> It's all a bit Shaolin Soccer, but not so bizarre or ridiculous - the plot attacks rather close to sports film conventions and offers all the elements that the public expects from the set-up. You've seen it all before, but it's the kind of thing that never hurts to see again when it's done right. Fortunately it is really well done here (some might say "surprisingly" with Chu Yen-Ping in the director's chair ... I expect it to have good "assistants") - the script gives and the presentation is smooth and elegant. Jay Chou remains practically inexpressive for everything, but such is his style, and when he lets an emotion jump on it can be a good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates with a larger-than-life character who has starred many times (in real life, for example) who gets many of the film's most exciting moments. <br /> <br /> As the film revolves around basketball, it is good that the basketball game scenes are being awakened adequately. The cast shows some real skills, including Chou, and some well-made wireworks and CGIs add that hyper-real element of kung fu skill that makes the scenes even more fun (assuming you like this kind of thing) and justifies the plot / existence of the film. <br /> <br /> There is only one significant fighting scene in the film, but it is doozy in the "one against many" style. Jay Chou seems to be doing a lot of his moves, and it's quite impressive - he's clearly strong enough and really fast, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a true martial artist. I wish there had been more, but at least it's a long battle. <br /> <br /> Much of the Chinese New Year's blockbuster type I was hoping would be from the trailer, and recommended viewing!
