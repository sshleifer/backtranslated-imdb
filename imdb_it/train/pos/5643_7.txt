Mary Pickford ("Born on the Fourth of July" by Angela Moore) is "The Little American"; falls in love with Jack Holt (as Karl Von Austreim), who had moved to America with his German father and his American mother. The French-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin of the "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Mrs. Pickford. The amorous threesome ends up in France, with the Great War (World War I, in hindsight) which greatly complicates their lives. A Cecil B. DeMille film, mostly funny, if propagandistically imperfect. The torpedo and the sinking of a ship carrying Pickford is similar to the "Titanic". The war plot becomes dramatic when Pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for France, while the Germans occupy his ancestral home. Of course, comes the German lover Holt. It was hard to believe that it took so long to recognize each other while he was going for the rape, but it was dark; and, the previous events had believed them dead each other. The film becomes over-the-top WAY in its symbolism. Pickford, by the way, was Canadian, although few could deny that he was not a "small American", in effect. <br /> <br /> FUN to identify "extras" that later became important stars Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - in particular, observe Mr. Novarro who exhibits "star" qualities during one of the most memorable sequences of the film: Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other as he is carried on a stretcher. Novarro even makes Mary Pickford write a letter to him; obviously, it has a future in images. The future is also Ben Alexander, who plays the "Bobby" boy; becomes a reliable child actor and grows up to be a partner of Jack Webb on "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
