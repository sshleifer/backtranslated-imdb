"I like cheap perfume, it doesn't last longer ..." - The character of Ralph Meeker (Lawson) tells it to the character of Helen of Barbara Stanwyck, after hearing the scent she chose with her husband in Tijuana ...! This phrase has upset me and seemed like a metaphor for this film - which is cheap, it's better than expensive, because a cheap man who loves perfumes and has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have for a long time go around ! I agree with some of the other comments published on Helen's attraction to Lawson. Even though her narrative states that she wants Lawson to be put away, she seems attracted to her fiery nature, and that passion she aroused in her would probably not be washed away with the tide!
