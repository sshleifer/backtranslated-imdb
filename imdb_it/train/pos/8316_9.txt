I watched this movie as often as I did, in the 70s when it came out on cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which has fascinated me since (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young and the film made a great impression on me. It was nice to see a movie about other girls growing up, trying to decide who they wanted to be, and making bad and good choices. I was fascinated by the beauty of Lonette McKee, by the large dresses that in the end they wore and by the quick dialogue. As someone raised by a single mother, I could really identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem almost more real than Beyonce Knowles!
