I can't understand why they decided to release this film to present the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. A fist of legend would have been a much better choice. However, Black Mask is not terrible, but it certainly isn't even beautiful. The final combat sequence is well represented by Yuen Woo Ping, who continued to coordinate The Matrix. But the English release suffers from editing and dubbing. (I ask the Hollywood studios to publish these films without subtitles.) Jet Li shows her characteristic charisma in the lead role and Francoise Yip has a cool but short role as the female 701. <br /> <br /> Nero Mask has a strange Gothic style that adds some interest but is overloaded with gunfights and explosions. More attention to Li's fantastic physical abilities was in order. Black Mask is a decent movie but do yourself a favor and collect Fist of Legend if you want to see a fantastic movie that really shows Li's abilities.
