This was the first PPV in a new era for WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel were all gone. A new crop of talents had to be pushed. And all this started with Lex Luger, former NWA world heavyweight champion who was given a header against Yokozuna. Lex traveled all over the United States in a bus called Lex Express to inspire Americans to cheer behind him in an attempt to beat the Japanese monster (which was actually Samoan) and bring the WWE championship back to American hands. As such there was a lot of anticipation for this game. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs an undercard and this has had good things. <br /> <br /> The evening began with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good game. The story of DiBiase had been taken on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his loss to the 1-2-2 Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, angry, then collaborated with the tag 1-2-3 Kid against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To fix their differences they were both given one on one DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid. Razor was able to fix his part of the deal after hitting a Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> Next year came the Steiner Brothers who lined up the WWE Tag Team titles against The Heavenly Bodies. Discover the interference of the manager of "The Bodies" Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull off the win in a decent game. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been in the fight since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels faced Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger. Perfect then cost Michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a match against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title and was putting him in line against Mr. Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner on his 7-foot Diesel bodyguard. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent game here, but it was Diesel who showed the difference between the creator, who pulled Perfect out of the ring and threw him in the steel steps for Shawn to win at the count. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his tag team mate early in the night, easily realizing the Kid 1-2-3. <br /> <br /> Then one of the great matches of the night arrived, while Bret Hart was preparing to fight Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed king of the WWE. But Lawler came out on crutches, saying he had been injured in a traffic accident that day and had arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a good meeting that Hart won with a shooter. He was then jumped from behind by Lawler. He bought WWE president Jack Tunney in the ring who told Lawler that he would get a lifetime ban if he didn't fight Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the chosen shooter, but Hart refused to let go and the referee canceled his decision. So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed king of the WWE. This match was followed by Ludvig Borda who destroyed Marty Janetty in a short game. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker ended its long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which began in 1992 when the Undertaker defeated Wippleman's client Kamala in Summerslam and continued when Wippleman's last monster The Giant Gonzales he had destroyed Taker al Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then turned on Wippleman, suffocating him after a poor match. <br /> <br /> Then it's time for the action of six tags such as smoking Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka capturing Samu. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Fuji, putting the WWE title on the front line against Lex Luger and it was all on board the Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex came back even though he was able to avoid a banzai fall and then the body slam Yokozuna before throwing him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji while Yokozuna was expelled. Luger had won a good game !!!!! The balloons fell from the ceiling. The heroes all came to congratulate him on his victory. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger had shown that he could be defeated. The only question was: who could beat him in the ring and get that title from him?
