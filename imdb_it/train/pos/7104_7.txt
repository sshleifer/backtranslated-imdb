Los Debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who moved to Santiago from the South after their mother died. The confident and streetwise Silvio, the elder brother, gets a job working for a sleazy owner of the strip club after bringing the naive Victor there for his 17th birthday. <br /> <br /> While Silvio flourishes under the protection of his boss, both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative lover, Gracia. As the film develops, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and clear ways that each one manipulates the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well done, with good cinematography and a fast pace. She is also very sexy, with a lot of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. Use the now popular technique of stratifying different scenes from different points of view, out of chronological sequence. Many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies use this device. The plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good film noir. <br /> <br /> As the different levels are revealed, our interpretations of the characters and their motivations evolve. While the plot can be quite clich√©, it's also smart and fun. <br /> <br /> I would call it a fun movie, which is worth looking at, but nothing memorable. I haven't seen many films from Chile, and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries. In addition to this, rent it if it is available but do not lose sleep if it is not.
