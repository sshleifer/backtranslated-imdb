I haven't seen all of Chan's films, but this is definitely the best I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story itself is nothing really special, so I won 'deepen this. What makes it special are the stunts, the fights, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The film has a time full of anger and you are simply stunned to see it. All the beautiful stunts (obviously made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump on the couch and scream. It's just great! My mother was also struck by this fantastic movie when she saw it. <br /> <br /> I know this police story can be a bit difficult to get, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth trying.
