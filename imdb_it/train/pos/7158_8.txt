Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is unjustly convicted of theft, he is sent to "Camp Green Lake". In this field, the Keeper and his two henchmen, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski command camp mates to dig holes after hole after hole. But why? Stanley is going to find out. <br /> <br /> I've never had any intention of watching 'Holes', and I have to admit that I've only seen the movie, because I'm a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of it, then it doesn't matter . 'Holes' is one of those Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautifully written and incorporates a wonderful idea to include flashbacks in the past. These are not distracting and really give a great story. The whole cast is fantastic. The young stars perform well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf proves that even at the age of seventeen he can act without defects. This is a Disney movie, you would surely enjoy it as a family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
