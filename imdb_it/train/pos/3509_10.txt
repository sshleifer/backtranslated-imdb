I saw this movie a while back and it is still at the top of my list of "favorite movies". It is extraordinarily put together and what really makes the film are the small detailed details (like the "Cafe Bustelo" coffee crate that is reused as a cup for washing the grandchildren's hair) that people don't see because they DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS FILM A LESS THAN IT IS HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that is culturally specific and particular. Please don't beat this movie if you don't have a preliminary understanding of which foundation was built. I completely see what the writer / director was looking for, and he hit the mark perfectly! This film is highly deserving of a better evaluation.
