Unfortunately due to rights issues, it will almost certainly never happen. The transcripts of Joe Bob's commentary on the subtitle films he screened are available on the Internet, but fail to capture his inflicted twang, which was a blast. Nowadays, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is limited to making additional features of classics like "I Spit On Your Grave" (with what some exploitative fans define as the biggest gang rape on all time), and Jason X, one of the most revered Friday 13th sequel of all time (the series was never the same once Paramount was left). All I could think of when they canceled was, "Damn, where else will I have meat filled, jokes, and trivia on horror every Saturday night? Does that mean I have to have a life now?" Unfortunately, it does. But there will always be a place in my heart hungry for "Monstervision". Long live the Drive-In!
