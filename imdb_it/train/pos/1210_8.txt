And my kids love it now! Of course, I can watch it now and understand that the animation was not great, and that the plot is trivial. Hey, if all the villagers presented themselves saying "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they could be laughed at, but for young children it's a moral story with catchy music. <br /> <br /> Music so catchy, mind you, that I still had the words memorized after not having seen this movie in twenty years. I would definitely recommend this for small children.
