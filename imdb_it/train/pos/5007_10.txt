Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply fantastic! From her skit as a child to her mix of songs in a high fashion department store - everything was top notch! It was easy to understand how this special received awards. <br /> <br /> Not confused by guest appearances, attention remained on Barbra throughout the production.
