This very funny English comedy shows what could happen if a section of London, in this case Pimlico, were to declare itself independent of the rest of the United Kingdom and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. The explosion of a bomb in time of war leads to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical note long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they wish, free from any interference by Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as a minor citizen politician who suddenly finds himself driving one of the smallest nations in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as a history professor who sided with Pimlico. Others in the leading cast include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
