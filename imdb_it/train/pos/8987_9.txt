I recently rented this document, having remembered hearing it from IMDb.com and being intrigued by the premise. I knew very little about these two bands, but I remember hearing "Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth" by Dandy Warhols centuries ago and enjoying it. That being said, this is my perspective on the doc: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible in this film is that you don't need to have any previous knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) wastes no time in engaging the public and becoming familiar with the people in this film. I soon fell in love with the lives of both Anton and Courtney and their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think it's part of what makes this doc so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner such a documentarian. <br /> <br /> I also loved the way the "story" of these bands was told. Most of what you see is of touring bands. Both bands start playing in small places and struggle to do it in the record industry. Throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. However, this is what makes the two bands similar, and therefore the brilliant perspective on how two feather bands can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> Basically I would recommend it to ANYONE who loves movies in general. It is not necessary to have a particular love for documentaries or one of the bands. An appreciation for music helps, but the music itself takes a secondary role in the love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
