A fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical fame, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the passionate search for artistic expression of a young Italian woman and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film features sumptuous costumes and set designs and a good cast and acting. However, he is confused in his attempt to represent the esotericism of art and time and is not inspired in his representation of the artist's passion as painted on canvas and explored through his involvement with men. A good movie for those interested in Renaissance painting or vintage films.
