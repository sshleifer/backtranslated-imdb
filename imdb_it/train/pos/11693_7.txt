This film is a remake of two films that have been much better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see it. This is not so nice. The last third of the film is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that took him where he is today. However, I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this film. Sounds like a bad "B" movie where people sound like they're on some bad TV sit-com. The situations are forced and it's as if they were just trying to bring the story back so they can start the real movie. It all seems fake and the assembly is just wrong. I don't know how they could release this movie that way. In any case, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and then watch.
