Too many sources routinely taint this drama of the provocative period, partly based on historical facts, along with the superficial similar "nunsploitation" that was the backbone of European 70s waste cinema, neglecting the right rage that drives the entire enterprise. Perhaps coincidentally it was also the singular attempt of the director Gianfranco Mingozzi to make narrative films outside of many well-received documentaries. <br /> <br /> Set in a historical context, FLAVIA traces the growing rebellion of an early-fifteenth-century Italian nun (Florinda Bolkan's career, surpassing even her excellent work in the devastating DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING by Lucio Fulci) , confined in a convent by the not so noble father in a desperate attempt to curb the sensual and budding nature of the girl. Wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles in the best life as in the scriptures, is faced with ways in which male domination can break female life, inspiring a revolt fueled by the madness of half-disgusted Sister Agatha (portrayed so indelible by a veteran actress Maria Casarès of LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS by Marcel Carné) and - more constructively - by a Muslim invasion. Joining the oppressors and perhaps unconsciously manipulating them to make her offer, Flavia really becomes the outcast she felt herself already, with expected tragic results. <br /> <br /> With his stunning widescreen compositions by Alfio Contini, who shot Antonioni's Michelangelo ZABRISKIE POINT, this is an intransigent and austere tale of the fierce struggle but at the futile end of a woman against the patriarchal society that the he assigned no rights beyond pregnancy or whore, as his sister Agatha ironically remembers. Despite a long drug-induced fantasy sequence, clearly modeled on DEVILS, otherwise much more flamboyant, than Ken Russell, the film is relatively stingy in the leather department, turning into something of a mockery in its semi-pornographic reputation. This is a serious work that deserves the rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly blurred reputation.
