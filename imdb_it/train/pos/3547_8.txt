Musical entertainment in which Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to play a game of floating cocks, so he draws Sky Masterson to try to get the girl from the salvation army, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to L ' Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons would be back in the missionary in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry". There she was Sister Sharon and here she is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is that diabolical Nathan Detroit. He was engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and hates his gambling habit. <br /> <br /> In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually did his singing here! <Br /> <br /> The film is saved by a superlative choreography. Those dance and singing choreographies are fabulous. They are especially made by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice production.
