Hi, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still a holic crazy. It was just another movie I was watching on TV partly. Then I had to take the video to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed the first signs of decomposition after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to get my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several movie posters and the script of the film. Right now it has become so worse that I try to push other people to addiction to my website and the Still Crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What drove me to addiction? <br /> <br /> OK, it's one of those clever but somehow sad and melancholy comedies like only the English can produce. <br /> <br /> Okay, the film is worlds different from things like 'This Is Spinal Tap', because of the characters, which are not childish or ultra cool, but real. This is a story of aging men. A story of men who get along. Or not. It contains some of the best possible actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy who stages one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones of the stranger wrote the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bassist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, plays the egocentric but clumsy singer Ray Simms. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you only heard Bill Nighy singing "Love Actually", you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will have fever for every scene that will come for the x-th time, especially those concert scenes. He would die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing "All Over The World", singing on top of your lungs. You want to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit at the Wisbech festival stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is a world in which this band really exists I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Got Still Crazy ... someone?
