If you have not seen this excellent film about life in the 90s (in L.A.) then you missed a special treatment. This is one of the most incredible and powerful films ever made about life for Americans in the 1990s and even affects the world we live in today. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. and the list goes on. This story creates an extreme climax and then, when it counts for nothing, it always returns to love with friends, family and love for life. It helps us dig deep inside ourselves and make us look for what we want from life. It makes us ask ourselves questions. We've done enough for others, we like it, etc. ??? Sit down and enjoy a fantastic and exciting movie that I'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Take note of the wonderful performance of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover throughout this film. These actors are fantastic and really show the true splendor and meaning of what message is sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie over 10 years ago. I have fun again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter flying and try to understand that it is the symbolism for the movie ?? hmmm ... I almost forgot that this is probably Steve Martin's first serious acting role in every movie he has ever made. He also does an excellent job in this film. This could come as a surprise to many of you. Sit down, relax and enjoy a really good movie .....
