This is not the best Bela Lagosi film, but it has a good old-fashioned approach to the horror entertainment of the 40s. <br /> <br /> Brides fall dead on the altar like flies. I think I'd postpone the wedding until the demon is captured, but it's a horror movie, so I guess people ignore the danger for some reason. However, Lagosi is a crazy doctor, who needs the blood of a young woman to keep his sick old wife healthy and happy. Always Lira the Keystone Cop hiding the bodies in a hearse (who could think of looking for a corpse in a hearse?), And the brides continue to zap. <br /> <br /> No film like this would be complete without a Lois Lane type journalist who wants to capture the criminal on his own. He's good at solving crime, keeping his mouth shut at all the wrong times, guessing who chooses Lagosi for his next designated victim. I love the piece of the "haunted house" where Lois Lane is stranded by a storm as a guest of the left villa of Lagosi. Hidden passages, a vampire-like wife, an evil assistant Igor nano and so on. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> The well done rhythm keeps the film in motion and the story is resolved in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, this is worth a watch.
