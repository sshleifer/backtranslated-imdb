I saw it last night on TV (HBO). I must admit that the tension in this film has been unsurpassed by most of the other films of the FN era. I loved the way Chip would have been calm for a moment and then VIOLENT the next. It was classic Ah yes The ladies, the villagers, the cigars and the criminal cops! It has everything. This film gave me all the goods. I particularly loved the way they mixed communism with plot, very common for this era of the film. Very bold also because the blacklist was popular in those days. I consider this film one of the best I've seen in the FN genre!
