LA RAGAZZA DEL MISSOURI arrives in New York knowing exactly what she wants: to be something solid by marrying a millionaire without losing her virginity. With its beautiful beauty, it quickly catches the eye of a tycoon's son, but remaining faithful to his virtue he will also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. With her platinum-colored hair and beautiful accessories, she is a dazzling one. But her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also an excellent actress. It has rightly earned its place in the highest part of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast offers Harlow excellent support: Lionel Barrymore as the cunning old tycoon, wise in the streets of Harlow; beautiful Franchot Tone as his son, in love with love; the raucous Patsy Kelly, who steals her scenes as Harlow's shoulder; the debonair Alan Mowbray, like a well-behaved Englishman; the elderly Clara Blandick as Barrymore's gritty secretary; friendly Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for women; muscled Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who captures Kelly's flirty eye; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced immediately after the establishment of the Hollywood Production Code. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which the character of Harlow follows the same purposes, but uses very different means.
