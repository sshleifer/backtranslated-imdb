If you're not in the mood for more than an hour of film, this movie could give you some variation. What I love are the surprises in progress. It's not just once you want one or more of the "New York I Love You" short films to continue. Yes, some short films make you curious, some of them are very short, some of them longer, some of them have specific purposes, others do not. <br /> <br /> Much of history has the sad side of the capital. Show many backgrounds of different nationalities. Many of them make him feel the same way I once was in a capital city in other countries for a year in which he received many people from different countries. This film explores many types of things you may have known, but for all the characters it's a novelty. Perhaps some of you have traveled abroad alone for a year or two just to try something new, meet new people; feeling dreamy, sad, but the kind of sadness you are looking for because it's just that you get bored at home. You may want to relive it again by watching it.
