This film is definitely one of my favorite films of its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally incorruptible characters is an ode to chivalry and the code of honor between thieves and policemen. It treats issues such as duty, guilt, speech, manipulation and trust as few films have done and, unfortunately, none of what I can remember from the death of the "policial" in the late 1970s. The sequence is delicious, down to the essentials, experiencing nothing and thus bringing the viewer into a right and wrong masterly plot without captivating and captivating spectacular scenes that are often needed in fewer examples of the genre to keep the audience awake. There are no such or necessary scenes. The topic is flowless and honest to the viewer, which is an important resource in a genre where suspense is often achieved through public betrayal. No, we did not miss Marble ... A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
