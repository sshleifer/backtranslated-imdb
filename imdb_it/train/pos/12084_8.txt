A tiny, stupid little thing, whose 65-minute length doesn't seem like a second one too short, My Name is Julia Ross draws on an English tradition of things that aren't what they seem - Hitchcock's Lady Vanishes is an example. Julia Ross (Nina Foch), out of work, finds a dream job in a new recruitment agency in London, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to know if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. After turning to duty, she wakes up (after being drugged) in a huge Manderley-like pile on the Cornish coast, presumably like George Macready's wagging wife, who shows an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. His adorable and compelling mother is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of effervescent efficiency on the other side of good against evil than he had occupied in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this story takes place in a claustrophobic way; we know what's going on, but we can't tell poor Julia. Curiously, this film regularly receives a place of honor as one of the first (and very few English) film noir. I think it's closer to the old-obscure Gothic tradition than the American one of wet pebbles and urban corruption; however, it shows a more modern and psychoanalytic way of thinking. Whatever you call it, it remains an extremely satisfying thriller.
