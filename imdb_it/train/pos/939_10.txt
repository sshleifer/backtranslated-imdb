Okay, there are a lot of reviews here, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I will try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason why this is my favorite Scrooge is thanks to EVERYTHING. The sets, the outdoor places, the costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet The supporting cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew, played by Roger Rees. His sincere sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also an absolutely credible Bob Cratchit. His is a difficult life, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course - is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said that his portrait is too gruff. I could not disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning while they were cold or harsh, were not out of character. He is a terribly disillusioned man whose heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and by his own desire for wealth. <br /> <br /> During flashbacks, it is obvious that it is not entirely grumpy. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he had completely disappeared, his partner Marley would never have come for his own good in the first place. And after all, none of us is hoping for the past. I think it's a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge watches his dance with his employer with Belle, you see him smile with regret as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will go through life "with a smile on my face". Clive Donner was smart enough to allow the director to give these moments to the cinema. Sometimes they are left on the floor of the assembly room. <br /> <br /> And finally, his conversion is so utterly full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time I see it. His apologies to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy it brings to Fred, to his wife are so obvious. And the line that makes me every time, "God forgive me for the time I have wasted." <br /> <br /> Well done everyone!
