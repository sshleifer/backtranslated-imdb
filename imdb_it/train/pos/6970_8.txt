This is one of those movies / pilots that if you know BattleStar Galactica helps, but it's not necessary. What makes this story even more credible than BSG is that it is not that far in the future. This has such depth that it is quite surprising that it was not distributed in the room. The protagonists could not have been better chosen by such expert and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is as superb as his father who will do anything to be reunited with his daughter, however real or not, and he will, at any cost. Paula Malcomson of the fame of "Deadwood" is as formidable as his wife. You are not completely sure of his motives, be it love or money or both, but this is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in Zoe's creation interpreted by the relative unknown Alessandra Torresani and her interpretation. Esai Morales is terrifying in his desire to see his beloved again and how wrong it is to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. I didn't think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but from the pilot alone I'm thrilled to see how we got to the BSG stage story. It's nice to see Adama as a child already affected and influenced by the different types of robots that begin to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep up with the stories so you can understand even more how they got the humanoid-typed robots. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can keep the fantastic storytelling. Visual effects are also better than most junk you see on the big screen. If you have not joined BSG, at least try this and I bet you will become a fan and you will want to see how the BSG story was born.
