I've never seen many movies online in most of my life, but if I chose any of them, I'd choose Spatula Madness, a clever reference to most movies like star troopers (etc.), using a camera, and steel wit , Jason Steele mastered the art of transforming a normal image into a painting, then putting it all together with animation frame by frame to get a world inhabited by spatulas. the story begins at the center, what is the joy of the directors? so the medium is at the beginning, and so on, when I looked at it for the first time, I was expecting a weak appearance, but Jason, like me, looks at Loves, so he took every detail to the max. even if I don't recommend it for children, or someone like me, but look for it on the net (it's a short film, look at the cow in the film), his style reminds me of South Park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for the laughter and 6 for the story, everything comes to a 10/10, good job <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm anxious to see the film.
