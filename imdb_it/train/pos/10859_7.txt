Not to be confused with the eponymous high school film Resse Witherspoon, this is a stylized look from the Hong Kong triads. It's called election because a new leader or "president" is elected by ancient traditions every two years. Two candidates are vying for the position and, for ego, bribes and track records, the race is strained to say the least. Cleverly directed at introducing you to a large cast without ever confusing the twists of the story before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. The Asian godfather is not like that, but it is a fun thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the verge of your place and start with violence. Subtitle volume 1 I think it is safe to say that there will be more episodes as we go deeper into the dark world of the triads and into all their dying business affairs. In any case, this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great movie in its own right.
