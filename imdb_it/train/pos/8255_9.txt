Fido is a pretty comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that should entertain us these days. <br /> <br /> As has already been pointed out, this is certainly not a real zombie movie, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers. Although there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost nothing and the way this film is presented (1950s style), I can't imagine anyone being really scared or excluded by Fido and his fellow sufferers . > <br /> While the cast is generally good, I heard that Moss and Nelson stood out. Humor is not in-your-face, but rather subdued; there is a lot of attention to detail and I found myself smiling kindly in different parts of the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie manages to deliver a black comedy that warms the heart.
