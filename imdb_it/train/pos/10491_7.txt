A delightful gentle comic gem, until the last five minutes, which degenerated into the run of the British TV farce. The last five minutes cost 2 points in my evaluation. Despite this important plot and stylistic flaw, it is worth observing the acting of the character and the unique Cornish setting. Many beautiful little things to savor, like the tense eternity that we all spend waiting for the approval of the bank after the employee has canceled the credit card ... made more spicy when we are not - sure enough that the card does not is at most.
