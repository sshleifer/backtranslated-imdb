Today if someone mentions the name of Victor McLaglen the answer will most likely be "Who?" or maybe "Why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in this movie, which is about a poor and desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend to "carfare" in the United States. It's an interesting film that shows how low even the best shnooks will go for just a few dollars. The film takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all the other characters fight directly or indirectly for Ireland's political independence, all of Mr. McLaglen's character is worried about getting money and getting drunk. The film asks if political activism is worth everything because, while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what it is. The moral of this film is: pay attention to the friend, he could sell you for a dime.
