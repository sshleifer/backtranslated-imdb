This show is fantastic. I thought that the two episodes in which Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were fantastic; Kerry was my favorite character, because he was in the "dark side". I also thought Bridget was funny because she was all excited. I also thought that that guy who played Kyle was really, really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic comments about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole TV show is fun and I would like them to show it again on TV. when they showed it on TV, however, I watched it every time it was turned on. Next time I see him, I'll watch him again and again.
