When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was captured by the human drama shown by Gabriel and anyone who cares and loves. That being said, we were given the film version of an excellent story and expected to see beyond the glory of Hollywood ... The writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner really succeeded! <br /> <br /> With the right amount of moderation, Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and shows us his struggle with trust problems both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna ). <br /> <br /> As we are presented to the players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young person turns into a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to move forward and move forward. <br /> <br /> It is bad that most people will avoid this movie. I'm just saying because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role?" It didn't work before! "PLEASE GIVE THIS FILM TO CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness that we all have to find and cross in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo has intensified as an actor and made another work of art quality. <br /> <br /> Oh and before you forget, I think Bobby Cannavale while Jess steals every scene he finds himself in. The looks and the presence of the 1940 screen. It is this hacker's opinion that could lead his movie right now !! <br /> <br /> S ~
