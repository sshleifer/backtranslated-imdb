Well, I'm going to go against the tide in this movie, so it seems. Being a confessed horror fan, I sat at it not knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I actually found myself scared (quite rare). The film obviously has a limited budget and is set around the charing cross station, but the films lack money and don't distract the plot. Yes, the story is a bit far-fetched and is not explained very well, but THE CREEP is a class act and proceeds to cut and dismember whatever comes. MESSAGE FOR WOMEN !!! THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE FILM YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR EYES OR AT LEAST CROSS YOUR LEGS !! you will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie and make a change in seeing a good slasher movie that actually is scary
