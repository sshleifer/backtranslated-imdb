Without doubt the best of John Le Carre's novels, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Czech controller of Magnus), Ray McAnally (father of Magnus with-man) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, mentor of Magnus, British believer and controller), along with the rest of the characters, they are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for the casting there should have received a prize. Even the smallest parts, like Major Membury, are performed to perfection. He says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters of the novel that, despite Magnus's duplicity, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of US intelligence. . I have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the film almost every time and continue to be hypnotized by both. If you had a book to take to a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice more than any other.
