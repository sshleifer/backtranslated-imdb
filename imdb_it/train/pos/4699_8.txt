This did for the crime what "Not Another Teen Movie" did for the school. I laughed to the hilt when two inept bands clashed with each other. An unwanted comedy that used jokes and explicit gags that made me go all the way. I suppose the biggest gag in the whole film is that it never seems to go on that time leaving the characters trapped in the 1930s.
