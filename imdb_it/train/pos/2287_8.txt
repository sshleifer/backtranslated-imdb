This film has pleasantly surprised me. He has a moving approach, slightly off-center, that never loses your attention. This is a film I have never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper", this is it. Great writing, production and acting. I highly recommend it to an audience that wants something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why wasn't more done in this movie?
