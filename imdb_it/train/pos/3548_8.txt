I just saw the film version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And he thought that the Havana sequences in which Simmons and Brando danced a storm were excellent. Even those were really impressive for me and usually they were the highlights of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film that originated from a story by Damon Runyon takes some time with the slow rhythm of non-musical scenes, but after a while it involves you. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so compelling for me, but it had their charm especially during the "Sue Me" issue. He also loved Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" issue and performances by Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical look everywhere, Guys and Dolls is not a great musical musical, but certainly a very good one.
