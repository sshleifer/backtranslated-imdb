The actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a soccer player of a soccer entrepreneur who acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for little money to the rival club of Benfica (club of the heart), FC Porto, so these players do not have played well, and wanted FC Porto to be wrong with this. But what happens is that these two players, after all, are good and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club, making a good deal. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great antecedents in the big films, is a very good and funny comedy, which shows all the rivalry that exists between North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
