I had never heard of this movie until I found it by accident while browsing on IMDB. I saw that he had gotten many terrible reviews containing very colorful curses about how he smelled. Obviously this meant that I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised that Whipped is actually quite a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we did in many recent successful Hollywood comedies. This is an independent film and as such describes the subject (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood falsehood. I clearly suspect that people's opinion on this film will depend a lot on their life experience. If you have never attended or celebrated a lot you will not get this movie because you have not met people like these characters. If you have it, you will recognize many of the situations they portray here in a comical way. The ending was also good, as they do not portray women as unreal romantic, defenseless and virgins in contrast to many Hollywood films.
