52-Pick Up has never achieved the respect it should have. It works on many levels and has a complicated but viable plot. The actors involved give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly expressed and provide portraits of deep characters. Also notable is Vanity, who should have turned him into a serious acting career, given the unexpected ability he shows, and Kelly Preston, whose character will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who loves action combined with a gritty and complicated story, will appreciate this.
