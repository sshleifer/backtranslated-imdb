"Winchester '73" marked the first in a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them, Stewart's hero has a violent edge that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a "one in a thousand" rifle that belongs to the competition at a rifle shot held in Dodge City, July 4, 1876. In the city comes Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his fellow High Spade (Millard Mitchell) who are on the trail of Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a vile past. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) with the saloon girl Lola (Shelley Winters) out of town. It turns out that Dutch Henry is also in town for shooting the rifle. Lin and Dutch Henry win the coveted award with Lin's victory, but Dutch Henry steals Lin from the gun and flees. <br /> <br /> Lin and High Spade follow Dutch Henry across the country where they meet Lola with his cowardly coward Steve Miller (Charles Drake) resists in an American cavalry field awaiting an attack by the Indians led from Young Bull (Rock Hudson) who acquired the prized rifle by killing the cunning gunner John McIntyre. He took the weapon betraying Dutch Henry to poker. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet the infamous gunman Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea) who kills Steve and takes the value of the gun and Lola for himself. When Dean meets the Dutchman Henry, he allows him to shoot "his gun", planning to kill him later. In the town of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean while Dutch Henry's plans to hold the bank go badly and he runs off into the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best outs ever, the two meet in the final showdown. I believe this film was the only one of Stewart / Mann's collaborations shot in B&W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "wide open spaces" and, in particular, the final showdown. Stewart plays against the guy, plays the hero with a violent desire for revenge, an emotion he would bring to future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> As in most Western westerns, this boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day. In addition to the ones mentioned above, JC Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff chasing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as a soldier and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence. <br /> <br /> A classic western in every sense. He was responsible for the regeneration of Stewart's career as an action star.
