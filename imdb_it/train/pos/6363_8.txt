I was a fan of the series as a child and later it always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made the difference in the early 1980s compared to the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une Fois the Homme. .., most of which I love). I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this type published later may not correspond to Mazinger Z, since they have begun to repetitively repeat the same pattern. <br /> <br /> That thing, the novelty, could be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another positive aspect is its inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; actually, we were anxious to see every new episode to find out what kind of new demon or evil machine was waiting for us!
