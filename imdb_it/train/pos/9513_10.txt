A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes directed this beautiful film showing another father-son camaraderie. The brilliant cast of lead actors with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a fantastic job. He recited from him again. He is a legend of acting. Also interested in Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig.Casting is too good. The plot is pretty good. You will like the movie. A great portrait of the 1930s gangster. In the 1930s, this certainly stands out as the zenith of all gangster films of that era. Soundtrack is quite suitable for the film. A great film in total that shows what a father does to protect his child. It was underestimated for my taste. He deserved a fully deserved 10.
