Whenever someone asks me to name the scariest movie I've ever seen, I invariably say "Black Noon" and to this day no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening. As far as I know, it was only shown once in the UK and unfortunately is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can track down a copy please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I had looked at it again, it probably would have been a great disappointment but it has always remained etched in my memory like a particularly disturbing little movie!
