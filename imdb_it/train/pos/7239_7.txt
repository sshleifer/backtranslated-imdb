What a gem of a movie, so beautiful to have made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The film really starts well with an unpleasant monster that eats some people and a party where the two main characters first look at each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, a bit of a clue to who this character is, who moved to the city and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a home. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've seen all the vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The film is watchable, but the actors' performances are very wooden and seem like I don't want to be in this film, but it could be that it's part of the decadent environment. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the ending, but there is a sequel, you have to track it down. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes was not suited to the part. Later, I couldn't stop thinking about him, he exuded a strange sensuality, so maybe he was right about the part. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES The last time in 'Hitler - the rise of evil' as the ten. Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is it now?
