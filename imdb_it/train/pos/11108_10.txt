Well ... easily my favorite TV series ever. Call me a clich√© on the walking post but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. In a show and you're already winning points in my book. Combine all this with the acting that surpasses anything you've ever seen on the small screen, add the direction that adapts to vintage cinema and above all to writing that makes the mind splash (and some brains along the way) and you are made a show for which it is very difficult to compete. <br /> <br /> Especially two actors, James Gandolfini in the role of Tony Soprano and Edie Falco in the role of His wife Carmela ... like Gandolfini, adapts to his debut a way in which words cannot express themselves, if you didn't see him as a tony, but now you see it! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on and on all the characters in the show, the psychological brilliance, the scenes, etc. but you wouldn't be able to stop me, so all I can say is that it's the only show with Seinfeld, that I'm able to look endlessly from start to finish and end up enjoying it more.
