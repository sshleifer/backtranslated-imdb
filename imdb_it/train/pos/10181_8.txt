Initially I bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, I didn't know that Aishwarya would appear in an article number in the last quarter of the film in a song she shares with SRK and helps present her character who has been in the film for about 15 years. minutes. Shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, entering into knowledge and embracing the harsh realities of life. The article number in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the film. It is actually a dream sequence that occurs while the drunk SRK character is passed out of the liquor. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who one day shows up at her favorite meeting point, dressed succinctly and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is "Ishq Kamina" (freely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's simply steaming hot! Not to be missed.
