This was the first of the Panahi films I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne film festival. I was totally absorbed by the different characters he created and how they reacted and behaved differently than the Australian boys and, again, on other levels, in a similar way. I think maybe if more people could watch movies like this, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by fear of the unknown. There are obvious big political differences between the culture of Oz and Iranian culture, but I found the most subtle differences between the characters, that this film appears so successfully on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem so unique to me. I found it made the compelling vision of the characters.
