While Rome goes crazy celebrating Hitler's visit - uniforms, gangs, parades - two strangers remain at home, in a large building, and end up meeting. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of a brutal public official and mother of six children. It is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was fired because of his homosexuality. Both need company and understanding, both find each other. <br /> <br /> The film covers a few hours. The color is faded and everything happens with a soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio announcers. Strangely, the Nazi anthem - the Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> Wonderful film, excellent recreation of a special era in Italian history and a moving sad story. Mastroianni is as good as expected and Sofia Loren does a great job, far from her usual pin-up, the Neapolitan fishmonger. Not to be missed.
