No one would argue that this 1945 war movie was a masterpiece. (How could a 1945 war movie be a masterpiece?) Yet this is an extremely effective tale of a true story, that of Al Schmidt, blinded on Guadalcanal, played by John Garfield, who spent days wearing a bandage to capture the nuances of a blind man's actions. Robert Leckie, in "Helmet for My Pillow", denigrates Schmidt's popularity in favor of his friend foxhole, who was killed, writing that "the country must have needed live heroes". <br /> <br /> Well, I suppose the country did. And they had one here. There is a single fight scene in the film, linked to the studio lot, which lasts only about ten minutes, and which occurs less than half of the film instead of being saved for the climax, but it is the scariest representation and most realistic of the men under the fire that I remember seeing on the screen, including those of "Save Private Ryan". Men scream in fear, shout at each other and against the enemy, bleed and die, without the help of color, stereo sound, ringing or blood. <br /> <br /> Simply from a technological point of view, the film is exceptional. It is not just that we learn how complicated a mechanism of a caliber 30 brown, water cooled caliber, or that it should be fired in bursts of a few blows, or that it is not shaken like a hose fire, as in so many other war movies . Technical precision adds compelling quality to the scene. The need to stick to short bursts is terrifying when dozens of screaming enemies spill out onto a stream fifty yards away with the sole purpose of exterminating you and your two isolated companions confined to a small cannon station. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not clever, including those of the ubiquitous support of the 40s, John Ridgeley, and a radiant and young Eleanor Parker. The plot of the love story is spartan, but it works, and in the end it's quite moving. An extraordinary sequence of dreams is included. It is not Bunuel, but for a routine film of 1945, it stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script, or may have been altered by someone else. He could have used the kind of pruning that could have introduced some much needed ambiguity. However, there are strange verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer - "Why doesn't God hit me dead?" And, "In the eyes, Lee, stick them in the eyes!" Depth of anguish in a few banal words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by veteran wounded in a 1945 war movie. <br /> <br /> Notes that may seem fake to a contemporary audience but perhaps shouldn't: the dated vernacular that is hard to believe that many of the today's children may have thought it was ever spoken - "private gab", "drugs", "drop by drop", "gee", "stupid coot", "lady", "a smart guy" and "feel sorry for you himself ". We consider the historical context and be gentle in our judgments. At the time, some of this idiotic jargon was at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Real weaknesses? Wounded veterans get together and discuss quantity of a collective future they have and the subject is over-solved with a conclusion along the lines of: "Just because you have a silver platter in your head does not mean that people think they are a bad person. "Sometimes there are off-screen voices and silent prayers that are both useless and even unimaginative." Please, God, let me come back to me, "and that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, the directors were operating within the limits of their times, which is perhaps why the final fade is on a stroke of Independence Hall and the inspirational thrusts of "America the Beautiful" swell in the back. <br /> <br /> "None of this can undo the virtues of the film, which are considerable, particularly the impact of that horrible fighting scene. It is not on television that often. If you have a chance, take it in all ways.
