First of all, this should not be a brilliant and inspiring film, as many other reviewers seem to compare it. the first review says something along the lines of those who love this, they don't know anything about horror movies, apparently it's the opposite. If one looked back after the film, it wasn't meant to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But this is all it aimed at, it was meant to blow the spectators away with their shock value (and all the imperfections were much less evident in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave this a high score because it achieved its goal and even though it wasn't absolutely horrible (in a non-shocking sense) it made me slightly sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic (I didn't I trust someone for about a week because I didn't want to wake up and get tortured)
