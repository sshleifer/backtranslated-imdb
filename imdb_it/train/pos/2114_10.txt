Two shopkeepers at war in a leather store turned out to be secret boyfriends because they correspond to the aliases of the box number. Within this simple idea and a daily environment, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, intensity and irony that never gives up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as a medium couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own plots and lines. Although mistakenly eclipsed by the great Stewart films of 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith), this is easily on par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtleties not seen in other films.
