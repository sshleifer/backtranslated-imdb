Taken in the context of the time in which it was made, I found this a remarkable film. While the details can be "dramatized", the overall story was a good primer. Also, I found actors that they knew, that I knew a real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a coward? I will leave the rest of the star that identifies you. As for the secondary cast, this film (as you would expect from a movie shot in the late 1930s) has many funny characters, but the best compliments for Andrew Jackson's right-hand man, Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well filmed, with beautiful ships, and a competent acting all the time, I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for the field a little or an eye for a double period piece, set at the dawn of America, and made at a time when big names and high-level actors were a real pleasure.
