Although I haven't seen this mini-series in more than twenty years, I still remember how the balance between character, plot and story of wonderful adventures succeeded. The use of special effects has been restrained by making a more poetic rather than literal narrative of history. The two versions I've seen have been dubbed (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their language not only Italian, so there's a synchronization problem. It does not ruin history. Among the cast Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable for North Americans. Recommended for all the followers of Odysseus who always return.
