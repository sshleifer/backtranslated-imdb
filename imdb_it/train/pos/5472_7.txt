Barbara Stanwyck is a real hard biscuit, a working class maid (and prostitute at the hands of her father) who flees to New York City and uses her feminine wiles to get a deposit, moving to Mortgage and Escrow and later as assistant secretary of the second in command at the bank. The dramatic study of a female character who is not afraid of being inconvenient has lost none of her power over the years, with Barbara acting like a storm (portraying a woman learning to be a first-rate actress). Looking at a small Nietzschean philosophy in her messy life, this lady crushes all the feeling, but never loses our charm, our astonishment. She is a simple girl, firm, but she is not a bitch, nor is she a man-eater or a woman who hates. This girl is all for herself, and while we wait for her to learn about the true values ​​of life, her journey up and down the ladder of success offers sexy and heated entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) is good at first as an assistant in the file, even if all the support players are pretty good. *** from ****
