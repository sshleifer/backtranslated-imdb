This movie is fantastic! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film that portrays Muslims as PEOPLE, without stereotypes here. This film is guided by history, by acting and above all by the theme, that of affirmation and cultural discovery. They may seem clich√© but they are not, at least not in this film. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely stunning and the public is given a taste of a side of the Muslim world that is rarely ever shown in the West. Here people are considerate, supportive, devoted, tolerant and devoted to one another. What an advantage and a long-awaited departure from the usual negative portraits of the Arabs. Outstanding film.
