"A Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it is certainly a good and fun comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the morning after his memoryless bachelor party and Becky (Julia Stiles) lying naked in her bed. Before he can figure out what happened, Becky rushes out of her apartment because her boyfriend Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. Then, as you can imagine, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Almost every single scene in "A Guy Thing" offers loud laughter. The funniest moments come when Paul imagines what might happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a very talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that she is underutilized. Although, it turns out to be more fun than the character of Stiles, which really isn't that interesting. Of course, not all comedies are perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
