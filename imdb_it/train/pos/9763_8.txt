Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first film I've ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and me, and the funny thing is that when we got home, Dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we want to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my father took us back to the theater to look at him again - or so I remember. I was five at the time. <br /> <br /> This film was pretty scary for a five year old child. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets and the hypnotic scene of camels .. I don't remember much from this film, of course, the beginning was magical, and some scenes - I wish I could find it again, and I will probably try it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann and Andy.
