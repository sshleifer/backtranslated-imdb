An excellent film. Superb acting of Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as Satin. This film was one of the last mostly "all black" films of the 70s and, unlike the "blaxploitation" films of that era, this film actually had a plot and was very well done. The soundtrack of the film, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R & B charts of the time.
