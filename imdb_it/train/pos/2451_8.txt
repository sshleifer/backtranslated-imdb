George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. The first episodes I saw of this too often made jokes at his mother's expense. Since I've seen more, there has been more and more variety. No one in the cast is really safe from his spirit now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this season has progressed from the fact that George is becoming more comfortable with the role of father of the family sitcom. At first it was not, but it is getting more and more in a furrow. This makes both he and the shows progressively more fun. They had added a couple of characters for George to play again this year. His wife's father is increasingly involved in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central as the past seasons. I think it is prudent to say with George's sense of humor, and the lack of good ABC sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance of being here in ABC long after George W. Bush.
