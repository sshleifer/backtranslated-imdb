This film was fantastic, it's the kind of movie you watch it in and instead of watching other actor films, you watch other director / screenwriter films. Sandler did a good job working a character outside his comfort zone and the always good Cheadle did a great job. This film is great for a mature and intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be overcome by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on real Americans, past generations, stereotypes or racism, only people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing Psychiatry, he defines it, not as someone who heals you magically, but rather through the need to talk about your feelings to an impartial individual you can trust will not judge you, but rather will guide you through your thoughts. This movie is really cool!
