I rented this movie from the blockbuster on a whim .. I like alan arkin and the cover was catching on ... I read the back and I knew immediately that it would be the best or worst movie I've ever seen ... I guess I was lucky. I laughed from start to finish. Alan Arkin brings a great character in this movie. Since then I bought a used rental copy for my collection and I watch it all the time .. I recommended this movie to a lot of people and I enjoyed it as much as I did ... I see complaints about the menus and the DVD function .. but it doesn't take anything away from the movie .. the disc was created for Blockbuster exculsivley and that's why they didn't allow you to skip previews .. apart from that you shouldn't leave the DVD features to keep you from watching the excellent movie .
