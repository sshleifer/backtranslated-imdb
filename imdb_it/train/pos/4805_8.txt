when I heard about this movie I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria I knew this wasn't just a solid movie. Almost everything in this film is fantastic, the costumes are really fantastic and the settings are also beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me are the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the protagonist of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this film proves to be a great actress and to choose a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost as insipid as Prince Albert but has great skill with Emily Blunt. Even Paul Bettany is as solid as Lord Melbourne, although I expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have secondary roles but they can be forgotten. <br /> <br /> For me the film seems unfinished. The writers may have changed too much in the script, I don't know, but that's what I think about the film. <br /> <br /> But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a great performance by Emily Blunt.
