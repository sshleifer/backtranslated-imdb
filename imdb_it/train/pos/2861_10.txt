I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching it together. It teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and fun way (albeit with a rather predictable history most of the time). It's also fun to tease ... you know, rewind and enter your personal dialogue instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I have my DVR set to record all the episodes and I happened to get the tail of an episode (just before the next one that starts ... so I don't know which episode it was) but there is it was an absolutely TERRIBLE sequence error! Adam had given the Sheriff Coffee a small sample of "leather", which had been torn from an outlaw's coat as he tried to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy happened to have the coat, so he spread it out on his desk and put the sample exactly where it was torn. The sample was EXACTLY rectangular ... and I imagine it would be almost impossible to tear a piece of skin (Naugahyde after 1950? Yes. Skin? I don't think so). Well, the champion is perfectly aligned and the mystery has been solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the coat again, still lying on Roy's desk. But this time the sample is more similar to the shape of North Carolina and is now in a COMPLETELY different place on the mantle (but it is still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was exactly in the middle of the sample) now is gone ... how is the seam in the coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over again! It's perfect for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Anyway we still love the show and the mistakes of the sequence make it very funny!
