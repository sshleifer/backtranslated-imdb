I remember seeing this movie, the thought was so interesting. I really wanted to know what will happen next. I was amazed at how much they could fit into an 8-minute short. Let's start in a school yard. . Two friends are discussing the jumping lesson. Kid B tells Kid A "Let's not go to class today". And Kid A declines, claiming he can lose something really important. So baby B skips and baby A goes to class. When he arrives there, the teacher informs him that today they would learn the one and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were about to learn the meaning of life. He gives everyone a brochure, and when it comes to baby A, he runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the child won't share, so Kid A goes to look for the teacher. When he finally finds it, he gets a shocking revelation about what the true meaning of life is. I suggest everyone to look at this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important that it could help you throughout your life.
