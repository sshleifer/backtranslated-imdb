Hook or Crook is an extraordinarily innovative film by a pair of immensely intelligent and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style, and it is beautifully captured by Ann T. Rosetti, and wonderfully written - truly poetic. <br /> <br /> The main characters are true heroes and serve as a rare type of model / inspiration for dams and transes around the world. This film has so much energy, so much poignant passion and its bleak heart of San Francisco. I can't recommend it well enough! <br /> <br /> The best butch friendly film of all time!
