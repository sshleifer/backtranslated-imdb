I bought this game on an impulse purchase from walmart. I'm glad I did it. It was a lot of fun listening to Sean Connery and playing. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a remake of movies / games. Bonus levels were very difficult! The sniper I think was too difficult, it made me so frustrated that I didn't play for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the update system. I did not notice any difference from the outdated equipment to the upgraded one, for example the purchase of an armor enhancement did not seem to make the armor stronger or fuller in my life meter. I really liked the Q helicopter. I think the developers did a good job.
