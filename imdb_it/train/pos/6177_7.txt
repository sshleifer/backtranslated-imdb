SPIRIT's adaptation of Will Eisner on the television screen has followed many other offers developed from comics or comics. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium) It is really ironic that this is the one and only adaptation (as at the time of this writing) of Eisner's smart alec, wise superhero, ironic superhero. <br /> <br /> The story has it that Republic Pictures was interested in making a film version and was in talks with the copyright owner in the mid-1940s, but was never able to close the deal. The game on the left screen became the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in the Republic. Maybe it was just as good, because that studio had a weakness for tinkering with material adapted from comics, pulp magazine, radio and comics. <br /> <br /> As for this 1987 TV movie, it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed TV series. Considering that an old comic book reader, for a long time, like me, can be a bit harsh in criticizing an adaptation, a viewer who doesn't know the character might be able to give some new observations, sheltered from any preconceived idea of what this version of the screen should look like. <br /> <br /> Well, as I sit and watch the story unfold, with the characters interacting between a crime wave, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) nailed him with a statement. "This cannot be decided if he is serious or not!" This pretty well describes both THE SPIRIT and its creator, Will Eisner, the true creative genius in comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on the screen. The casting of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really well done. Although in a contemporary context, it was still in the tradition of the "good old days" as far as costumes are concerned, you know, when men and women still wore hats! This brings out this last (and tortuous) point, namely that the director and the production made a conscious effort and managed to give the characters a look at Will Eisner regarding facial expressions and body language. Let's say, congratulations to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's just a pity that no series followed! Oh, well in today's movie world, comic adaptations seem to be a hot item. Perhaps some great producers and directors of timers could make a first-class SPIRIT production for the big screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 06/04/2008. By now, all those who go to the cinema at the Multiplex shopping center have seen the poster publicize the new film by THE SPIRIT, (subtitled, MY CITY SCREAMS); which will be released on Christmas Day, 2008. Well then we'll see just what we were talking about. Keep your fingers crossed! TO CONTINUE ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw the new movie, directed by THE SPIRIT screenwriter / director Frank Miller a couple of days ago. Well, we got our wish; but this is a good thing or another case of "Be careful what you ask, why could you get it?" Please read our article published elsewhere on IMDb.com. Thank you!
