This show is wonderful. It has some of the best writings I've ever seen. He has a brilliant direction by Dvid Trainer who also directed another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is without doubt one of the biggest. Like THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and the famous COSBY SHOW this will be on television for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> From the perfect jokes to the great performances that you would just like to dream about is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and people who did not live. This show appeals to the young and the young at heart. A perfect show.
