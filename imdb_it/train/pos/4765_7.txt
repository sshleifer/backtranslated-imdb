A priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This film is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In the post-war period, France also regards the mortal aspect of Faith itself. <br /> <br /> This may not be the film of a lifetime, but it is a shame to have allowed it to fall by the wayside. Furthermore, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
