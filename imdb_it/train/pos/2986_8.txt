I am amazed to see even a boy who criticizes this old film. Normally we do not get good opera films, and here is a real great opera. Understandably, the images are not great. It's old. But as a work it cannot be lawful; and I'm an opera buff. I can't even detect lip-synching; if we didn't know that Tebaldi was in the audio nothing would have convinced me that it wasn't Sophia Loren. She does EVERYTHING with style! His dark make-up is fine; and brought the role into the wonderful life! The rest of the cast is wonderful, as is the extraordinary group of ballets. Most of the actors are excellent; Loren really wonderful. Even his rival Amneris is fantastic. Anyone who has not been interested in this work of 1953 is shamefully negligent. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
