This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is exceptional, the music is as good as the film and the murderer is as disturbing as it can be! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him the film would lack a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that haunts her until she finds her friends seriously murdered at home, which is obviously one of the best scenes in the film. You do a tremendous performance. I loved this movie since it scared me in hell when I saw it in the early 80s and I still watch it until today because it's a wonderful movie that lets you enter this world where you could be gutted like a fish every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a madman in a mask that has escaped from an asylum and is ready to kill anyone in sight without them having any idea of ​​being there is simply terrifying and gives you even more movies like events even if the fiction could easily become reality. We all know that unfortunately evil exists in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not rare, a very disturbing fear for all this. Death at any time. Obviously Halloween shows it in its most terrifying way. The horror should be credible, and that's what makes the movie fun. It's just a simple story that turns into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. In addition to the superb Psycho storyline, which I love both, I think the formats are the best horror has to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I'll watch them all my life and I'll never get tired of them. Halloween is without doubt one of the best films of all time.
