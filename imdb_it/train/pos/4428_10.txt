I absolutely must disagree with the other comment regarding this film. The visual effects complete the supernatural themes of the film and does not detract from the plot, I also loved how this move was different from Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no constraints and most of the time it is possible to see the action close. <br /> <br /> I think the western public will be very confused with 2 scenes, one of which is about a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other about the villagers singing which is the end of the world . The scenes mentioned derive from some interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene is a whim of the Japanese calendar ... people then really thought the world would come until the end ... Gojoe has the action, the plot and the images to hypnotize every viewer. I firmly believe that with some skillful modifications it can be sold in the United States. My only complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything - sorry).
