Although some reviews are distinctly Luke-Warm, I found the story totally compelling and although some critics have described the love story as "Mills and Boon", so what? It's nice to see a warm and moving story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and dabbing their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are passionate about each other, even if, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. But I felt that Sir John Conroy, who desperately wanted to control the young queen, is perhaps interpreted as a pantomime villain. As it is said that it was actually the true father of Victoria (as a result of a relationship with his mother, the Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, trapped in the suffocating palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. It brilliantly illustrates the strength of character and the determination that eventually made Victoria a great queen of England, who prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure a great success for this most entertaining and wonderful movie.
