I have never heard of the book, nor am I interested in reading it, but the film will probably see many times. <br /> <br /> This film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest images I've ever seen in a movie. It was like looking at paintings many times, which I think was the idea. <br /> <br /> Terrifying films, history, actors and cinematography. Full of deep emotions from every angle. Although I don't particularly love love films, I loved it and deeply touched Winona Ryder's appeal to his father towards the end. <br /> <br /> Irons deserved an award for his performance and Close never went better. <br /> <br />
