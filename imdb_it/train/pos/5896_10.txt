A truly fantastic film and a true story. Dan Jansen the greatest skater ever. A touching and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens fights with cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. Of an important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right to believe in his talent in speed skating was justified. This image is worth the time. I wish they would have made more films of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with excellent actors and an excellent story. It is a very moving story about beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and sister.
