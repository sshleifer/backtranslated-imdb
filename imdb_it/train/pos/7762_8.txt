In his autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie told her that he shouldn't have made films as stupid as this or something. At that time, Douglas Sirk was labeled "whining for women", in fact, it was restored to favor, except in Europe, after he stopped directing. And when he shot "written on the wind", Sirk had only three films to make: "Angeli appannati", "A time to love and a time to die", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "Imitation of life" (1960 ). Then there was silence. In reality the characters of Bacall and Hudson do not interest Sirk. They are too straight, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone - who was a kind of substitute for her former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack provide the plot's main interest. built continuously, most of the film is a long flashback. The instability of his brother and sister, from a family of wealthy Texan oil owners, is brought to the forefront by bright clothes and glowing cars that go at full speed in a landscape tower. The metamorphosis of Malone at the end of the film is stunning: suit and chignon, playing with a small tower: it is ready for life, the rebel is domesticated. Now alone, because he lost Hudson (but in any case, he was not in love with her). This end is a bit reactionary, but melodrama is a reactionary par excellence, three years later, in "imitation of life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be accused because she does not know her place.
