Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans (who is also known as the front man of the rock debut film 'dEUS'). Entirely shot in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on a sunny Friday morning and jumps rather superficially among the events that fill the day with a dozen main characters. When the film ends, you have a lot of things to think about, because most of the different lines of the story are left open. <br /> <br /> The film has a sound track (purely instrumental) that will make your stocking vibrate away. In most scenes, the music really improves the general atmosphere and the feeling, making the movie really shocking to watch at certain times. The main scene of the film, the party, is very well shot. <br /> <br /> The director has not hesitated to use video clip techniques, having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks I've heard lately. <br /> <br /> The script is excellent. The angles and colors of the camera are chosen very well. The 'costumes' are very hot and also very 'seventy'. And I loved (most) acting. <br /> <br /> The thing I liked most about the film, are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical intertwining. <br /> <br /> Without claiming to be a comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy, but rather an alternative work of art), it still manages to make the audience laugh and even burst out laughing at times. <br /> <br /> This is another directorial debut that should not be a final. I hope to see more Tom Barman films in the future because I enjoyed it. Greetings.
