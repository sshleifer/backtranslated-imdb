Marion Davies stars in this extraordinary comedy "Show People" published by MGM in 1928. Davies plays the role of Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy they come in is a hoot - as is Davies, a scandalous southern costume. Davies finds a job in slapstick comedy, not what he wants, but brings his success. He meets the other slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately hit by her. Well, Davies then gets a job in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and finds a job in period pieces. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the strings of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons his friend and father slapstick for the good life, but of course he learns that he is not who he really is. Marion Davies is wonderful in everything, while she - shockingly - manages the range of emotions required by a "serious" actress. William Haines is the usual usual comedian, and there are cameos of Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the moment, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent film with few "sound effects" since the sound images were just coming. A film treasure.
