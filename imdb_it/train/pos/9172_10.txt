I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and it left an amazing impression on me. Here is a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and a will of her own. His story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we looked at the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it shocked me. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who played the characters were simply fantastic. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, with the name of Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. (Rochester's other interpretations in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion, energy and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately. I say Timothy Dalton is the best because he has all these features in his interpretation of Rochester. Clarke not only does she look like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature brilliantly, holding her emotions, like the Jane of the book, in the appropriate moments of the story, but lets her fire come out in Jane's passionate scenes. The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton interpret in their scenes together is also credible and faithful to the devoted relationship of Jane and Rochester.) Furthermore, secondary actors adapt perfectly to their roles, and the sets adapt to the gothic nature of the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of the classic story by Bronte. If you haven't read the book yet, you can look at this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
