This film was excellent. I didn't expect it to live up to all the fuss but it was. Like all Bourne films, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you enjoyed the other two films in the trilogy, you will love this one too. The plot of the film is simple and there are not too realistic twists. OK, the character of Julia Stiles appearing in the Italian safe was a bit far-fetched especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she's the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows, who doesn't want him dead and he could trust and the only person to guide him in the right direction. The action is driven by the characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. The thing I've always loved about Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick his ass, but when he matches good people like him, the fights are fights and he suffers a lot of damage. They never treat the public like idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I believe that Damon can play Bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from Joan Allen who resumes his role from Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. However I miss Franka Potente.
