It's amazing how this movie drags you. I did honest laughter. It doesn't matter that it's low budget because it works for me. To be honest, my wife didn't do it the same way, but she prefers a different kind of film. He admitted though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a string of shoes. These characters whose lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my world. Keep going and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. Watching this film a second and a third time I realized that there are some hidden moments that have passed for the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with a certain complexity. However I liked it. I hope to see more.
