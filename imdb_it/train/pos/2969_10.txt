This film is about two guys who invented a sport on the spot trying to get 2 girls. BASEketball becomes a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but he is hated when he loses the NBA in some other rival team. Meet the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth and they finally kiss. the first time I saw this movie I got my pants wet it was so much fun. a must see for all comedy fans. If you love South Park you'll like it! Perhaps not looking with children is a bit inappropriate for little guys. some boys give 6 1/2 out of ten, I give them 11 out of ten. i like coop he rocks I have to bye bye thanks for reading this
