First of all; I'm a passionate Modesty fan, and I've read the comics since I was a child, and I found the previous films about our unsatisfactory heroine, but where they fail, this ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, here we are: Ms Blaise works for a casino, a gang of robbers arrives and starts playing for her friends' lives. If the thief wins a round, he will have to tell him about himself. If he wins twice in a row, one of the staff members is free. (It sounds silly, yes, well, I'm not so good at explaining ...);) <br /> <br /> She tells him to grow up in a war zone, without parents or friends, to help her grow old in the field refugees and how they flee, living according to the rules of nature. They hunt for food, and he teaches them to read and fight. As they approach civilization they are captured in a war, and while they are taken for rebellions, they are hit and the old man dies, who leaves her to meet the city alone. <br /> <br /> So he meets the man he's working for the casino, and the story ends there. <br /> <br /> What you need to follow is that there is a fantastic fight and the line is absolutely fantastic. Alexandra Staden is a modesty TERRIFIC Blaise! Equally modest and strong, graceful and intellectual like that of the comic strip. <br /> <br /> It seems embarrassing, however, to hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but this is not relevant since the comics cannot speak loudly, but certainly must have a slightly existing accent. (Not to mention that it's strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans ..) <br /> <br /> The acting is really good, even the child who plays the young Blaise must have applause! <br /> <br /> My favorite part must be where the dress is torn to kick the stupid thief's ass! Absolutely amazing! : D I'm looking forward to the real adventure in the next movies! <br /> <br /> Look at it, you won't be disappointed!
