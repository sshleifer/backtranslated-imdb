This film is the first in the trilogy of Miikes' trilogy, and the trilogy starts a great start. The films in the trilogy are linked only thematically, and these themes are actually evident in all his films, if you look closely enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his little brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of strangers, making his way to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The younger brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming more and more needy than one, as the movie progresses. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore rather violent and hard. Miike has done worse, but since this is a serious film, it hits you a lot. As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this. The film is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a big boost and real determination. If you've only seen Miikes movies (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth a try because it's a sort of compromise between his aggressive and extravagant style shown in those movies and his more serious side, as seen in other films from the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will NEVER forget (look and understand what they are for you). <br /> <br /> 8/10
