dear god, where do I start? this is not the best film I've ever seen. the camera angles are fantastic but in my opinion the acting was the best. because the writers of this film are not writing big-budget films I will never understand. another is the cast. it's big. this is definitely the best ted raimi film. I know some of you out there are probably thinking "in no way has much better" but they're not wrong. raptor island is a work of art. I hope he should have gotten the best film of the year instead of that lousy Crash movie with a bunch of names and no raptors. I think this film is really the most wonderful thing ever.
