In my opinion, this film is, despite its flaws (which I claim to be * a few *), an absolute masterpiece and a great and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create an absolutely beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. He does not receive 1/100 of the credit he deserves for having literally saved the art of animation for an adult audience. If it wasn't for Mr. Bakshi, I don't think the animation would have survived the onslaught of Disney. Moreover, with The Lord of the Rings, he not only created a beautiful animated film, but created a completely new art form, unfortunately one that never managed to take off. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the movie (the use of live action images that are used as background images and often animated using various techniques from what appear to be small amounts of coloring for full-scale animation). But I feel that people who complain simply cannot accept an art form that is out of the ordinary. No, this is not Disney animation. No, it's not a live action. No, it's not "cheating" - what it is is a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic fairy tale like "The Lord of the Rings". Bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of the mid-earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darkest of Tolkien's creatures, particularly the Nazgul, is realized in a way that the Traditional animation or live action have not been able to achieve. <br /> <br /> The script by Peter S. Beagle (based very little, as I understand it, on an initial draft by Chris Conkling) is a very faithful adaptation of Tolkien's works. Where possible, use dialogue directly from the novel and feel at home in the world that Bakshi created. There are many cuts that have been made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour and 15 minute movie, but there are very few plot changes. There are some holes that it would have been nice to have filled: Narsil's refugio, Galadriel's gifts, the Huorns at the Battle of Hornburg, but, again, with the time limits he had (already the longest animated feature in history), these are certainly understandable (although one wonders how they could have been explained in a following). <br /> <br /> Also there is the delicious (one of my favorites) Leonard Rosenman score (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (whose score is clearly based on his LotR work)). It is bold and bold and, I dare say, perfect. It is based on itself as an orchestral triumph, but when coupled with the images of the film, it enters a completely new world of symphonic perfection. So far from the typical Hollywoodland fare that turns many people off. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. Of particular note is John Hurt in the role of Aragorn who exudes only the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character design is also wonderfully unique, although not often for everyone's taste. But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he / she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so Aragorn is made with a distinctive Native American touch and Boromir appears as inspired by the Vikings. Maybe that's not what you imagined, but I can only applaud Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he "saw". It could also be noted that he spent a considerable amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing character outfits for the film. <br /> <br /> A word further away: the Flight to the Ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the finest subtleties that have ever been captured on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment, and his mastery is clearly demonstrated by the incredible tension he is able to build. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's incredible work merge in this sequence to a glorious peak that has yet to be equaled. <br /> <br /> The recent Warner Brothers DVD (2001) is definitely lacking. While we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen, the package is terribly short of extras. How glorious it would have been to have a comment from the director, to have been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that was removed for theatrical release. Another delightful addition could have been the editing of the live movie which was then animated above. Also present in the DVD version is the absolutely horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover that occurred in the final frames of the film. This version is plastered and rendered ill right above the musical apex of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy is that the sequel was never realized. We will never be able to see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, Cracks of Doom, Eowyn's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him. We will never be honored with the image of Bakshi of Denethor or Palatir or the Paths of the Dead. It is a pity beyond all shame that, in the end, we will have to accept the glitz and glitter of Peter Jackson, the film version of these latest events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I suppose it's better than not having a film version at all. <br /> <br /> David
