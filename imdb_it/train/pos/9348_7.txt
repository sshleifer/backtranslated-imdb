What we have here is a situation. A man finds himself in trouble and people want to help him, in contrasting ways. In the end they are forced to give up. You can't fix people. And although in various aspects Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood, that message is not. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane that has entered an almost psychotic state of PTSS ever since. It's about the meeting that Charlie does with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a New York dentist who was his roommate at the dental school and, knowing his tragedy, identifies him on the street and reconnects. Charlie is riding on a small motorized toy scooter - an imaginative contraption for negotiating Manhattan traffic - with big headphones on a mass of unruly hair. Hair is Sandler's main head to show that he is unbalanced. And the use of music as an escape must hit all the iPod subway pilots. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically Alan, blocked by a controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon starts to envy him. Charlie lives as a teenage bad boy with a huge trust fund (insurance money from the tragedy), and starts to drag Alan to "go out", "eat Chinese", buy records, or watch a Mel Brooks marathon in a house of rest. Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a bad hostess, redoing the kitchen over and over again, collecting old Springsteen, Who, etc. vinyls, and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a large empty living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him, but also somewhat resentful, as we will learn later. Alan has a new patient who is proposing him. Charlie's despair shows us Alan. Trying to help Charlie in part allows Alan to escape his stifling reality, but partly makes him more acutely aware of them. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler make a strange pair, but it does not matter, because it is convincing that both may need each other. Charlie is desperate for the company of a friend who has never met his family, because to escape his loss, he pretends he never had one. So if as a roommate Charlie slept naked and slept while walking and had a terrible musical taste (no Motown)? Alan wants an escape from his orderly and demeaning life. He is under the thumb not only of his wife but of his dental partners, who dominate him even though he is the one who set up the practice. They are white, by the way, and he is black. <br /> <br /> There is also the lascivious patient of hell, who seriously destroys things in the dental offices, but starts to look different when Charlie arrives and notices that she is a Babe. His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any time. He is also attracted to the bosom of Liv Tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who start trying to treat Charlie when he admits he may need help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's crazy scenes are a bit too theatrical, like many plot devices (in fact this film seems like a game at more than one point), but it has several monologues in which it expresses its pain in ways that are deeply touching. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not only delirious and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all these efforts to help him start to backfire. The film is admirable in the way it conveys the feeling that people cannot be done well. This is an interesting film - sometimes touching - and it is the first time that 9/11 has been faced in terms of suffering for the survivors. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes seems bland, many of the people are drawn too widely, and the overly large interiors of Hollywood have a terrible decor; only the streets of Manhattan seem real. There is a court scene that is absurd, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is solved too easily with a phone call. Yet it is worth looking for acting - the control and subtlety of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in P.T. Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, although this is clearly a better film, in fact much better.
