Being a fan of giant monsters, seeing "Yeti" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the cheap bootleg, I managed to find a copy quite easily, and I was happily surprised to see that this film was actually, I would say, decent. <br /> <br /> Decent for what it is, actually, that is to say a shot of a giant cheese monster. It starts quickly with Yeti, which is found almost immediately, and are introduced to us in various characters. They are made up of some dingy, some good, and a girl who is practically one of the most surprisingly beautiful girls in all the silly sci-fi type films by far. <br /> <br /> Yeti looks like a long-drawn boy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and in reality, he's not that bad of a boy, especially after being introduced to the world in a kind of funky stuff like a cage. Godzilla is not - despite his rude awakening, he is not unleashed (in reality he rarely destroys anything in the whole film), but he seems only perplexed as he tries to understand things. Yeti seems to understand English quite well (my copy was dubbed in English) and knows who the good and the bad are. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti do its duty, and he is practically in the whole film, and in the typical low-budget fashion, the size seems to change a lot depending on the scene and there are also a lot of "false feet" of him right there standing. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not the best, but there are certainly some good ones here. A scene in which Yeti smashes a warehouse is done very well, and in another it uses the windows of a building as "ladders" to descend from the top of it - shattering every window with its foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in a sequence that looks really, really much better than it should in a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never bends to say "APE" does it. Actually, the only time it comes close to real stupidity is when the pretty girl raises Yeti's nipple and raises her eyebrow in an "oh yes, baby" way. But even this is not so bad, and somehow you get a laugh from the viewer. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly it doesn't get boring - the story is really good, and watching this wonderful actress on the screen will make any male spectator happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be at the top of giant monster movies, but it is definitely better than other King Kong '76 imitations such as "APE" and "Queen Kong" from far away.
