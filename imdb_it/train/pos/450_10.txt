I am prejudiced against any film that depicts a lush picture of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately the film was quite short, unusually so for a period piece, and a bit sparse on film. However, the excellent history makes up for it. The four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems in their mind. In the course of the film, they understand their problems and begin to solve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle in which they live, has an enchanting effect on people. "It's a tub of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can observe their gradual transition from dissatisfied to exuberant, while the Italian sea works its magic on them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are plausible. The actresses were fantastic. The background music seemed very appropriate for a romantic Italian venue. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
