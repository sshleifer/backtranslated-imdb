"Insignificance" is a far from exceptional film, from a theatrical show, directed by Nic Roeg. In Roeg's film scheme, this is above the level of most of her post-work "Don't Watch Now", which is characterized by Theresa Russell's judicious use as a leading actress. Actually she is very good here, and far from the problem in other Roeg films like "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As an "actress", which is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, interpreting her as a deeply depressive but nice siren. Sounds good with Michael Emil in the role of Einstein, which to say the least is excellent. Look at the part admirably, and while Theresa Russell doesn't look exactly like Monroe, it is certainly attractive enough to make the part authentic. The other players are adequate if not quite as bold as Emil and Russell are. A nice and functional script is well directed by Roeg, but certainly not brilliantly, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other films of successive Roegs, it tends to rely too much on vague and inconsistent flashbacks, which add very little to the film. In many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter piece (for example, 60 minutes), more modest. Yet an acceptable, acceptable film. Sometimes quite excellent, but a little lacking overall. Evaluation: - *** 1/2 / *****
