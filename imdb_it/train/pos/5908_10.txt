This is one of the most brilliant films I've seen in recent times. It goes well beyond any international film of any reputation. I am really surprised because this did not receive the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact. Renuka Daftardar simply amazes as she speaks through her eyes. There are some scenes that stand out: when Gauri returns from the city for Krishna's marriage, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but there is no single line of dialogue. The whole range of emotions is transmitted through subtle mannerisms and eyes. There is another towards the end when Krishna invokes Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If you're not touched by that scene, you don't have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie for sheer brilliance and acting ability.
