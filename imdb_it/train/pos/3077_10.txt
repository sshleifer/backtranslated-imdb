I lost the entire show season and started watching it on the ABC website during the summer of 2007. I'm absolutely crazy about the show. I think the whole cast is excellent. It's one of my favorite programs ever. I just checked the ABC program lineup this fall and didn't see it on the program. This is really sad. I hope they bring him back ... maybe they're waiting for Bridget Moynahan to have her baby? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments posted on the show and I see many glowing observations similar to mine. I really hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will take it back.
