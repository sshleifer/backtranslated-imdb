I saw the first part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course the two parts are worlds apart, so I'm a little shaken by everything I've just seen. I felt consumed by the awareness of the inevitability of Che's death; for me, it has blurred the whole movie. I suppose that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to hear, the inevitable evolution of his death. The second part was so late compared to, once again inevitable, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia has only been hinted at but rarely addressed in terms of teaching. For me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the clash with the jailer and the lightest chatter with the Bolivian official in which those official questions about Che the failure of peasants to support his revolution. I had not considered national differences to play the role they had in the conflict, Argentine versus Bolivian. I thought that Soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how to get food without antagonizing peasants who do not have enough. I was struck by how difficult it would be to try something like Che tried it. I guess it's all in the timing; there is enough anger against the government to start the movement; in Bolivia it wasn't there. Who made the terrible corundum of the revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film: if not now, when, 50 years from now. A very stimulating and well-made film; make every effort to see it.
