Maturity movies are quite common these days. For 1980, "Volpi" really gives its meaning. Jodie Foster plays the character directly. Since he did "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, he has a stronger character in this film. She is Jeanie, a high school girl who has a lot of courage, and seems to get out of every situation she is in. Scott Baio plays Brad before Chachi in "Happy Days". He is considered immature by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanged with the wrong crowd, chased by her cop's father. Jeanie and her other three friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party becomes totally out of control. Exploring life on the other side of the slopes can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad all the time whenever she is wasted. The reality returns difficult where she is killed in a car accident. And one marries a much older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In reality, you have to be careful about the people around you. For me, I was my person, and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great plot, this film is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
