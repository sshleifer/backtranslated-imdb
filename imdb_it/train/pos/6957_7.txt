My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a funny movie no more or less. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and quiet. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and connects with her. At the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be OK, but then Matt finds out that she is G-Girl. At first this looks really nice for Matt but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break up with her and connect with his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and she starts revenge on her ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I liked most in the film are the scenes in which G-Girl takes revenge on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role for her character in the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who loves a pleasant comedy.
