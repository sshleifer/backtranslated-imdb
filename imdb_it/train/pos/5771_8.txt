This is one of those movies that you happen to see when you do a navigation channel on a Saturday afternoon, and you attract and end up watching the whole thing. I thought it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters. Although it is a bit slow, focusing more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it never became boring. We don't really see too much of all the robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead most of the shootings take place when an ambush is held up to the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with her character. Moving from a beautiful country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a difficult thing to portray, and I liked the subtlety that led to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, an above-average effort, especially considering it was a fact for TV movies.
