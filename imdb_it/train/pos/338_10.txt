I saw this film at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam and I had the privilege of meeting both directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are lively and outspoken New Yorkers. The title of the film in Amsterdam was Keep the river on your right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism a little less prominent. Equally important was the love and gay relationship that Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at almost 80 years and the inevitable renunciation were moving. I can only recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.
