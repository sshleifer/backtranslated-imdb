The third and, in my opinion, the best in the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character in the previous series, but Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is aptly ridiculous at laughing line. <br /> <br /> As a package is quality through and through convincing regency sets, superb sharp sarcasm and small wacky pieces, prominent 'macbeth' actors and the impression of Prince Georges' lucky chicken and the missing words of Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies have been as clever as they are amusing, ok, the strange observation or limping line arrives but above all it is a scream.
