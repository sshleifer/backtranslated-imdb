This is what makes me proud to be English. This is by far the most fun thing on TV. The championship consists of Jeremy Dison, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the adorable Reece shearsmith. Totally underrated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the bizarre slogans, "Hi Dave". It is a comedy that everyone simply has to watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the gentlemen's series is that it is always fresh and that it always pushes the boundaries. He does not need to rely on slogans (unlike little Britain) to be fun. the fact that the championship is likely to kill their most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they have steel balls.
