Babyface - The infamous Barbara Stanwyck film where she is told by the local professor who has the power - tries to make her read Nietzche - says that the books have never hurt her. We find that his father is fundamentally his out to a local politician and others. He finally had enough and moved to the big city. We follow his trail of men on the ladder of success in an international bank. The dialogue is brazen enough for his time and was one of the last films released before the Hollywood self-inflicted production code. Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims. Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I saw the extended version - the DVD has both more Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge versions. An interesting film that prefigures the future roles of the femme fatale that Stanwyck would have interpreted in the era of noir. B +
