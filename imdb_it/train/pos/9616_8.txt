It is worth looking at it twice because of the rapid causal changes to several compelling stories, "Bug" emerges as a completely satisfying work of art that interprets the always optimistic love against a myriad of examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch) whose overriding concern for life - from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers he is partially responsible for - frames the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited confidence in fortune cookie messages: "You will meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> Against this optimism there are the forces of bizarre reality, all generated by the character's actions: parking tickets, a clogged drain in a Chinese food / donut shop, a TV outage, a fender crushed car, a booking canceled for dinner which eventually results in cancellation of a Hawaiian vacation. <br /> <br /> The film is funny: Olive is getting drunk at a Chippendale performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative trying to deal with an irate client, the obsessive Cyr (Brian Cox) of in front of a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) who reacts to his girlfriend refusing to have children writing fortunes of hostile Chinese cookies: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the guy who falls asleep while maneuvering a jackhammer because he passed night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat. <br /> <br /> A minor story with cabl public The access host (Darryl Theirse) and a local acting teacher who reads "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" entertains more or less the same level as "trains, planes and cars" but with a lower budget and a fresher eye.
