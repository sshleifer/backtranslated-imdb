When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in Science. I brought a girl - friend to see him a second time. I don't think she was as impressed as me! This film was comical but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were rather new. The lessons of this film could be applied to issues relating to today's GM experimentation.
