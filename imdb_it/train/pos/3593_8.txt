Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with an insolent frown and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight anyone, especially her father who is paying for his brother's boxing lessons. Diana decides that boxing would be a good way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. See how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the square circle.
