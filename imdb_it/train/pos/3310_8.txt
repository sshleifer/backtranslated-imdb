In the film Kongwon-do iti presents a relatively intimate look at the significance (as well as the lack of general sense) in the lives of the various Koreans; empty people seek ways to fill themselves, enjoying escape from nature. From the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn their shortcomings and desires, the overall complexity captured in human life (and yet the excessive simplicity of humanity). Although the film is slow, it can be very contemplative. It does not force any idea, but allows ideas to be realized on their own, allowing concepts to reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> The film ends like this and suddenly how it starts, and one truly understands the meaning of loneliness, that love is often an act of selfishness, and the many mistakes we make. It is a look in everyday life, very well done and well done. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action or an intense drama, this is not the right movie for you. However, if you like honest, original and meaningful films that are not forced and without pomp, this is a great movie to watch.
