Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos, but gets a little shrill. Donald Moffat is also monotonous as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is excellent as quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, bringing the film to most of its critical points. It fills the time nicely, but it's little more than that.
