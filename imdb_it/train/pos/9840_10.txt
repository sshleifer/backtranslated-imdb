Born Again the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man could come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in the head of a little girl <br /> <br /> Vendetta would get <br /> < br /> For the murder you encountered <br /> <br /> From the boy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me Born Again is a very underestimated classic episode that is a part of what he called X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw some segments before when the show first came and I was too young to watch it as part of the movie The Jersey Devil, but I remember in particular that this episode was 11 years old and I was absolutely scared of the scene where the boy is suffocated to death from the bus and then the scene of hypnosis with the child. I tell you I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepy factor that I have cultivated since then to enjoy. It is enough to make me look beyond some of the obvious flaws in the plot, like why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous spirit of life really began to demand her revenge. Or what he was doing randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think his parents would have been worried. And maybe it was just that we didn't really see that part of the story. And was it with telekinesis? In addition to adding the really interesting Carrie factor to the already gruesome story, there really was no good explanation for this. But even with its small flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and has no reason for me not to like it. 10 out of 10.
