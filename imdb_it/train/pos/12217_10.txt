I went to see Ashura in 2005 as Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Friend, it was a nice kick-off. The director should have been in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons, he's still in Japan ... oh, sir, I hope he's improving and doing a lot of other films. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, but quite original ... the demons roam Edo in Japan and the Swordsman called "Demon Wardens" are killing them and they fear the rebirth of Ashura, the goddess of demons who sleeps and presumably is very strong. <br /> <br /> It takes us to Izumo ... a kind of elite swordsman called "Demon Slayer" and his friend Jaku who is the typical violent jealous jerk ... <br /> <br /> Does it seem boring? Well now it thickens .... <br /> <br /> Izumo has taken his retirement from killing demons since he killed a boy with the impression that he was the demon, he never knew, but he killed her. So Izumo continued his life and recycled himself in the Kabuki theater. On a boat trip on a beautiful night, Izumo sees a girl hiding on a bridge and changes her life and starts killing demons again ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and damn ... the boy knows how to handle a sword and throw a funny massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo brings the film with regards to the game ... it's the complete package ... he knows how to fight (hell you know), he's witty, he's smart and has that grit. You never have to shout: "NO IZUMO, IT'S A TRAP" The boy already knows he has that common sense. He really is the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As far as cinematography is concerned, aesthetics is quite interesting. It is by far the film that looks more like a manga. It is full of special effects and nothing, at all costs, will prevent this film from appearing realistic ... it's really surprising. A lot of colors and an "unreal" photograph, in addition to this ... it's pretty simple ... but like I said, the main character is bringing the movie To See, a story guided by masterful hands
