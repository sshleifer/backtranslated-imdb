Riding Giants is an incredible documentary that tells the story and stories of three influential big wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did a great job assuming the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. The film's structure has been brilliantly modified and works perfectly with storytelling, interviews, animation and surfing shots. The soundtrack of the music only adds to the satisfaction of seeing this film, making the vision of Riding Giants brilliant. The personal highlights include any comment by Greg Noll, with his direct frankness, the filming of Laird Hamilton at Teahupoo and the out-takes at the end of the film. But actually this whole movie is a great recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. It is a sin, it is no longer known, but it is a jewel worthy of attention. 10/10
