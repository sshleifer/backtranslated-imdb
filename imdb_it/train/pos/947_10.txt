and perhaps closer to the Dickens plot. Even though I find the young Ebenezer hard to look at (who has any idea about that hair period, surely he could have done better than that!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. The delivery of some of Dickens' lines eventually made it alive for me. Edward Woodward is all we expect and more than the ghost of the Christmas gift. I find G.C. Scott Scrooge much more than a credible miser than the more current version made by Patrick Stewart. The Christmas Morning scene, when Scrooge realizes he hasn't lost it, is enough to convince someone that Scott knows how to behave in an excessive way. It's phenomenal here. Almost the entire cast is incredible. The Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little hard to watch, almost too sweet. Still the music and the landscape make this a must for every holiday. To enjoy!
