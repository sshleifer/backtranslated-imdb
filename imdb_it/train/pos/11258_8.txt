Spoiler! The 70s classic sex junk! The Swedish girl (Helga) is what made this film so great. She was beautiful, but what really struck me was how sexual she was. He exuded enormous amounts of sexuality throughout the film. His best scenes were when she was, um, he was stimulating himself. Every time he was on the screen, I became paralyzed. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Dr. Julia (sister of the excellent male focus of the film) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls have Julia's biggest breasts, she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes (especially the silk blouse scenes and black skirt) caught my eye without a pity. You also loved the Hoaky scene where the bats stripped his nekkid; I don't know if I've ever seen anything more ridiculous but sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
