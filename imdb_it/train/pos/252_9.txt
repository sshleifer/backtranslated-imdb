The performances were superb, the costumes gave a unique feeling for the period and being a living Victorian historian, I was impressed by the accuracy of the weapons and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I would not say that you need to know Kelly's saga to stay with the flow of this film, but to understand the events and attitudes of the time, you will need some basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some rather stupid people do, that some of the characters have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country in childhood. <br /> <br /> OK, the story had some fictional elements, but these are necessary for a wider continuation of the film. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature of the DVD that he wanted his film to 'inspire an interest', and that's exactly what happened with me, so this movie gets the thumbs up here. <br /> <br /> Watch it and you will NOT regret it
