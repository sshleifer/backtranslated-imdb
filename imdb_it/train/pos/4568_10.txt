Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in a film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their prizes: but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: the clich√© is true here: they do not play the roles, they live there La Day-Lewis performance is a tour de force - a transformation that arouses awe, but it was really a sign of the Academy's intelligence that together with this performance, have also honored Brenda Fricker's splendidly sober, firm and heartbreaking work as a mother of Christie. By the way, if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in "Swann", this is another film that is worth seeing for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
