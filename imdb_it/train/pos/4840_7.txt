I saw the recent DVD of Region 2 of this film displayed in the "horror" section in an Oxford Street store and also advertised as a "classic thriller". It is actually almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his incessantly cheerful, exuberant and essentially good-natured humor comes as a bit of a culture shock for many accustomed to the harsh and cynical taste of much British comedy of the last twenty-five years. However, there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheerful personality and the total absence of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper who often borrowed the "self-strangulation" gag that Arthur attempts to entertain with blocked passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a surprising and rare appearance by the underrated Linden Travers, who has an impact like the mysterious Julie.
