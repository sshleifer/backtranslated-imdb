You can call it a mystery, maybe a little thriller or an intelligent movie. <br /> <br /> History takes you through the life of a person who has lost his life and is trying to recover it. <Br /> <br /> I must say that I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. It's not usually the kind I care about, but the characters quickly became people to me and I wanted to know what it was and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> Just like many French films besides English, we can learn much more about the character and influence of their surroundings on their person. This film is driven by the character and will not disappoint!
