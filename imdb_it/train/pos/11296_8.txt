I had a personal interest in this film. When I was 17 and out of high school I found a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Labor and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc. For one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south to San Diego. Shortly before we stopped at a military base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were chained, we went north, a few miles, to Camp Pendleton, the great marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base. It took about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, trenches with a gun, trenches with sandbags and housing. All this was at very high wages, sometimes "golden time", which was three times our normal hourly wage. Our food was also top quality = ribs for lunch, etc. - which was incredible because it was wartime and very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> Once the work was done I waited anxiously for the film to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited impatiently for up to two hours from the movie before my work finally came on screen. Then there were no more than three or four minutes (perhaps less) than the heroes of the film who bombed the base and blew it to pieces. A little disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I liked the movie and haven't seen it since. Later I learned that this film was signed by the government and Fox was paid with a higher cost, which perhaps explains our extravagant salary and lifestyle there. Bob Weverka
