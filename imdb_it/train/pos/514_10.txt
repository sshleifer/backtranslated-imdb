Surely one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made anywhere. Script, cinematography, direction and acting in a separate class. This film works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Ever shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly presented at London's National Film Theater for crowded houses?
