Enchanting, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, surpassing the "novels of death" better known as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find the ultimate happiness at the end of that long scale, joy is in the journey. The moral of the story, of course, is timeless: love conquers everyone. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a heavenly arena of broad vision and gripping grandeur. With over 500 appropriately appearances depicting various eras and cultures, the directors' vision of the sky remains memorable six decades later, far in the CGI era. <br /> <br /> However, for all cosmic dimensions, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderfully determined and romantic look of "Stairway" is captured with extreme simplicity: the tear of June, preserved on a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.
