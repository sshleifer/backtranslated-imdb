Considering the lack of art with African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and traders. But the funny thing is that this is not the goal or even the topic of the short. But it is the unexpressed affirmation of independence from these themes that is more attacking. The genus is unique and is not the typical expectation. It is almost this departure that attracts attention for the first time, so looking at it twice is fundamental. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the true art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is this true art that is extremely rare with an African voice. The film does not copy to reach its message, it innovates and causes provoking subtle stereotypes (not racial stereotypes but based on characters), from the writers' point of view the film is brilliant. It carries multiple messages that include rapid character development. It should be remembered that this film lasts less than 10 minutes and manages to establish the character very quickly. The use of the color and music plot should also be praised. But considering the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's latest adventure 500 years later, music is predictable. But from the point of view of the theme it seems that the idea is a departure, but the satire indirectly escapes a social problem, brilliant stuff!
