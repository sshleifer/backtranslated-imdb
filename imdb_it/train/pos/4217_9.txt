It is always satisfying when a detective closes a case and the criminal is brought to book. In this case the climax gives me even more pleasure. Seeing the smug smile erased from Abigail Mitchell's face when she realizes that her victim has left the "deathbed testimony" that leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon performance, her character really, * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. It is done in its own way by making an act of "little girl" which is embarrassing in a woman of her age. Worse still, she has now established herself as a judge, jury and executioner against the husband of her dead niece. <br /> <br /> When Columbo is getting too close, he tries to make him nervous by manipulating him to give a speech cuff to an audience of high class women. It perfectly transforms the tables by offering a very warm and humane discourse on the reality of police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from seeking justice. Abby's final appeal to her good nature is rejected because she has too much respect for herself for not doing her job well. Here is a situation that you cannot hesitate from Ms Mitchell!
