This 370-minute film was broadcast on Italian public television in the early 1970s. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer of the Journey, Odysseus's home after the Trojan war. It is an epic story on the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, told to the list 500 years after those events took place, around 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a 1969 film, so if you buy the DVD version I would find that the sound is only mono and there is no other language than Italian, even the caption is in Italian. Pity. Many people would appreciate this masterpiece if it listed the English subtitles. But if this is not a problem for you, I highly recommend watching this movie.
