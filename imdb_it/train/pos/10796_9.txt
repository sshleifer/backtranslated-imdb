If you're a fan of both, both Chuck Norris and Judson Mills, this is the movie to watch. There is a lot of adventures in it. It's a great sequel to Man's President. The chemistry of the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. My personal opinion. This film, along with the original, has gone so well, that networks should consider turning it into a regular series. If you've seen the President's Man, I recommend this movie for you. If you've seen the president's man: a line in the sand but you haven't seen the president's man, then let me suggest you do it. You will not be disappointed by either of them.
