Maybe it's not the biggest entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it definitely wins the prize for the most invented episode from the title! "The House that Bled to Death" ?? I could scream this title all day without ever getting tired! And in addition to the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a solidly written script and a handful of sincere moments of suspense. It may require an extra visualization before fully understanding the particular finishing touch, but it is definitely an original idea for a horror short film. The story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class home. The husband sadistically kills his wife and many years later the "cursed" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubine move and begin to restore it, but mysterious events happen that mainly affect the young Sophie. His beloved cat is killed and even his birthday party is ruined when one of the pipes of the house suddenly sprays blood on all the guests (a particularly chilling sequence, this!). Is the old house really haunted? Or maybe the seemingly useful neighbors cause all the horror? The answers to these questions are given in the original and quite unpredictable climax and there is even room for a real shock at the end. The tension is masterfully built and the owner house is full of scary landscapes, like the pair of rusty machetes used by her husband to kill his wife. However, the sequence with the cat is hard to look at when you're an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner for Hammer's short-lived TV series!
