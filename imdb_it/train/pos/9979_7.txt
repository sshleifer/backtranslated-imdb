To start with, since this film is a remake of a classic, the rating must already be lowered. Since this version sees Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, it helps. <br /> <br /> It is not just like the US government, to terrorize one of its citizens. Looks like the movie's Jason Priestley character! But the truth is, the government would do everything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to go home to his wife. A wife, who is in labor, and may not make it. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the Disc Jockey. <br /> <br /> There have been some great landscape shots in this film, big car chases and a lot of spirituality. After many considerations, I gave this film a 7.
