Roseanne's last season was a crazy roller coaster ride. This final episode does just what a previous comment says, telling us that as far as we could have thought to know the characters we didn't have. Roseanne returns to season one and tells us that this show was her interpretation of her life. She says in this final episode that she has changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott wasn't really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David have married the opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she made him live. As events that happened in his life, he modified them in his writing. We don't all want to be able to do it. We don't all have a time when we just want to be able to use a tire and change at our leisure. This is what he did with the whole episode. And to another comment I would say that I don't feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, it just changed the way events happened in their lives. An A + finale to an A + show !!!!
