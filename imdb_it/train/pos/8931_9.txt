The Intruder (The Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of the film. He follows his spirit through time, space and character. There may be a plot, but what I understood about it I picked up from the description on the cover of the Netflix DVD. Honestly, it's probably better not to know anything about the movie before watching it, because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations. The film requires the viewer to reflect, but also belies the fact that he will not be able to fully understand. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the enigma of the film. Each image questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, that of the spectator and that of Louis. The character of Louis is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character. Honestly, anyone could have played the character of Louis, if he possessed a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. Yet Subor is the one described here; becomes the film, its identity is inseparable from it. Many of the film images that persist in my mind revolve around its expressions, vocal but above all physical. <br /> <br /> The intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the immobility and fullness of movement, but more fluid than any literature in the form he refuses to take. "Surrealist" was used in describing this film, but perhaps "almost realistic" is a more adequate term. Nothing in the film exists outside the possibilities of reality; the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer a few times if you are attracted by visual images; watch the film to see the consequences of the combination of verses and an outlet for freedom.
