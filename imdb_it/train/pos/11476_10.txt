day zero is based on the Colombo high school massacre. and it's a video diary of two boys. at the beginning you don't know what will happen you think it's just a bad student film. until they start talking about the horrible things they will do in this quiet school. until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and shoot in the woods. they have a lot to say about this movie. everyone knows that this film is a film that forgets to watch a movie and watch a real video made by two guys. <br /> <br /> the two boys behave as if they were in a strange cult. they burn all the things there. how to play board games dvd homework school stuff books. these two guys can be all your brother friends or the people you see walking down the street. goes through daily activities (and this is making a gun: in the videos they mention the bullying that happens to them and how people say things about clothes there and the things you are in are not saying it's right but many people do things of the kind. <br /> <br /> and also the fact is that these people are suspected of pleasure for the delicate subject they have chosen for this film. <br /> <br /> my review on day zero . <br /> <br /> and let's just say that the final scene is messed up.
