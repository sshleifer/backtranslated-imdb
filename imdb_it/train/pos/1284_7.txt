I saw The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse's Drive-in Cult Classics (with versions of Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> This film contains a lot of stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual misconduct, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The main actors do a credible job. And I found the plot intricate to be credible and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the supporting cast, first and foremost the motorcyclists, offers a rigged performance, in particular when it is required to provide lines with more than a few words. Maybe they used real bikers instead of actors. A couple of characters, in particular, were exceptionally credible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is absolutely apt, for the times, the time and for advancing the story. I found the music a real pleasure. I noticed in the opening credits that the film was characterized by the music of "The Food", which I searched on Google; but, he couldn't find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey who wrote, produced and acted in this film really liked the idea (of a rebellious married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulations and a little help - obviously) that he wrote, produced and interpreted in "Weekend with the babysitter".
