A gripping drama of four men on a weekend canoe ride down a distant river. I am pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and likeable Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are fantastic - there's the incredible duel banjo sequence, an interesting interaction between the characters and just a splendid widescreen cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond. So two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them raped Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Incredible. The scenery is incredibly beautiful and yet this horrible violence is taking place. To be honest, Beatty's rape never bothered me - I'm aware that he's pretending despite his good acting. This film also shows how the characters change - And he tested his pacifism, Lewis weakens, Bobby is raped by one of the people he mocked earlier and Drew tries to stay sane. Even the direction of John Boorman is very reassuring and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly good. Voight is just OK in the head - it was better. Beatty is also OK - but it's his debut film and he has the courage to take on such a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start to collapse. And Reynolds is simply amazing - one of his best acting jobs EVER! As this has not even been nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Even Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are too credible as the hillbillies. <br /> <br /> A powerful film - NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version - the TV version is butchered. Even the letterbox display is essential for capturing stunning images.
