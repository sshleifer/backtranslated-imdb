In Manhattan, the American bourgeoisie Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a rented apartment with four bedrooms and a bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency that collects $ 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees an advertisement for a huge house for sale in Connecticut at an affordable price, he drives with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends an acquaintance to inspect the house, and the man says he should put down the house and build another one. Jim checks the information with other engineers and everyone condemns the place and first finds out that he bought a "money pit" instead of a dream home. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his house" is an extremely entertaining comedy, with jokes and a first-rate script. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man driven by the impulse to realize with the American dream of owning a huge house he finds that he made a bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feels jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked on a very funny film visibly inspired by this delightful classic, "The Money Pit". My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Torment" ("Home, My Torment")
