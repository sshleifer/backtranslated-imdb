"Casomai" is a masterly story that describes the story of a young couple who earns the murky waters of marriage. The story is very credible in telling the strange noise between the oblivion and the continuing interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (one might wonder if similar events are different elsewhere, though). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and this is one of the strengths of the film. The acting of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and compelling. And the figure of the nice priest is fun and all-round. All in all, a truly deserving film, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
