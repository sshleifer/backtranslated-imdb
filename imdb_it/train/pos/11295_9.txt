This film has always been one of my favorites since I saw it as a 12-year-old boy in 1962 when it was shown in a "final show" of a Los Angeles television station. The characters are very eye-catching from the beginning of the image, and it's a shame that the film was never released for video, nor is it ever shown on television (apparently due to a ban by the Moss Hart estate, the playwright / producer / director who wrote the story and presented it for the first time on the New York stage during World War II - the reason why denying his performance is hard to understand more than 50 years after his realization). I haven't seen the movie for over 30 years, when someone who was an important cast member managed to get me a "bootlegged" copy on VHS (poor video quality, but good audio). My memory was correct: it was still a captivating and fascinating film to watch. A surprising aspect of this film is the way in which many of its stars, starting in their careers in 1944, have become both major movie stars or at least well-known and fully employed actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O ' Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the Liberators of the B-24 are terrifying, especially the close-ups in which you can see the details of the gigantic (for that time) 4-engine bomber (thus more than 18,000 buildings, now almost extinct). Good vision of the different levels of training that a cadet pilot went through while being assigned to a bomber crew (obviously VERY kind, as was the trend of the day: only UOMs became pilots, women only supported them in their roles - hardly acceptable in today's world). I hope one day it will be released on video for a new generation.
