Gathering immediately after Moscow's showdown on Supremacy, this is Bourne's greatest adventure and its final climax. During 115 minutes, the film brings Bourne from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Morocco and finally New York. Damon is in every inch of the hard-trained killer Robert Ludlum imagined, he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now, and it's the submission of emotions to his character that makes him so believable, and that's exactly the way Damon manages to combining these two poly-opposites of itself are so breathtaking. In this third, Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and as he watches it, Ultimatum offers such extraordinary performances that you find yourself sweating and gasping on his powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; just look at two big car chases and a fight scene as realistic as Bond against Shaw in '63. Director Greengrass has outdone himself with this thrilling thriller and this is probably as exciting as thriller movies; a real prize for Bourne fans and a new generation of espionage standards.
