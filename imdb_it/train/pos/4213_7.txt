Director Samuel Fuller creates a brilliant visual set-up: cocky pickpocket unknowingly raises some microfilm from a woman's bag; it turns out that he is a courier for the communists, and now she and the artisan are guarded by the police. The film noir formula is all its glory - before the ingredients become clich√©s - including seafront clubs, floozies, soundtrack saxophones, and a hell of surprise fights. The performances of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are perfect, and the elegant and brilliant script is quite colorful. The fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the secondary role of "crazy professional". Exciting, atmospheric, hard as nails. *** from ****
