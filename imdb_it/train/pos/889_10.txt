This is one of the best Hong Kong action movies around and has a tense and exciting storyline, as well as great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and even a great hero. It is the only martial arts film that interested me in the plot rather than waiting for the fights. Sammo fans - This is a must see (see also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
