... It is not the first time that Stanley obscures the distinction between genres with such a great effect. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrible situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario that really produces very funny moments. The madness that burns slowly and the attempt to kill one's family is not exhilarating, of course, but the dialogue is very aware ("five months of peace is just what I want ...") and there is a terrifying drinking scene that would be ridiculous if you include only one kind of spirit, but it's chilling when you put pressure on the other. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The signals that Nicholson offers the public as an actor do nothing but hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment in which he finds himself, however, absorbs those defects of the personality and frees them on his conscience. In much the same way that buildings are thought to absorb events happening there, the hotel feeds on the weaknesses of a problematic but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant defects in his personality before he arrives, but for me the same Overlook is the trigger that drives them. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's cold and detached directorial approach works beautifully for a cold horror movie, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson continually staggers between making you chuckle and scare you to death. When it explodes, you won't be sure how far it can go. Together they made a great team and with a mixture of their talents they gave us a classic. If you want a fantastic visual experience, this is an example that really shines ...
