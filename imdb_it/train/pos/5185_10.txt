I've seen this movie well over 100-200 times and I love it every time I look at it. Yes, it can be very trivial but it is also very fun and enjoyable. The field shown in the film is a real field that I actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as the camp is really, an ideal place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever gone to the camp, wanted to go to the camp, or sent a child to the camp, should see this movie because it will bring wonderful memories for you and your children.
