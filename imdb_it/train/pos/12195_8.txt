Each film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph until The Third Man with Joseph Cotton. It's also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil. Please watch them all! It tends to become pompous and selfish in films like F is for Fake, really stupid waste of movies. Don't waste time looking at it. he is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone studying film should see everything he filmed. All her protagonists are huge but in the end Welles has become a drunken drunk, like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on, but I digress ... and because I am a woman, I can see the attraction for him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last real directors and, unless the directors of today are counted: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the directors are not up to the directors of the '40s! I know there are many other great filmmakers of today but in such a short time I can't name them all. No offense for any of the great directors of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please, remind me of some emerging directors, I don't want to get stuck in the past! I love some of the upcoming films, but rarely there is one that I would like to include in a list of the "100 best". "Hustle and Flow" was great, as was "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you , "from a line in Sullivan's travels; another good movie from the forties! Can anyone give me a better list for the 90s and up to 2006? I'd like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also props for this site! Where else can you connect a movie or whistle it! I love the resentment and delirium of normal people like me who can say what I want and I promise not to ruin any film for someone who hasn't seen it yet!
