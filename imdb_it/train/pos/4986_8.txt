Lensman is an anime jewel less known from the studios of Toho and MK. It's freely based on the novel, but it reminds me a lot of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see in Japanese with subtitles or simply Japanese. The dubbed English version was almost cropped and changed to death. <br /> <br /> There isn't much new, although it's the first animated feature to combine CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch, however.
