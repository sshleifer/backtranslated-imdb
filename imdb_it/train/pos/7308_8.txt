With a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter gives life to a bitter nightmare on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis making her career-defining debut) and her spiteful friends plan a night of devious amusement, only to cross with a relentless psychopath of hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from a neighbor asly crazy ... after slaughtering his sister fifteen years earlier, he has now returned to Haddonfield, the sleepy Illinois town where his murder took place. Once he set his sights on Laurie after leaving a parcel in the abandoned house where he lived, he starts to haunt her and terrorize her, turning his night of fun into terror while teasing everyone on his way to her. br /> <br /> The beautiful cinematography and the lighting really make this horror film with a disturbing mood ... with the long dark shots you constantly feel as if you were haunted by the maniac serial killer himself. Myers is well hidden until it is fully revealed to the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is definitely obsolete, it is no less chilling. The idea is just to induce the donkey, and this little shock is one of the most famous and memorable horror films ever made to date ... it has generated seven sequels and in the end the equally scary remake of Rob Zombie, and has established a new standard for horror that still exists today.
