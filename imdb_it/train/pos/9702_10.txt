the city of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters would simply be wrong and too disturbing, but the fantastically brilliant writing means it works, and it works very well. Most people will know others with a touch of some characters, but hopefully no one knows people with extreme personalities like Tubbs and Edward, strangers who own the local store or the obsessive Pauline pen who treats the "dole scum" with very contempt. They were just some of the strange inhabitants. The TV series includes 3 series and a Christmas special. There are references to many horror films, like the wicker man. A more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the apocalypse of the gentlemen series, of which I will not say much but which I highly recommend. All in all the series of gentlemen is an exhilarating comedy with brilliant screenplays and brilliant characters. I would definitely say it's worth watching because you won't regret it!
