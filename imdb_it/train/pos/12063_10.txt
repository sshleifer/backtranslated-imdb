The Woman in Black (1989) is a television adaptation of Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, published only a few years earlier than the film. Unfortunately, this film was not released on DVD and, as far as I know, was deleted on VHS. His availability is in direct contrast to his popularity among those who are familiar with horror movies. The story revolves around the events in a seaside community at the beginning of the 20th century, when a young lawyer was sent by his company to close the business of a recently deceased widow, who died in his isolated marshy land. What he thought would be a routine task and probably boring turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was obsessed with his death, and that the ghosts of his past are not satisfied with resting. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, never being self-indulgent, flashy or overly explanatory. The obviously limited budget may have contributed to the absurd approach, but it is precisely what history needs and why it works so well. It's what you don't see that scares you. That being said, there is a particularly terrifying scene that is based on the visual, and works perfectly. I watched this movie during the day and it still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you love to be terrified, do what you need to grab and watch a copy of The Woman In Black.
