Remarkable because of his famous explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes his young lover's penis from his pants and mouth. Even without this moment the film is a splendid race, even if slightly disturbing, passionate and captivating. Detmers stages a great exhibition like the unbalanced, insatiable joy that runs through her bare plate. Dressed, partly dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me the last two are lost a bit and the ending is more confused when her boyfriend is released while other terrorists are released, she seems uncertain about who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in her exams than anything else while crying , beautifully, of course!
