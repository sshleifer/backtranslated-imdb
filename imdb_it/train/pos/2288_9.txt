It is so rare to find a literary work translated adequately on the screen that could have evaluated this film higher than it deserves, but not by much. As a longtime scholar of Vonnegut's works, I do not hesitate to recommend the film to his readers, at least to those who love it like me. The casting is inspired: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, disoriented in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is succulent, but her manipulation of the wicked Resi and her tragic growing up almost make you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin offers a totally amiable but equally treacherous Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> You don't feel you have to read Mother Night to enjoy the movie; however, if you haven't read Mother Night, you will probably want to see it after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the steps from color to black and white and vice versa, and don't miss the final symbolism of Campbell's noose. Also watch the cameo by Kurt Vonnegut towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never seem the same (I write in mid-December, when the song is playing a heavy radio and it's driving me crazy).
