Frankly, I don't understand why this film was such a big "flop" in advertising. Sharon Stone has certainly not lost his charisma and his "touch" from "Basic instinct". I voted for this film 10 and I tell you why: the game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell moved from the events in BI1. Once again he proves to be a brilliant manipulator of his own class. He's "rubbing your brain" like Catherine with such an ability that in the end you're not quite sure who the real villain is. <br /> <br /> As for the technical part of the film: Only a real setback is the crew of B-rate actors. Sharon Stone is the only big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc. In the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone had been a little younger, but she is still quite stunning in her appearance and has only improved her charisma. His "assistants" B-rate are not so bad, even though I wanted some bigger names for the cast. <br /> <br /> I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a thriller far better than many of the shit Hollywood distributes so readily these days. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, not Russians in the middle of the film and the most important thing - the moor is on.
