Is this your typical love story in shipping chains? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works now, the beautiful woman is introduced in a photo, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this film follows some typical narrative lines, but this says nothing about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, although brief. Some things made no sense, like the need to enter random fights, but it's fun to watch, the fights were really well done. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a comedy before, but it has a lot of good feeling to it. Humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach, but you'll keep smiling. <br /> <br /> There is some smoky action, so not for children.
