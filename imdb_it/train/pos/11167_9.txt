One of my favorites, this film tells of two lurking New York characters, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), who aspire to be the "Main Guy" in the Bowery at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although this is a heavily fictionalized tale of their antics (based on a play). The legendary Brodie (did he?? - is still a cause for discussion!), Jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here as happens at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898 ). Director Walsh has clearly had a great affection for the period, so magnificently recreated here, and includes a die-hard ragtime number from living room singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). Raft is at his best at Brodie, and Beery shows again that smart actor was, like hard, big heart, and sometimes very moving Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest that kids are pursuing. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy "The Bowery" moves at a fast pace (unlike many of the early "talkies"). It is not an easy film to find, but it is worth looking for.
