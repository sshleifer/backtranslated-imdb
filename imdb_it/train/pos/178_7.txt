"Protocol" is a successful photo with Goldie Hawn as a sparkling cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of an Arab visiting from a murder attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the US government. Will the corridors of power in our nation's capital always be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual although "Protocol" is not as fun as his best film "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
