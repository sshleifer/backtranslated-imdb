Possible spoilers: late cameos appearance <br /> <br /> Seldom shows so many actors of refined and memorable characters (almost entirely actresses to be precise) in a film. Although some appear only for cameos, each is a gem. The British do this mix of comedy and real life pathos better than anyone else, so it's not surprising that most of the actors are English. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic; no doubt a lot has been nicknamed (really Leslie Caron * plays bass so well? Maybe - who knew?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers. > <br /> Being an elderly musician myself, not really old and certainly not in that class, obviously it was also an encouraging film - a fantastic film for all those who wonder if they have passed it in their profession or anything they can to be. And obviously a great celebration of stage life. <br /> <br /> I lost some of the opening, but a provisional 9/10 - and it certainly makes us want to see it all.
