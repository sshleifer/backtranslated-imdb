Richard Linklater's mix of youthful romance and Parisian pastime is one of the best thought's romantic films of the 90s. Julie Delpy turns into one of the most engaging performances of the decade as the Parisian girl who spends a day with a stranger on the Ethan Hawke train. The dialogue (and there are many) is sometimes sinuous and excessively precious, but this portrait of two young lovers of falling in love who create a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection with one another is full of wonderfully funny moments, moving and penetrating.
