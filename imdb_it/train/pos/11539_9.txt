THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous comedy about a television newswriter named Felix Unger, who is an obsessive maniac, moving with his best divorced friend, Oscar Madison, a sportswriter and complete slob, after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets it from the moment he does it. Neil Simon's classic comedy first appeared on Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau as an Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes the place of Carney in the film version with a memorable performance like Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role, but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Fortunately, Matthau was allowed to recreate his Oscar role, a unique gem of a comic performance that provides consistent laughter everywhere. This team of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be the gold of comics that was re-visited in nine other films. With both of these actors no longer with us, the vision of this classic becomes more touching but no less fun. Simon's drama has been well extended to the screen with a silent prologue describing a depressed Felix's suicide attempt which is a winner. The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar's poker friends and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon sisters, giving Oscar and Felix the dark. Of course, later it became a great TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there's nothing like the original. A joy from beginning to end.
