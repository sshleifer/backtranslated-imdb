I was literally getting ready to hate this movie, so believe me when I say this movie deserves to be seen. Overall, the story and the gags are invented, but the film has the charm and finesse to take them out. That gag in which Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss / future father and colleagues see him scratching is not terribly smart, but he sent me into a frenzy of laughter. Very few gags in the film are of a high standard, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has a lot of charm and charm. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are nice. I must say that I would like to see the character of James Brolin more, since it was a real blast in the few scenes he was in. Also, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage not to make the wife's character (which acts as an obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The character of Selma Blair is hardly unlikely, and there is never a scene where I thought to myself, "Why did he want to marry her in the first place?" The ending is Hollywood, but it could have been much more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I have not had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's main work. I loved it so much in the films of Kevin Smith that I couldn't help but feel disappointed to see him in these imaginative roles. And he never seems comfortable in these imaginative roles. Even in this film, he does not seem perfectly at ease, but contributes with his two cents and effectively manages every scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles demonstrates again because she is so damn nice. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to pass out, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, its beauty shows inside and out. I don't know the name of the actresses, but the woman who plays the drunk grandmother is hilarious. Even Julie Hagerty has a small part, and it's always nice to look at, which makes me want to get better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that it's a shame she doesn't have the same opportunities to show off her skills. <br /> <br /> Do not be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. This is a fun and fascinating film. Romantic comedies are becoming so predictable nowadays that it seems that the genre is ready to be thrown into the toilet, so it's always nice to see it among all these bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
