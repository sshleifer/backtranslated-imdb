Pecker is a hilarious but entertaining film about a small city in Baltimore, whose daily routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who photographs "real things". No models, no beautiful men, just a hard life. This wonderful film makes fun of the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is one scene in particular when a homeless woman who buys at Pecker's mother thrift shop buys the same coat as one of the Whitney Art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This shows that regardless of the type of money you have, you may not always have the taste. Once again John Waters sends you into an endless spiral of laughter and pure reality. You can have your traditional Hollywood movies with special influences and mountains of celebrities, but give me a "Pecker" or a "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) on a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" every day !!
