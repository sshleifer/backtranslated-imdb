And this someone is me. And not just me, as I can see here on IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why did people love him? It's obvious: by now everyone knows zombies (at least Horror fans by heart and the others through the reinvention films "Dawn of the Dead" or Resident Evil etc.) <br /> <br /> Or at least they thought they knew everything on the zombies ... until this film arrived. And you will see the zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, even if it contains violent scenes, but it is rather a comedy. A satire to be precise. And it never runs out! This is why I rated it so high. The rhythm is incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) errors ... on the contrary: it is a gem and if you are just a little interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you don't like them, watch it! Because it's a great movie (comedy)!
