In your video store, you might find this gem. <br /> <br /> The human condition in modern times LA. No exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that could happen to any group of people over time. <br /> <br /> Helps you understand the joys and despair of urban life. <br /> <br /> The management and cutting is first class. Cinematography and music very much follow the mood and the situation. And the CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent cast and excellent acting. No one out of place or out of character. <br /> <br /> And it is NOT as much a downer as you'd expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, do it!
