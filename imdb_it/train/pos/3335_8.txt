The film shocked me. Personally, I mostly had a bad buzz. Well, finally, after having owned the DVD for months, I got it into a sleepless night. even if the film dragged the extra movie it was used for the purpose of the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from the addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scene. The best thing about the film is its consistency with the relationship. There were neither the ex nor the characters who threatened the relationship. I mean typically we see the girl who meets the boy from a surprising twist of fate, dating, something we have seen coming breaks them and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this film did not follow that form. In reality we have experienced the relationship and its defects and even if the characters have had moments of anti-love, they have not had dramatic pauses if they have left and have done a montage every 15 and then they have reunited again in love. I didn't think the movie was as predictable as the rest of romantic movies. The story was unique and truthful in reality in the way I felt that these people in the film were the most credible I've ever seen in a modern-day love film. And it didn't hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were in the real world series so fate got kicked in a while there too. It is not "My fair lady" but it is a lively and honest film. I will simply say that I like it.
