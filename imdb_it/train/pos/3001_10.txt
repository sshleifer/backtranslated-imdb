Cracking of good yarn with all the actors that give great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. A lot of nice twists and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his best. A forerunner in the Thin Man series. Recommend to everyone. Do you understand everything?
