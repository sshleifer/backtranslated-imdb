It is very rare that a film appeals to spectators of all ages - to children for a beautiful narrative and a wonderful and colorful production, and, to adults, for a literal script, excellent production values, good fusion / acting, all tied up along with a good Rozsa score. Two approximately contemporary films do this - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some of the background on this production is fascinating. This production, started in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and turned out to be a cover for British intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, was later knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of intersection between art, commerce and politics! By all means, make sure you get a good CD of this movie for your library!
