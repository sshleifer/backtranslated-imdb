I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and particularly beautiful film. The plot is simple but effective, the characters are adorable and well finished, but what really shines is the digital set. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than reality, the drawings really give you a great look at the world in a stunning use of color. Sometimes the touches of reality shine (especially the water was impressive), but nevertheless, it is a fantasy world based on reality. Including a lot of vast landscapes, in particular, helps to minimize rendering costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this shines with an effective use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> No more technical talk, the film is fun, family-friendly and sometimes just fun.
