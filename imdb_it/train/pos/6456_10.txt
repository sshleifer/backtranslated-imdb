My expectations were pretty high for this movie. Everyone I know who has seen this movie in the cinema told me that everyone present remained in the credits because they were so moved. My expectations could not be higher, anything to say the least wonderful would have disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I was far from disappointed with this movie. I loved the way he treated difficult subjects without going through the usual steps that a Hollywood film tends to include. In this film the characters worked for problems they had had for decades, worked through prejudice, learned to open up. But it wasn't easy, and not just singing a song or two. It was painful, it took arguments, it took clashes. It felt like real life. <br /> <br /> A scene that I really liked was the scene where Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is adorable and one could say that she wasn't just synchronizing her lips with a previous recording during filming (which I often find in other films), she really sang with her whole body and soul. You could hear how Gabriella felt in that scene. If this movie had been made in Hollywood, his song would probably have been sung towards the end, and he would have opened his eyes and seen the error of his ways, as well as making other people in the village realize a thing or two. Instead it came in half and brought no solutions. Her husband didn't feel overwhelmed and he realized what he was doing, and he didn't seem to make it more open to anyone else in the village. He was handsome, he was pure and touching, but he did not magically solve all his problems. It felt real, probably what would have happened in real life. The whole film seemed like real life, nothing wrapped in an orderly way but all with a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie that looks so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were some things that bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you don't already have it, you should go and see "As it is in heaven" and be full of joy for life, a sense of hope and the feeling that you have been touched on a film level rarely reach. You will be sad, sorrowful, happy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir, there would be no more wars. Having seen this movie, I may have to agree.
