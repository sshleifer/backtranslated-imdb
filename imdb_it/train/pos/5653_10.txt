This was an absolutely fascinating series and I regretted being able to see some shows only when it was aired late at night in the UK. His style was so different from others of his kind and the whole thing had a disturbing air of elegant terror. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative I can see) to understand what a really innovative series it was and how it was captured by the imagination. Now I understand from reading the comments that he received CANCELED which is simply amazing. What kind of "scrambled headless turkeys suitable" there must have been (or maybe just maybe they still are) around doing it.
