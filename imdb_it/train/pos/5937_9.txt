After seeing the "Batman Dead End" short, I didn't know what to expect from World's Finest. Naturally, Superman and Batman. All my best comics in the world have them as teammates. <br /> <br /> After watching this 3 and a half minute trailer, it made me want someone to make a film for the World's Finest fan serializer, if it weren't a real feature film. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Superman's things were poor, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, giving you just a few aspects of the entire product. He seems to need a complete product. <br /> <br /> In addition to the relative of director Sandy Collera who plays a very sad Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie had been made, the actors would have been chosen to fit the film, although I think Nina Kaczorowski would be a good Lois Lane, especially if she had a close dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Clark Bartram wearing the Batman Dead End costume, but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s Batman with a 80s leather cape and hood -'90. His behavior is similar to that of Batman, but I still wonder what the validity of white contact lenses is instead of allowing only his eyes to show through the mask. I think the goal was to bring him closer to the comic book character rather than the movie character. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn cannot play Superman, period. He stands up with a silly expression on his face that simply says "slap me". And online delivery seems to be a problem with him. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, I'd like to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious work. Word has spread that a World's Finest movie has been made and with the right additions to the script, it could be this. I hope more than that are done.
