David Lynch's (1999) film from the John Roach / Mary Sweeney story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time before the film's final release. <br /> <br /> We come late to the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) in life. His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> This makes what you decide to do even more remarkable and appealing. He decides (and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put some things in order. <br /> <br /> Alvin is, at this time of his life, a man of great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with an impediment of language that makes communication a great effort for the public. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can't help but come out as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> This film is the story of a journey. But like all travel, it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin should reasonably undertake. <br /> <br /> But along the way, we learn slowly as Alvin has so many qualifications that equip him to achieve his unlikely goal. His goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is sick and will probably die and wants to visit him. He had a fight with him many years ago and they haven't talked for a long time. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin meets many people. The way it behaves towards them and the benefit of having it known is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are ... better.
