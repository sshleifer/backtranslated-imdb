This was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think in a $ 2 cinema along Hollywood Blvd., so I had no reference to Joe Don Baker's first episode. I remember being shocked by the corrupt McNairy County system and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". I was also amazed that a man decided he wouldn't let it slip and went out to do something about it. Courageous? I thought so - to a point where it made me shiver down my spine. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a great story about the American courage to stand up and do something for a system that serves only its own interest. I was pretty upset, and I think this is still one of the best films of the hero / antihero genre, which could be laughed at but includes recent films like "The Punisher", but even more because it's true story. The recent remake starring the "Rock" does not do justice to the real fire in the history of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> A "classic" that I am sure will return in the future in the future.
