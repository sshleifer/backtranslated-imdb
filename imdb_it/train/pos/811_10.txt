When I think of Return of the Jedi I think epic. Yes, the Ewoks were there and then? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention the fact that they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to bring down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is decidedly more obscure than the rest of the films. Emperor Palpatine (played by the magnificent stage actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so mean and evil, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. About Darth Vader, what an incredible end for such an iconic character. Vader is really a modern Greek tragedy and I think that now people can understand and appreciate it especially after Revenge of the Sith is released. His redemption in the end was moving and really brings a happy but bittersweet feeling. The best part was obviously the special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with its graphics. The scenes at Jabba's palace (Leia looks incredible in that metal bikini) and, of course, the epic three-way battle at the end is still amazing to watch. In all of Jedi's deep storyline and emotional moments (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and incredible special effects are the perfect conclusion to one of the most beloved franchises in the history of cinema.
