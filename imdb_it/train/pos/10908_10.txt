I could not hold back my tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It was shocking, disturbing and stimulating all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone looking for something that makes them think about what they are doing with their lives. Or simply, something that will make you think. Look how John lives in the last two months of his life. Watch as he spends his days with a positive attitude. At some point you start to see that he really is an extraordinary individual. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and his struggles will make you cry, laugh and discover that life is much easier to live if you take it only one day at a time.
