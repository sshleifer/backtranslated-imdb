Samuel Fuller is an interesting director, mainly because he had a very inconsistent policy in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisies and madness of America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" painted the war as a necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street" "talks about the dangers of communist spies. All of his films make the vision very funny, and although he has often been classified as a b-director, Fuller has lived up to any of the major studio contractors "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the old themes, the cinematic style is definitely ahead of its time. It is also a very fast, tight and occasionally brutal film noir. <br /> <br /> The acting across the board is fantastic Richard Widmark is a great antihero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for his communist spy boyfriend.The show stealer is Thlema Ritter, however, in an absolutely delightful performance like a police stoolies. The angles that Fuller employs are grandiose, making the acting sequences even more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for his time). The camera moves continuously just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great noir action thriller. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
