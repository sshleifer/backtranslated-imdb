I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit I liked this movie. It was dark and a little creepy with some slightly edgy scenes, I don't know if classifying this film is a bit SF and a bit horror thrash. I saw this at about 2:00 or so on my local channel there was nothing else, so I decided to watch it. If you haven't seen this movie the id I recommend it, it's not so bad, the characters are quite interesting but I haven't really explored their full potential that could have made this movie even more beautiful. I don't know if this movie went to the cinema but it seemed it was made for TV or had gone directly to the video, I would have bought it first if it is on DVD, it fits my type of film well and contains a small fragment of X-FILES. Government businesses or elusive companies involved in shady dark affairs. Overall, a good movie.
