Samuel Fuller's film on South Street is anomalous: a "Red Scare" film without hysteria, in which the communist threat is none other than the McGuffin that lights up the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves the loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to both, it hides vital secrets for the Cold War. Peters, of course, was under surveillance by FBI agents who don't let themselves be intimidated by theft like the man who is handling her, cowardly, like Richard Kiley. In an attempt to recover the precious film, both sides use the help of Thelma Ritter, an old jane streetwise who is always on the air and willing to sell what she feels. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws from a rich palette of rhythms and tones in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of the escalation of brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, its mid-summer in Manhattan takes on a sweaty shine that is almost pungent. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture between the tumultuous and the tender, and are marked with "Again", a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, starring also Widmark. The rhythm fades for the scene of Ritter's death, beautifully written and interpreted, among the most moving scenes of all noir and a sort of mirage oasis in a film dried up by sentimentality. This is Fuller's writer / director who works only in the narrower confines of the noir cycle; his subsequent explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A.) have never resulted in a satisfactory synthesis like Pickup on South Street.
