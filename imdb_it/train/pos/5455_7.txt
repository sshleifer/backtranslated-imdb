Infamous pre-code film, actually the only film that pushed people to insist that the Hayes Code was strictly applied. Barbara Stanwyck plays a young girl whose father who sells liquor has no problem advertising it to customers. When he dies in an accident, he is released into the world with the knowledge that his single body can get what he wants. He goes to New York and proceeds to climb the company ladder, one bed at a time. Although obviously not true sex is shown, the film is rather bleak. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades (when Stanwyck discovers a railroad car inspector so that he can travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck herself is the only thing worth considering. As always, it's fantastic.
