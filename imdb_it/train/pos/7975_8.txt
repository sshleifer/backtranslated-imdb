I love Malle's documentaries. They are so simple and effortless but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even for racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you can't help but fall in love with them too. <br /> <br /> Malle shot most of it in 1979. He returned 6 years later to see what had changed. This would have been a good film without the material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It may seem that Malle was doing what was done in the Up series, but in reality it is not. The Up series is about people. Malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person, but on what happened to this community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan era and farmers are suffering. Once a proud community, now no one sees much of the future and parents hope their children can educate themselves and do something other than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite relevant today. Our financial crises started today because of what was happening then. Just take a look at these last words of the film, spoken by an old lawyer of the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have high hopes for this country because things are going well now I can only characterize me in my mind as an obsession for greed and a nation does not live long with that obsession, and in particular a democracy that ... There is some good - there is good - much of the good in this country and a lot of good people and they won't - they won't stick to this philosophy of greed that's happening now. It's horrible. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately it took over 20 years and a hell of a headache head before that happens.
