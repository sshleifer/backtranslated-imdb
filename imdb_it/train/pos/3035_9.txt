MacArthur is a great film with a great story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of the great American military figures and a figure that has been familiar to me since the first moments of my memory. Although there is a problem of continuity (there could be others) eg. MacArthur's speech described in the film as his 1962 speech at the US Military Academy on the acceptance of the Thayer award did not contain the phrase "the old soldiers never die, they simply vanish." (It was in his speech to Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two disagreed!) Gregory Peck is as clever as the general who swore returned to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the General, his family and his staff from the beginning of World War II until the end of his service career. This film would be much more important for those familiar with the Second World War and the Korean War. However, Peck's portrait of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as one can of soldier is truly memorable. "Victory cannot be substituted in war."
