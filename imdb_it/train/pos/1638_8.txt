Heartland was in production around the same time as Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland cost a fraction but is 10 times the movie. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate was "the largest and most expensive ($ 40 mil in 1980!) Hollywood flops of all time, its failure led to the sale of United Artists to MGM" - imdb entry <br /> <br /> Heartland costs a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing, directing, photography and acting. It easily attracts you in the beauty, in the joys, in the privations and in the sadness of pioneer life. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Hollywood sometimes pours millions of turkeys (based on the great success of a director) and neglects such a wonderful story.
