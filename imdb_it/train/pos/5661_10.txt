I see many people on this site who want AG to come on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, no less!) While it's nice to have this amazing show on a boxed DVD, I'm shocked that they added very few in terms of "extras" (A comment from Shaun Cassidy's director on the pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order in which they were aired on TV. Missing episodes that have never been shown before being performed on the Sci Fi channel are in the box, but are pasted on the final DVD. If you buy the DVD set, you get the order in which they should be displayed and you will be happier. (You will have to swap the DVDs in and out of your player to see them in order, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
