This was different, that's for sure. Watch the cast! Talk about oddball. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the protagonists, although a group of actors almost share the spotlight, in this farce on the superhero-wannabees. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of the fame of "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, bright colors and no drops. It's a pretty funny, light comedy, with nothing but stupid characters, who all want to be Superman heroes, Batman, Spiderman, your name. They have talents in strange areas, however, that true heroes don't (and don't want to!). It's silly, but you know it's happening. <br /> <br /> It is also a movie that you can watch in installments and not really lose any continuity. It's a long movie for someone so hectic, so taking a break here and there is fine. The language was docile, so even children could have fun. In fact, I don't remember swearing here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept saying "What a stupid fucking movie". I thought it was fun two hours but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
