I can agree with other comments that there was not a huge amount of history discussed in the film, but it was not a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think he did a great job. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. Like all of a sudden it would have been thrown but I understood the history and the bond between the families later and I found it rather good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a re-enactment of the 1960s it brought to light very important and important reference periods of the decade. I found it very funny and worth seeing.
