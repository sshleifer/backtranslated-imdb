You probably all know it by now, but on ABC.com you can see 5 additional episodes never published. I've watched a lot of television over the years and this is maybe my favorite show, always. It is a crime that this beautifully written and recited show has been canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and omg, Steven Caseman - are all incredible and so natural in those roles. Even the children are fantastic. Wonderful show. So sad that it's gone. Of course I wonder why it was canceled. There is no way for me to believe that Ms. Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. He was in the perfect time slot in this market. I saw all the episodes on ABC.com again - I hope they will all come out on DVD one day. Thanks for reading.
