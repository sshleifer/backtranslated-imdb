I saw this movie after seeing Capote and Infamous. It's amazing how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the film. The journalist is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly, but by reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from the similarities that writer / director Brooks creates. <br /> <br /> Notice the incredible cut at the beginning where the killers and killers are connected. The cutter on the phone is paired with Perry on the phone. Face-washing cutter is paired, cut to Perry who washes his face. Only Perry looks in the mirror and sees his erotic male body that triggers the fantasy of playing a guitar in Las Vegas on empty chairs. This failure / fantasy coincides with the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us of his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that pheasants wear So they are going to die. we cut for the Clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream of a yellow bird, "taller than Jesus" that attacks the nuns who persecuted them. "The nuns begged for mercy," he says, "but the bird slaughtered them anyway." The bird raised Perry to heaven. Strangely, Perry says he has an aversion to the nuns, God and religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but doesn't know to whom. <br /> <br /> The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter receives an offer to sleep in a friend's house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on one of his photos and the house later. Nancy can't sleep at her friends' home because her boyfriend is having dinner. The decision seals his destiny. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre". But it is another image of Bogart, "Beat the Devil" that Truman Capote co-wrote, in which an imaginary treasure hunt is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing. Dick wants the real money, the $ 10,000 he thinks they are in Clutter's safe, (which ironically turns out to be a fantasy like Perry's Mexican treasure. <br /> <br /> Cut to Herb Clutter signs life insurance of $ 40,000 Politics: he is thinking about mortality at this time, ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours: the insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, still ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours. /> <br /> Dick said they didn't want witnesses so nobody would remember them, but later all the witnesses who were remembered were eliminated. <br /> <br /> "There was a witness," continues the detective to tell Dick later, but was a witness of the prison friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God? The viewer becomes the witness after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating film.
