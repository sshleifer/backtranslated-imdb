I saw him last night after not having seen him for several years. It's really a little funny movie, with a lot of faces you didn't know were there. Arkin glows as always. Check it out; you will not be disappointed. By the way, it has just been released on DVD and, contrary to its packaging, is widescreen. The transfer is rather poor, but at least the WHOLE film is visible. ;-)
