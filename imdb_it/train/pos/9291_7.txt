An interesting look at Japan before it opens in the West. John Wayne, the first American consul in Japan, arrives according to the agreements deriving from the diplomacy of Perry's gunboats. It is not welcome Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bringing a cholera epidemic under control, introduced by an American ship. A colorful procession to the capital follows with presents for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The encounter with the Shogun, the debates between the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibition present an interesting look at the politics of the period. Altogether a rather amusing film and, moreover, how often you can see the Duke losing a fight for a boy half his size.
