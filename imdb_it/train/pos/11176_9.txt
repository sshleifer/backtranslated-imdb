Ok, first I must stress the fact that when I first saw this film I was 9 years old. If I had seen this two weeks ago for the first time, I probably would have noticed that this is just another horror movie with cable TV and some well-made scenes. But when you're nine, you don't care about those facts. This scared the hell out of me, especially those Zelda scenes (and they still do). Nowadays I'm a little fond of this movie. I have to see him maybe once a month, and every New Year's Eve I watch him with a 12-pack of beer and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a nice party! I agree with those people who said that acting here is rather unintentional. Midkiff and Crosby seem to resemble Louis and Rachel, but you don't see much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne practically save the scenes that "i Credo" are underlying. What I really want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that bears any resemblance to Pet Sematary, and I don't mean the story of the zombies here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that on a superficial level looks like a cable TV, but leaves you with a cold compared to the best horror-chillers out there? Okay, I broke some cast balls a minute ago, but I have to say that all the pieces of that level have also perfected the overall acting to perfection. But hey tell me if you really know any movies like Pet Sematary! I would really like to know ... And I don't mean the night of the living dead here ... this is far beyond the comparison of intelligence to that stuff.
