PAGE 3 **** on 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters her boyfriend's house and is empty. Look here and there and then go into his bedroom and get the photo - "Ah! Another girl ?? that two-step jerk and yes indeed he time her two but it's a GUY this time. And I say" Brilliant! "<br /> <br /> END OF SPOILERS (The scene above is not really a spoiler ... but for me it was so I didn't want to risk it) <br /> <br /> When asked how it is It was this film, my friend replied "oh, it's just an exhibition of the P3 people" that made me believe that it would be bad looking at a stupid movie if nothing else. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself: " it is better that you take a pen and a sheet of paper to write down the bad things about this film, "but I proved to be completely wrong and then some because I could only collect the goods. This film was great. Fantastic, not because it is an unusual and non-commercial cinema as a plot, but because of the intelligence in the script and how this movie tells you how to manage a brilliantly film that could have been a stupid and meaningless film if delivered in the wrong hands. /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is so damn beautiful that she perfectly identified her role as if she was born to play this part. One of the most fascinating actresses I've ever seen. But this is not the only show that is good in the film, there are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. In particular Sandhya Mridul who turns on the screen. (And also guess who normally talks Tara Sharma in a normal way) <br /> <br /> The film is the protagonist of some stupid old celebrations of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you have the idea of ​​what it is this the film will be about. And for about half an hour through the film you hear almost the same thing. But then the film takes the pace on a good plot and never lets it go. Does Boman Irani also agree with this statement? "It was a good story, Madhvi." (Thank you). The nice thing is that it addresses the problem of how these people are stupid with style and they can't make it and it also tackles social problems and doesn't make them boring. In the end it's all a roller coaster ride and Madhvi informs us that just smiling at all these people. Just the reason I love watching movies. Ecstatic film. The script is beautiful, intelligent and witty.
