I loved my 3 year old. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. What about the level of violence? Not really the violent one, mostly of the slap stick variety. No one really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so it's certainly appropriate for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, beautifully made textures, with real depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. The moss on the stones, the rust on the metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone, all add to the whole. <br /> <br /> The modeling of the characters, unlike many contemporary CG movies, is bizarre, not pretty, again within an artistic whole. Faces may seem less malleable than other films, but the characters are more imaginative than human ones. I think it's a good thing, lend truthfulness, how strangely it may seem, it's easier to suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothes, at par, at least with the likes of Pixar. Just notice in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting against the giant bullet; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and everyone has detailed clothes that made me pause the movie just to admire it. <br /> <br /> The setting. Far beyond the likes of Cars, and even Wall ?? E. The space has been made many times, but the fantastic surroundings of Dragon Hunters are comparable only with some scenes of Never Ending Story and The Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole and with many good ideas launched effortlessly. Magnificent views like the scene in Monsters Inc. where they ride all the doors through its storage facility, or Wall ?? And where we see the immense trash towers he made, abound in this film, everything is great, but never paused on; it's just the background all the time! The interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic waterfalls. The Chinese wall, the islands that float in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? This is where I believe CG should go, create something that takes your breath away and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic, and fortunately without any voice and purely original for the film. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good. Lend inspiration to cartoons, especially a good use of stretch and squeeze. Sometimes it's not so realistic, but 3D models aren't even realistic. <br /> <br /> Even the characterization is well done. Lian-Chu, the gentle and uncertain giant, is gradually growing in confidence, arousing the attention of little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo the astute manager of Lian-Chu redeems himself at the end, while Zoé has not really changed at all, but who wants that cute baby to change anyway? I at least loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character from Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal fight in the group is smoothed out by external pressure, just as it should in an appropriate fantasy story. <br /> <br /> History is mostly reminiscent of the story of Never Ending, especially of how the world holds back. Monsters are a fairly standard fare, except for the flocked one. Missing the emotional impact of Wall ?? And, that is the real strong point of that film, but it is a much more fun ride, and it lacks the annoying music scene that reproduces in the previous one, and has action from the first scene. This film is what you want to see for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole film has, as I said, a whole vision, which seems to have been strictly followed in everything. <br /> <br /> It seems that the setting is ready for other adventures, and I hope so for the first one. <br /> <br /> A side note, the French actor who makes Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm glad it wasn't him, even though it's one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give him a maximum rating, a little surprised by the mediocre and low ratings of some; I tried to address some of the concerns expressed by two of the reviews with the lowest rating. Approach this film as an adventure and as a European film, not contrary to Hollywood, but different.
