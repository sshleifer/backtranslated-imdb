LOVE AT THE TOP - the entirely inexpressible American title for the superb French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which means, I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more surprising This film was much ahead of its time; even according to the highest standards of today, it creates things that seem rich and new. Shot by the underrated director Michel Deville, he challenges the description in the way he combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire in an entirely original mix - leaving for the end an important but subtle surprise to make it all go away suddenly sad and more understandable. The cast is splendid, ditto the writing and the theme. But it is the delightful tone of Deville, which keeps you constantly off balance, but exalts, which pushes this "lost" film to a very high level. (The interview written with the director on the "Special features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have the time.)
