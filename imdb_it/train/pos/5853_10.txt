I really liked this Summerslam because of the look of the arena, the curtains and only the general appearance was interesting for me for some reason. However, this may have been one of the best Summerslam of all time if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for the moment it was ok to have a huge fat man against a strong man but I'm glad the times have changed. It was a terrible main event, just like every game in which Luger finds himself is terrible. Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, this was the event Shawn called his big monster of a Diesel bodyguard, IRS vs 1-2 -3 Kid, Bret Hart takes Doink for the first time, hires Jerry Lawler and Harts and Lawler has always been very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker hired Giant Gonzalez in another terrible game, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this game was boring and has a terrible ending. However it deserves 8/10
