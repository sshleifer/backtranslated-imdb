A surprise thriller with more twists and doubles than a doodle pad. An exceptional cast that mixes everything with an intriguing plot overseen by Twin Peaks influence in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrait of a man in a blind alley looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP of a great actor) is always a villain, like Dennis Hopper. It's a pity he never made a high profile in the world of cinema. I'm sure he has his followers, though. Overall, this is a great movie that shows you don't need the big bang or a commercial soundtrack to be a fun movie.
