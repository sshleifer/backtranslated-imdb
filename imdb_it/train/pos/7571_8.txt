This game is placed above all so far. I had the honor of playing mine on PS2, so the graphics were really good. Voice acting was above the standard. The difficulty level is right. In my opinion, Wesker must be the best character in the RE series. The story amazed me and took many twists that I did not expect. The only assessment that this game deserves is great.
