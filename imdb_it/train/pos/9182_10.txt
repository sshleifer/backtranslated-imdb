Those who love the book Jane Eyre like I do (it's my favorite of all time, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a little too good to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he does a wonderful job playing the burning master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may have been a little too old to play Jane, 18, but when I watch this movie, I don't think about the ages of the characters. The dialogue of the film is taken almost literally from the book, which was very intelligent. Sure, this movie might seem a little long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I wish the people who made this film had been involved in the new Zeferelli version, as it would have helped that mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I saw this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! It's so versatile that I didn't recognize it. She plays Daisy in Keep the Apparitions, and she also played Mrs. Musgrove in 1995 Persuasion (another wonderful adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The DVD arrived this week and it's wonderful to see the original unmodified version. There is much more to the beginning (Young Jane to Gateshead and Lowood.) And in the end, they restored many things, (I always wondered why St. John had a piece of paper when he revealed he knew who Jane is - because the part where he tears it from his painting has been modified by the VHS version of the United States!). Rosamund Oliver is inside ... she was completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I know, they haven't modified any of Timothy Dalton's parts, so nothing new there, but it's nice to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... with maybe some interviews with the stars ... or a making of show)
