I just saw this episode tonight, in a recently added presentation from one of our independent local channels, which now features two episodes every day of the week. <br /> <br /> As the gentleman opined in the other, previous comment here, I agree that this may not have been one of the best programs in the series, but I find it still fun. <br /> <br /> My father was a friend of one of the principal (in my hometown, Cincinnati), for whom young Rod Serling had worked in the media there - and I remember that Pope told how much talent and creativity he had remembered there. Overall, "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the true classics of television, and given its production during the Cold War period, it offers not only a vision of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic picture of technical production , creative views and actors of this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Minor "spoiler". <br /> <br /> This particular story describes, like other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story in which the venue aims to provide a "surprise" ending. Sometimes the characters are on the earth, from elsewhere, while the story at first implies that at least one is a "terrestrial". These usually contained the message (as here) of a situation caused by doomsday buttons that had finally been pressed by the superpowers during this Cold War period. <br /> <br /> Seen today, stories like this offer a nostalgic aspect in this worldly point of view 4-5 decades ago, and I still provide some food for thought. - how did this episode. <br /> <br /> Although the dialogue has not extended the considerable talents of the leads, it still presents a simple and important message and 20 minutes of entertainment and interest.
