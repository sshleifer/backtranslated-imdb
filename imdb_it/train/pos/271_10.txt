It's all about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And wasn't it great ?! I love these Sunday afternoon popcorn movies for life. This is like one of those nail editors where they always go to the spot in the most annoying moments. Richard's character was completely disturbing. I went out with people like that. Well, not quite like that lol. I wish Zack hadn't been killed. It was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. I LOVE these Stalker type stories. He always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband usually doesn't like these types of movies, but I actually saw the whole thing with me and really enjoyed myself. I can't wait to see what Mitzi will do!
