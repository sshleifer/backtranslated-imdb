It is really rare that you can see the media deception up close that has been so widely reported as official "truth" and has captured so many "news" agencies with pants down. This film, in my opinion, deserves every price there is in journalism: it is objective (yes!), Courageous and a true "scoop". He can do without comments, fake scenes or important questions - everyone, including Chavez, can still make fun of their own words. The "solo" directors had to keep track of the events and keep the cameras rotating. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "How to depose a president and sell it as a victory for democracy". It is unbelievable that in the end they have lost, so far. From what I know, the largest television broadcaster involved has only revoked the land license, it is still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I strongly doubt that George W. or Barack Obama would be tolerant after a coup attempt. But then, they don't have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that the scam "Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians" has been repeatedly desired around the world reveals how biased the so-called "free" (established) media has become, or is always been, only more. An important lesson for anyone interested in what "really" happens in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous challenge "objectivity" always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the traditional view, or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse "us" - it was true with the effects of the atomic bomb, the secret story US to spread "democracy" around the world or the war in Iraq which, according to Johns Hopkins, killed 1.3 million Iraqis by now, not to mention the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the United States. And the United States is ready and willing to be more damaging to the Iranians than it was. <br /> <br /> I am rather curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Court in The Hague, whether we talk about "our" involvement in supporting and training the Pol Pot guerrilla in the 1980s , when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not. <br /> <br /> One more reason to turn to independent media for balancing, if not fraud exposure.
