A boy and a girl are chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by chance) the father of the warriors (or whoever he was). And they travel through the nature of the wildest parts of Africa. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is not so beautiful (except for that elephant boy). But it is a very good adventure and it is not very censored, there is a little blood, flesh and nudity (which lightens the film a little). <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 7 because of its image of the film The African nature and its action.
