Together with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my new favorite dramas of the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> Big cast all around, but I really liked Campbell Scott's work (the portrait of the return) and Hope Davis (the recent widow of the journalist killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, the script was fresh and the acting superb. The show was also shot in New York, the real city, not Warner Bros. or the backlot of some other studio, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I believe that people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other garbage realities. Too bad it didn't last.
