This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. In other places, I read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctiousious, politically correct priatellari. There is no one here, unless sexism is defined as a woman as a housewife and racist as a family employing a colored maid. <br /> <br /> The jokes are hilarious, and all contacts have never been better. Melvin Douglas is particularly brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you've ever thought about or tried to build a new home, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process is, no matter how much a wolves lamb might feel, you're not alone!
