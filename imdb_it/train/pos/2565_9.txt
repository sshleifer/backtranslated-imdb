I really liked this film about the relationships that sometimes developed between the American military and Japanese women in post-war Japan, as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them. Brando goes from having contempt for the Japanese (which is natural considering the Second World War) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is ok (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the film is wonderful all over the world. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his poignant show from another GI who fell in love with Japan (although Japanese women acting alongside him did an extraordinary job). <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin it but the film is nice to look at with a box of handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say SOMETHING and be fun at the same time. A mostly underestimated gem.
