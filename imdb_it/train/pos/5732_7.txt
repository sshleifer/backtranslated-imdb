Since September last year, I have been borrowing four to six films each week from the Harold Washington Library, which boasts an impressive DVD collection. (The HWL is really a library in circulation: three quarters of his films came out at a given time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find David Lynch's The Short Films. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I chose Dumbland. I'm here to report that, for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes is half an hour well spent. <br /> <br /> The most notable feature of these short pieces is their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. The scandalous voices highlight the ends of the pauses. Physical violence provides the beats. The chirping birds and the buzzing traps brush along the edges. Many other elements complete the orchestra. The rhythm of raw animation often synchronizes with sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch's main interest in creating and disseminating this work. In a sense, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> That said, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, stupid and fun to die. And there is enough space to reflect on how absurd we humans can be. I can't say I will look at the collection again, but for anyone who has enjoyed the movements that is the Inland Empire suite, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
