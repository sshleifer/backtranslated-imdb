"The Thing About My Folks" was a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta and based on a theatrical performance by one of its protagonists, Paul Reiser, proved to be a pleasant moment at the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what the result will be, this is a journey of discovery in which Ben knows his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the mythical figure which has in his mind. <br /> <br /> The film appears to be a vehicle for its star, Peter Falk, and escapes with the film, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most endearing actors working in films in this era and in past years, is an actor of this stature, he must be considered. Like Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not just by Ben, but appears from the whole family and the wife of forty-seven. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, the matriarch of the Kleinman clan, runs away, everyone panics because this woman, who was the strong figure of the family, is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she went, Sam shows up at the home of Ben confused as he suddenly feels abandoned by the woman he married and has been faithful to all those years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the younger son, takes his father on a journey to find a home he wants to buy, so he can take his family from Manhattan to the country. The journey provides an excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew because the old man had always projected a detached figure to the younger son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how much the old has been misunderstood by his children. Sam's love for Muriel spans the many years they met; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. Makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes that his life is about to change for the worst. Mr. Falk glows like the older man and there is never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling beneath him. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of Paul Reiser, we must confess him as Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his father discover how much they both have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is seen only at the end of the film. You make a good contribution as a fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style .. <br /> <br /> The film looks good thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham and the excellent soundtrack of Steven Argila. Ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between his director, DeFelitta and Paul Reiser who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film is clearly intended for an older audience, it should please everyone.
