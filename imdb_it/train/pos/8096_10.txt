First of all, the only reason people continue to complain about this film is because they can't stand that some parts of the true story are "altered". Well guess what? Even Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect rendition. Quite a joke. This is a very nice movie. The backgrounds are fantastic and taken from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half of the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the Battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. Vocal casting is top notch and most of the characters look like I imagined. Samwise is a little too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn seems AMAZING. The film has an excellent score that fully supports the film. If you like beautiful fantasy stories, but you hate reading (books are even better), try this film, bearing in mind that it was made 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> Also of particular note: Peter Jackson's adaptation of La Fellowship follows almost exactly the same part as Ralph Bakshi's (Jackson said many times how much he admired Bakshi's effort).
