I haven't read anything good about this movie and finally got the chance to see it late last night and that was all I expected it to be and more. This is how an appropriate horror movie should be. I think it was so it was scary because it was so realistic. The ghostly soundtrack was perfect for setting a dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and I liked how the rest of the film took place. It was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies that are too complicated. The special effects were very good. I'd like to see other horror movies like this. This is easily one of my favorites. A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have created a nice atmosphere for this film. Then others had all the elements of a good horror film the film needs. I highly recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate a good film of fear that does not attract shots. I'll add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
