Since this is Black History Month and I'm reviewing the results of many African-Americans on the film in chronological order, I took this film on VHS from the library because there were Duke Ellington and his Orchestra. Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the culmination of this comedy for mystery-comedy comedies, mostly murderous. Many other numbers that I liked were mainly "Sweet Marijuana" by Kitty Carlisle, "Cocktails for Two" by Carl Brisson and her duet with Carlisle on the previous one, and those by Gertrude Michael who is as big as the woman you love to hate . Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably go a little too long with their love / hate jokes as a producer and detective but they grow on you. And Toby Wing is a silly sexy provocateur like Nancy who keeps trying to say something to Oakie but gets a "Not now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a reason for the murders that happen, I was not surprised by the revelation of those who did. And take a lot of how naked women are here (even if their breasts are obviously covered, or by their hands or a light top). This was obviously pre-code. It's worth taking a look at any movie fan interested in this kind of thing. Postscript As a long-time Louisiana resident, I like to notice when someone was born here because Carlisle was originally from New Orleans.
