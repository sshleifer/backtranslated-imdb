Taking an old collection of stories poses a challenge to the production team, how this classic character can be updated and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while mixing the memories of his former audience. In my opinion, their mission was accomplished. A must see for children, pre-teens, adolescents and their parents. OK, there are a couple of scary moments that are solved in a short time, but parents with young children should sit down, the film gets better. I'm going to go with those cunning users who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, not syrupy about it. Nancy balances her femininity with career-oriented investigator skills. I really like it in here, he laughs, he doesn't take himself too seriously, a real mystery to solve (one can be understood as an added bonus and nice characters. Nancy Drew is also a good movie for the date in my opinion.
