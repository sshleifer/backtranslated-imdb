An unconventional historical drama, with some beautiful battle scenes. Tobey Maguire offers excellent performance and gets a good back-up. The script is literal and quite original, and the film is mercifully kept free of heroes. That being said, it drags a bit and the last reel is too much like a TV miniseries. However, Frederick Elmes' camera continues to take an interest in boring bits (and sometimes you see a shot that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
