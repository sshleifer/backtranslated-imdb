By the early 1970s, many of us who had wholeheartedly embraced the hippy / acid / alternative culture had realized that the main company would not change the way we thought it would happen. For me this film has defined the tension of "now what?" that many of the people I knew heard at that time. Do we move towards the common and create our vision of utopia or radicalize and push for change? <br /> <br /> From futile gestures to the police, to radical rhetoric, to the music of Pink Floyd, to love -making and explosive images in the desert - there is so much inside. It captures a significant moment well over time.
