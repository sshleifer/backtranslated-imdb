If this film had been made a few years later, I would have given a lower score. However, by 1909, this was a small dandy movie and today it resists quite well. Just do not try to compare this silent film with the silences later - the industry has changed so radically that the short films of the first decade of the 20th century do not seem at all like films of 1910 and beyond. <br /> <br /> This film is 11 minutes long (about average for most of the movies back then) and is a variation on the story of Edgar Allen Poe, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I won't go into it further because I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice it to say that it is very disturbing !!
