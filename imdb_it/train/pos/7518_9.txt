Beautifully crafted with a wonderful interpretation of Gretchen Moll that captures such unblemished happiness in her work, and the recreations of small films and photographs are perfectly realized and often hilarious. According to Harron they used films no longer produced and 50s style studio lamps, even for external locations, to give a distinctive appearance to the portions of color. Bettie Page saw the film at Hugh Heffner's house (now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not with the director, in case it was embarrassing if she didn't like it. Apparently he did it until the official investigation, which he found disturbing. Some great costumes also. The idea for the film began in 1993, but it was worth it. His portrait never seems false in reference to all those images and fragments of (terrible) films that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting complement with Goodnight and Goodluck, but a much more pleasant view!
